I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### ANALYSIS
There are multiple bugs in the provided code.

1. The code incorrectly calculates the possible values of D. It should calculate the absolute difference between each element of the array and the minimum value, instead, it is calculating the difference between each element and the maximum value.

2. The code incorrectly checks if all values become equal after applying D. It should check if the difference between each element and the minimum value is divisible by D, instead, it is checking if the difference between each element and the maximum value is divisible by D.

3. The code does not handle the case where there is only one element in the array. In this case, since all values are already equal, the minimum value of D is 0.

4. The code does not handle the case where all values in the array are equal. In this case, since there is no need to perform any operations, the minimum value of D is 0.

### BUGS
#### Bug 1
The code incorrectly calculates the possible values of D. It should calculate the absolute difference between each element of the array and the minimum value, instead, it is calculating the difference between each element and the maximum value.

#### Bug 2
The code incorrectly checks if all values become equal after applying D. It should check if the difference between each element and the minimum value is divisible by D, instead, it is checking if the difference between each element and the maximum value is divisible by D.

#### Bug 3
The code does not handle the case where there is only one element in the array. In this case, since all values are already equal, the minimum value of D is 0.

#### Bug 4
The code does not handle the case where all values in the array are equal. In this case, since there is no need to perform any operations, the minimum value of D is 0.

### IMPACT
These bugs impact the correctness of the program's functionality. The incorrect calculation of possible values of D and the incorrect check for equality after applying D can lead to wrong outputs. The missing handling of cases where there is only one element in the array or all values are equal can result in incorrect outputs or failure to provide any output.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
1. Calculate the possible values of D by finding the absolute difference between each element and the minimum value, rather than the maximum value.

2. Check if the difference between each element and the minimum value is divisible by D, rather than the maximum value.

3. Handle the case where there is only one element in the array separately by checking if the length of the array is equal to 1.

4. Handle the case where all values in the array are already equal by checking if the count of distinct values in the array is equal to 1.

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### REVIEW

The code provided above has some logical errors and bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's identify and discuss them in detail.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect calculation of `min_diff`
In the code, the variable `min_diff` is initialized with the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. It is used to store the minimum difference that makes all values equal. However, the initial value of `min_diff` is incorrect because the range of `D` starts from 0. The minimum difference can never be greater than the maximum difference between any two values in the array. Therefore, `min_diff` should be initialized with the maximum difference between any two values, rather than positive infinity.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect flag check for all_equal
The code uses a flag variable `all_equal` to determine whether all values can be made equal by adding or subtracting `D`. However, the flag is incorrectly implemented. It is initialized as `True` at the beginning of each iteration, but it is not updated correctly based on the conditions inside the loops. In fact, the flag is only updated if the new values are not within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`. This means that the flag will always be `True` if the new values are within the range, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect condition to break the loop
The code uses a nested loop to check if all values can be made equal. However, the inner loop is intended to break if the new values are not equal. However, the current condition to break the loop is incorrect. It only checks if the new values are not equal, without considering other conditions. This means that the loop will break if any of the new values are not equal, even if they are within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`.

#### Bug 4: Incorrect final output condition
The final condition to output the minimum difference is incorrect. The code compares `min_diff` with `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. However, if `min_diff` is not updated with a valid value, it will still be equal to positive infinity, resulting in incorrect output. Instead, the code should check if `min_diff` is less than positive infinity to determine if a valid minimum difference has been found.

#### Impact on functionality
These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The incorrect calculation of `min_diff`, incorrect flag check for `all_equal`, incorrect condition to break the loop, and incorrect final output condition all lead to incorrect output. In some cases, the program may output -1 when a valid minimum difference exists, or it may also output a non-negative value when it is not possible to make all values equal.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
To fix the bugs mentioned above and improve the functionality of the program, the following changes can be made:

1. Update the initialization of `min_diff` to be the maximum difference between any two values in the array:
``` python
min_diff = max_a - min_a
```
2. Correct the flag check for `all_equal` by updating it based on whether the new values are equal or not. Remove the condition that checks if the new values are within the range:
``` python
all_equal = (new_value == other_new_value)
```
3. Update the condition to break the loop by considering whether the new values are within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`:
``` python
if new_value < min_a or new_value > max_a or other_new_value < min_a or other_new_value > max_a:
    all_equal = False
    break
```
4. Update the final output condition to check if `min_diff` is less than positive infinity:
``` python
if min_diff < float('inf'):
    print(min_diff)
else:
    print(-1)
```

### Pseudocode with the suggested improvements
``` python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_a = min(a)
max_a = max(a)

if min_a == max_a:
    print(0)
    exit()

min_diff = max_a - min_a

for D in range(max_a - min_a + 1):
    all_equal = True
    for i in range(n):
        new_value = a[i] + D
        if new_value < min_a or new_value > max_a:
            all_equal = False
            break
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
                continue
            other_new_value = a[j] - D
            if other_new_value < min_a or other_new_value > max_a:
                all_equal = False
                break
            if new_value != other_new_value:
                all_equal = False
                break
        if not all_equal:
            break
    if all_equal:
        min_diff = min(min_diff, D)

if min_diff < float('inf'):
    print(min_diff)
else:
    print(-1)
```

By making these improvements, it is expected that the code will produce the correct output for various test cases. Remember that this pseudocode only includes proposed changes to fix the bugs mentioned above.

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

" but the expected output was "3
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided above has some logical errors and bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's identify and discuss them in detail.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect calculation of `min_diff`
In the code, the variable `min_diff` is initialized with the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. It is used to store the minimum difference that makes all values equal. However, the initial value of `min_diff` is incorrect because the range of `D` starts from 0. The minimum difference can never be greater than the maximum difference between any two values in the array. Therefore, `min_diff` should be initialized with the maximum difference between any two values, rather than positive infinity.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect flag check for all_equal
The code uses a flag variable `all_equal` to determine whether all values can be made equal by adding or subtracting `D`. However, the flag is incorrectly implemented. It is initialized as `True` at the beginning of each iteration, but it is not updated correctly based on the conditions inside the loops. In fact, the flag is only updated if the new values are not within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`. This means that the flag will always be `True` if the new values are within the range, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect condition to break the loop
The code uses a nested loop to check if all values can be made equal. However, the inner loop is intended to break if the new values are not equal. However, the current condition to break the loop is incorrect. It only checks if the new values are not equal, without considering other conditions. This means that the loop will break if any of the new values are not equal, even if they are within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`.

#### Bug 4: Incorrect final output condition
The final condition to output the minimum difference is incorrect. The code compares `min_diff` with `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. However, if `min_diff` is not updated with a valid value, it will still be equal to positive infinity, resulting in incorrect output. Instead, the code should check if `min_diff` is less than positive infinity to determine if a valid minimum difference has been found.

#### Impact on functionality
These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The incorrect calculation of `min_diff`, incorrect flag check for `all_equal`, incorrect condition to break the loop, and incorrect final output condition all lead to incorrect output. In some cases, the program may output -1 when a valid minimum difference exists, or it may also output a non-negative value when it is not possible to make all values equal.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
To fix the bugs mentioned above and improve the functionality of the program, the following changes can be made:

1. Update the initialization of `min_diff` to be the maximum difference between any two values in the array:
``` python
min_diff = max_a - min_a
```
2. Correct the flag check for `all_equal` by updating it based on whether the new values are equal or not. Remove the condition that checks if the new values are within the range:
``` python
all_equal = (new_value == other_new_value)
```
3. Update the condition to break the loop by considering whether the new values are within the range of `min_a` and `max_a`:
``` python
if new_value < min_a or new_value > max_a or other_new_value < min_a or other_new_value > max_a:
    all_equal = False
    break
```
4. Update the final output condition to check if `min_diff` is less than positive infinity:
``` python
if min_diff < float('inf'):
    print(min_diff)
else:
    print(-1)
```

### Pseudocode with the suggested improvements
``` python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_a = min(a)
max_a = max(a)

if min_a == max_a:
    print(0)
    exit()

min_diff = max_a - min_a

for D in range(max_a - min_a + 1):
    all_equal = True
    for i in range(n):
        new_value = a[i] + D
        if new_value < min_a or new_value > max_a:
            all_equal = False
            break
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
                continue
            other_new_value = a[j] - D
            if other_new_value < min_a or other_new_value > max_a:
                all_equal = False
                break

                all_equal = False
                break
