I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
 - A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### ANALYSIS

The provided code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible values of K and count the number of ARC and ABC problems for each K. It checks if the counts are equal and increments the `count` variable if they are. Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

There are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Inefficient algorithm**: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is not efficient enough to handle large inputs within the time limit. We need to optimize the algorithm to improve its efficiency.

2. **Inaccurate counting**: The code counts the number of ARC and ABC problems using two loops. However, the counting is not accurate because both loops iterate over all the problems in each iteration of the outer loop. This leads to incorrect counts.

3. **Incorrect range for K**: The current range for the variable K is from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that K should be an integer, and it is not necessary for it to correspond to an actual difficulty level.

4. **Incorrect termination condition for outer loop**: The outer loop iterates from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. However, the correct termination condition should be `max_difficulty` because the highest difficulty should be included in the range of possible values for K.

5. **Incorrect check for equal counts**: The code checks if the counts of ARC and ABC problems are equal using the condition `if count_ARC == count_ABC`. However, this condition is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the number of ARC and ABC problems should be the same, not their counts.

Now, let's go through these issues in detail and discuss their impact on the program's functionality.

" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "102
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The provided code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible values of K and count the number of ARC and ABC problems for each K. It checks if the counts are equal and increments the `count` variable if they are. Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

There are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Inefficient algorithm**: The current algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), which is not efficient enough to handle large inputs within the time limit. We need to optimize the algorithm to improve its efficiency.

2. **Inaccurate counting**: The code counts the number of ARC and ABC problems using two loops. However, the counting is not accurate because both loops iterate over all the problems in each iteration of the outer loop. This leads to incorrect counts.

3. **Incorrect range for K**: The current range for the variable K is from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that K should be an integer, and it is not necessary for it to correspond to an actual difficulty level.

4. **Incorrect termination condition for outer loop**: The outer loop iterates from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. However, the correct termination condition should be `max_difficulty` because the highest difficulty should be included in the range of possible values for K.

5. **Incorrect check for equal counts**: The code checks if the counts of ARC and ABC problems are equal using the condition `if count_ARC == count_ABC`. However, this condition is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the number of ARC and ABC problems should be the same, not their counts.

Now, let's go through these issues in detail and discuss their impact on the program's functionality.

### ISSUE 1:
The provided code uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible values of K, resulting in a time complexity of O(N^2). This algorithm is not efficient enough to handle large inputs within the time limit.

### IMPACT:
The inefficient algorithm causes the program to exceed the time limit for large inputs, leading to an incorrect output or an error.

### SOLUTION 1:
We can optimize the algorithm by finding a more efficient approach to solve the problem.

### ISSUE 2:
The current code counts the number of ARC and ABC problems using two loops. However, the counting is not accurate because both loops iterate over all the problems in each iteration of the outer loop. This leads to incorrect counts.

### IMPACT:
The incorrect counting results in incorrect values for `count_ARC` and `count_ABC`, leading to incorrect comparison and increment of the `count` variable.

### SOLUTION 2:
To accurately count the number of ARC and ABC problems, we need to iterate through the list of difficulties only once, updating the respective counts based on the current difficulty and the value of K.

### ISSUE 3:
The current code sets the range for the variable K from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. However, this is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that K should be an integer, and it is not necessary for it to correspond to an actual difficulty level.

### IMPACT:
The incorrect range for K may result in missing valid choices for K, leading to an incorrect count.

### SOLUTION 3:
To determine the valid choices for K, we need to consider all integer values between the minimum and maximum difficulties, inclusive.

### ISSUE 4:
The outer loop in the current code iterates from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty+1`. However, the correct termination condition should be `max_difficulty` because the highest difficulty should be included in the range of possible values for K.

### IMPACT:
The current termination condition prevents the highest difficulty level from being considered as a valid choice for K, leading to an incorrect count.

### SOLUTION 4:
To include the highest difficulty level in the range of valid choices for K, we need to update the termination condition of the outer loop to `max_difficulty`.

### ISSUE 5:
The code checks if the counts of ARC and ABC problems are equal using the condition `if count_ARC == count_ABC`. However, this condition is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the number of ARC and ABC problems should be the same, not their counts.

### IMPACT:
The current condition for checking equal counts will result in incorrect values for `count`.

### SOLUTION 5:
To check if the number of ARC and ABC problems is the same, we need to compare the counts of ARC and ABC problems once we have finished iterating through the difficulties for a specific value of K.

Now, let's implement these fixes in the code.

### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
 - A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### CODE REVIEW

There are several bugs in the provided code:

#### Bug 1: Incorrect formula for determining ARCs and ABCs
The formula used to determine whether a problem should go to ARCs or ABCs is incorrect. The code checks if the difficulty is greater than or equal to half of the minimum difficulty in the list. However, this formula does not guarantee an equal number of problems for ARCs and ABCs. For example, if the minimum difficulty is 1 and we have two problems with difficulty 1, one will go to ARCs and one will go to ABCs, resulting in an imbalance. 

#### Bug 2: Incorrect initialization of `num_choices`
The variable `num_choices` is initialized outside of the loop that counts the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs. This means that `num_choices` will always have a value of either 0 or 1, depending on whether the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal after the loop. 

#### Bug 3: Missing loop to iterate through choices of K
The code is missing a loop to iterate through all possible choices of K. As a result, it only checks whether the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal for the first choice of K, but not for the other choices. 

#### Bug 4: Incorrect condition for counting ARCs and ABCs
The condition used to count problems for ARCs is incorrect. The code checks if the difficulty is greater than or equal to half of the minimum difficulty in the list, but it should be checking if the difficulty is greater than or equal to K. 

#### Bug 5: Incorrect condition for checking equal number of problems
The condition used to check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal is incorrect. The code checks if `count_ARC` is equal to `count_ABC`, but it should be checking if twice `count_ARC` is equal to `N`. This is because we want an equal number of problems for both categories. 

### Suggested Solution
The code needs to be corrected as follows:
1. Initialize `num_choices` outside the loop to count the number of choices of K.
2. Add a loop to iterate through all possible choices of K.
3. Fix the condition to determine problems for ARCs and ABCs.
4. Fix the condition to check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize num_choices
num_choices = 0

# Iterate through all possible choices of K
for K in range(min(difficulties), max(difficulties) + 1):
    # Count the number of problems that will go to ARCs and ABCs
    count_ARC = 0
    count_ABC = 0
    for difficulty in difficulties:
        if difficulty >= K:
            count_ARC += 1
        else:
            count_ABC += 1

    # Check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal
    if 2 * count_ARC == N:
        num_choices += 1

# Print the number of choices
print(num_choices)
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the number of problems that will go to ARCs and ABCs
count_ARC = 0
count_ABC = 0
for difficulty in difficulties:
    if difficulty >= min(difficulties)//2:
        count_ARC += 1
    else:
        count_ABC += 1

# Find the number of choices of K that make count_ARC and count_ABC the same
num_choices = 0
if count_ARC == count_ABC:
    num_choices += 1

# Print the number of choices
print(num_choices)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
9 1 4 4 6 7
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "2
".

### QUESTION
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
 - A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the number of problems that will go to ARCs and ABCs
count_ARC = 0
count_ABC = 0
for difficulty in difficulties:
    if difficulty >= min(difficulties)//2:
        count_ARC += 1
    else:
        count_ABC += 1

# Find the number of choices of K that make count_ARC and count_ABC the same
num_choices = 0
if count_ARC == count_ABC:
    num_choices += 1

# Print the number of choices
print(num_choices)
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
9 1 4 4 6 7
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "2
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### CODE REVIEW

There are several bugs in the provided code:

#### Bug 1: Incorrect formula for determining ARCs and ABCs
The formula used to determine whether a problem should go to ARCs or ABCs is incorrect. The code checks if the difficulty is greater than or equal to half of the minimum difficulty in the list. However, this formula does not guarantee an equal number of problems for ARCs and ABCs. For example, if the minimum difficulty is 1 and we have two problems with difficulty 1, one will go to ARCs and one will go to ABCs, resulting in an imbalance. 

#### Bug 2: Incorrect initialization of `num_choices`
The variable `num_choices` is initialized outside of the loop that counts the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs. This means that `num_choices` will always have a value of either 0 or 1, depending on whether the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal after the loop. 

#### Bug 3: Missing loop to iterate through choices of K
The code is missing a loop to iterate through all possible choices of K. As a result, it only checks whether the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal for the first choice of K, but not for the other choices. 

#### Bug 4: Incorrect condition for counting ARCs and ABCs
The condition used to count problems for ARCs is incorrect. The code checks if the difficulty is greater than or equal to half of the minimum difficulty in the list, but it should be checking if the difficulty is greater than or equal to K. 

#### Bug 5: Incorrect condition for checking equal number of problems
The condition used to check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal is incorrect. The code checks if `count_ARC` is equal to `count_ABC`, but it should be checking if twice `count_ARC` is equal to `N`. This is because we want an equal number of problems for both categories. 

### Suggested Solution
The code needs to be corrected as follows:
1. Initialize `num_choices` outside the loop to count the number of choices of K.
2. Add a loop to iterate through all possible choices of K.
3. Fix the condition to determine problems for ARCs and ABCs.
4. Fix the condition to check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize num_choices
num_choices = 0

# Iterate through all possible choices of K
for K in range(min(difficulties), max(difficulties) + 1):
    # Count the number of problems that will go to ARCs and ABCs
    count_ARC = 0
    count_ABC = 0
    for difficulty in difficulties:
        if difficulty >= K:
            count_ARC += 1
        else:
            count_ABC += 1

    # Check if the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs is equal
    if 2 * count_ARC == N:
        num_choices += 1

# Print the number of choices
print(num_choices)
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
