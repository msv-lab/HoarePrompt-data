I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you

### QUESTION
Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. 

Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $n = 6$, $r = 2$ and heaters are at positions $2$ and $5$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $3$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $3$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).

Initially, all the heaters are off.

But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the minimum number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.

Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 1000$) — the number of elements in the array and the value of heaters.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the Vova's house description.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house or -1 if it is impossible to do it.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1

Output
3

Input
5 3
1 0 0 0 1

Output
2

Input
5 10
0 0 0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
10 3
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.
### Requirements

### Feedback 1

### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The condition `(i < r-1 or i > n-r)` in line 11 is incorrect. It should be `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)` in order to allow for the last few elements of the house to be warmed up by the last heater.

2. The condition `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)` in line 11 should not be checked when the element itself is 1 (already warmed up). It should only be checked when the element is 0 (cold position).

3. The loop range in line 16 is incorrect. It should be `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n+1))` instead of `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n))` to include the element `n` in the iteration.

4. The condition `last_heater != -1` in line 26 should not be used to determine if there is a previous heater position. Instead, it should check if `last_heater` is not within the range of the current position `i-r+1` to `i+r-1`.

5. The condition in line 26 should be `if last_heater < i-r+1 or last_heater > i+r-1:` instead of `if last_heater != -1:`.

6. The code does not account for the case where there is a reachable heater position after the last element of the house. This case should be checked after the loop in line 23.

### IMPACT
The bugs identified above impact the program's functionality as follows:

1. The incorrect condition in line 11 prevents the last few elements of the house from being warmed up by the last heater. This may result in an incomplete warming of the house.

2. The incorrect condition in line 11 may cause some elements that are already warmed up to be considered for switching on an adjacent heater. This would lead to a higher number of heaters being switched on than necessary.

3. The loop range in line 16 excludes the last element of the house from being considered as a reachable heater position. This may result in some elements near the end of the house not being warmed up.

4. The incorrect condition in line 26 allows for switching on a new heater even if there is already a previous heater position within range. This leads to a higher number of heaters being switched on than necessary.

5. The code does not check for a reachable heater position after the last element of the house. This may result in an incomplete warming of the house.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
1. Change the condition in line 11 from `(i < r-1 or i > n-r)` to `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)`.

2. Add an additional condition in line 11 to exclude elements that are already warmed up from being considered for switching on an adjacent heater. The condition should be `and a[i] == 0`.

3. Change the loop range in line 16 from `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n))` to `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n+1))`.

4. Change the condition in line 26 from `if last_heater != -1:` to `if last_heater < i-r+1 or last_heater > i+r-1:`.

5. Check if there is a reachable heater position after the last element of the house after the loop in line 23.

Considering these improvements, the corrected code is as follows:

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1
" the output was "1
" but the expected output was "3
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The condition `(i < r-1 or i > n-r)` in line 11 is incorrect. It should be `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)` in order to allow for the last few elements of the house to be warmed up by the last heater.

2. The condition `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)` in line 11 should not be checked when the element itself is 1 (already warmed up). It should only be checked when the element is 0 (cold position).

3. The loop range in line 16 is incorrect. It should be `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n+1))` instead of `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n))` to include the element `n` in the iteration.

4. The condition `last_heater != -1` in line 26 should not be used to determine if there is a previous heater position. Instead, it should check if `last_heater` is not within the range of the current position `i-r+1` to `i+r-1`.

5. The condition in line 26 should be `if last_heater < i-r+1 or last_heater > i+r-1:` instead of `if last_heater != -1:`.

6. The code does not account for the case where there is a reachable heater position after the last element of the house. This case should be checked after the loop in line 23.

### IMPACT
The bugs identified above impact the program's functionality as follows:

1. The incorrect condition in line 11 prevents the last few elements of the house from being warmed up by the last heater. This may result in an incomplete warming of the house.

2. The incorrect condition in line 11 may cause some elements that are already warmed up to be considered for switching on an adjacent heater. This would lead to a higher number of heaters being switched on than necessary.

3. The loop range in line 16 excludes the last element of the house from being considered as a reachable heater position. This may result in some elements near the end of the house not being warmed up.

4. The incorrect condition in line 26 allows for switching on a new heater even if there is already a previous heater position within range. This leads to a higher number of heaters being switched on than necessary.

5. The code does not check for a reachable heater position after the last element of the house. This may result in an incomplete warming of the house.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
1. Change the condition in line 11 from `(i < r-1 or i > n-r)` to `(i < r-1 or i > n-r+1)`.

2. Add an additional condition in line 11 to exclude elements that are already warmed up from being considered for switching on an adjacent heater. The condition should be `and a[i] == 0`.

3. Change the loop range in line 16 from `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n))` to `range(i+1, min(i+r+1, n+1))`.

4. Change the condition in line 26 from `if last_heater != -1:` to `if last_heater < i-r+1 or last_heater > i+r-1:`.

5. Check if there is a reachable heater position after the last element of the house after the loop in line 23.

memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. 

Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $n = 6$, $r = 2$ and heaters are at positions $2$ and $5$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $3$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $3$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).

Initially, all the heaters are off.

But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the minimum number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.

Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 1000$) — the number of elements in the array and the value of heaters.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the Vova's house description.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house or -1 if it is impossible to do it.

-----Note-----

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### ANALYSIS
There are multiple bugs in the code provided.

#### Bug 1:
The first bug is in the if statement `if house[i] == 1:`. This if statement checks if there is a heater at position `i`, but it should actually check if there is a heater within range `r` of position `i`. This is because a heater can warm up all the elements in range `[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]`. So the correct condition should be `if house[i] == 1 and (i - r + 1 >= 0 or i + r - 1 < n):`.

#### Bug 2:
The second bug is in the inner loop `for j in range(i - r + 1, i + r):`. This loop should only iterate over the range of elements that can be warmed up by the heater at position `i` (i.e. `range(max(0, i - r + 1), min(n, i + r))`). This is because `i - r + 1` and `i + r` can be out of range for the house array. So the correct loop should be `for j in range(max(0, i - r + 1), min(n, i + r)):`.

#### Bug 3:
The third bug is in the final check to see if the whole house is warmed up. The check `if house[i] == 0 and heaters[i] == 0:` is incorrect. This check should only be performed on the elements that are within range `r` of a heater. So the correct loop should be `for i in range(max(0, i - r + 1), min(n, i + r)):`.

#### Bug 4:
The fourth bug is in the counting logic. The counter `count` is incremented every time there is a heater at position `i`. However, this logic does not take into account if there is a heated range that is already covered by a previous heater. In other words, if there is a heater at position `i` and there is already a heated range that covers the position, then we don't need to increment the counter. To fix this, we need to keep track of the ranges covered by the heaters and only increment the counter if the range is not already covered. We can do this by having a separate array `cover` that keeps track of the coverage by the heaters.
