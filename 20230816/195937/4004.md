### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

### ANALYSIS

The code aims to find the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if this value is added to some $a_i$, subtracted from some $a_i$, or left unchanged, all values in the sequence become equal. If it is not possible to find such a value $D$, then the code should output -1.

Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. The implementation of the code is incorrect. It does not handle the case when all values in the sequence are already equal. In this case, the code should output 0, but it currently does not.

2. The code calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum values in the sequence. However, this is not the correct approach to finding the minimum value of $D$ that will make all the values equal. The correct approach is to find the mode of the sequence, which is the value that occurs the most number of times. Then, we can calculate the number of operations needed to make all values equal to the mode.

3. The code checks if the difference between the minimum and maximum values is divisible by 2 and if the difference between a value and the minimum value is divisible by 2. However, this is not a valid condition for determining if it is possible to make all values equal. Instead, we should check if the difference between a value and the mode is divisible by 2.

4. The loop that checks if it is possible to make all values equal incorrectly breaks when the condition is satisfied. It should break when the condition is not satisfied.

5. The code is missing input validation. It does not check if the input values are within the allowed constraints.

Now that we have identified the bugs, let's discuss their impact on the program's functionality:

- Bug 1: The code does not handle the case when all values in the sequence are already equal. This bug has a major impact on the program's functionality because it does not output the correct result for this case.

- Bug 2: The code calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum values in the sequence instead of finding the mode. This bug has a major impact on the program's functionality because it calculates an incorrect value for $D$.

- Bug 3: The code uses an incorrect condition to check if it is possible to make all values equal. This bug has a major impact on the program's functionality because it incorrectly determines if it is possible to make all values equal.

- Bug 4: The code incorrectly breaks the loop when the condition is satisfied. This bug has a minor impact on the program's functionality because it does not affect the final result, but it introduces an unnecessary loop iteration.

- Bug 5: The code does not perform input validation. This bug does not affect the correctness of the result, but it can lead to undesired behavior if the input values are outside the allowed constraints.

In summary, the bugs in the code have a major impact on its functionality. The code does not correctly handle the case when all values are already equal, it calculates an incorrect value for $D$, it uses an incorrect condition to check if it is possible to make all values equal, and it does not validate the input values.

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### ANALYSIS
Let's analyze the code step by step to identify the bugs and understand the impact they have on the program's functionality.

#### Bug 1: Checking if all values are equal
```
if diff % (n-1) == 0 and len(set(a)) == 1:
```
The code checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values is divisible by (n-1) and if the length of the set of values is equal to 1. However, this check is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all the values in the array are equal. It only checks if all the values are the same as the maximum or minimum value.

Impact: This bug causes the code to give incorrect results when there are equal values in the array that are not the maximum or minimum values.

#### Bug 2: Calculating the value of D
```
D = diff // (n-1)
```
The code calculates the value of D by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by (n-1). However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the difference should be evenly distributed across all the values in the array. This is not necessarily true because the goal is to make all the values equal, not to distribute the difference equally.

Impact: This bug causes the code to give incorrect values of D when the array contains duplicate values that are not all the same.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect output when no solution is possible
```
print(-1)
```
The code prints -1 when the conditions for finding a solution are not met. However, this is not always the correct output because it is possible that a solution exists but the conditions are not satisfied. For example, when the array contains duplicate values but they are not all the same, there may still be a value of D that can make all the values equal.

Impact: This bug causes the code to incorrectly output -1 when a solution may still exist.

### BUG SUMMARY
1. Checking if all values are equal: This bug causes the code to give incorrect results when there are equal values in the array that are not the maximum or minimum values.
2. Calculating the value of D: This bug causes the code to give incorrect values of D when the array contains duplicate values that are not all the same.
3. Incorrect output when no solution is possible: This bug causes the code to incorrectly output -1 when a solution may still exist.

You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ consisting of $n$ integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer $D$ (i.e. $D \ge 0$), and for each $a_i$ you can:

  add $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i + D$, or  subtract $D$ (only once), i. e. perform $a_i := a_i - D$, or  leave the value of $a_i$ unchanged. 

It is possible that after an operation the value $a_i$ becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer $D$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $a_i$ are equal (i.e. $a_1=a_2=\dots=a_n$).

Print the required $D$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

For example, for array $[2, 8]$ the value $D=3$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $[5, 5]$ if you will add $D$ to $2$ and subtract $D$ from $8$. And for array $[1, 4, 7, 7]$ the value $D=3$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $1$ and subtract it from $7$ and obtain the array $[4, 4, 4, 4]$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in $a$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the sequence $a$.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value $D$ such that if you add this value to some $a_i$, subtract this value from some $a_i$ and leave some $a_i$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value $D$, print -1.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the maximum and minimum values in the array
max_val = max(a)
min_val = min(a)

# Diff is the difference between max and min values
diff = max_val - min_val

# Check if the difference is divisible by (n-1) and if all the values are equal
if diff % (n-1) == 0 and len(set(a)) == 1:
    # Calculate the value of D
    D = diff // (n-1)
    print(D)
else:
    print(-1)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
1 4 4 7 4 1
" the output was "-1
" but the expected output was "3
".

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
1 4 4 7 4 1
" the output was "-1
" but the expected output was "3
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
Let's analyze the code step by step to identify the bugs and understand the impact they have on the program's functionality.

#### Bug 1: Checking if all values are equal
```
if diff % (n-1) == 0 and len(set(a)) == 1:
```
The code checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values is divisible by (n-1) and if the length of the set of values is equal to 1. However, this check is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all the values in the array are equal. It only checks if all the values are the same as the maximum or minimum value.

Impact: This bug causes the code to give incorrect results when there are equal values in the array that are not the maximum or minimum values.

#### Bug 2: Calculating the value of D
```
D = diff // (n-1)
```
The code calculates the value of D by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by (n-1). However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the difference should be evenly distributed across all the values in the array. This is not necessarily true because the goal is to make all the values equal, not to distribute the difference equally.

Impact: This bug causes the code to give incorrect values of D when the array contains duplicate values that are not all the same.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect output when no solution is possible
```
print(-1)
```
The code prints -1 when the conditions for finding a solution are not met. However, this is not always the correct output because it is possible that a solution exists but the conditions are not satisfied. For example, when the array contains duplicate values but they are not all the same, there may still be a value of D that can make all the values equal.

Impact: This bug causes the code to incorrectly output -1 when a solution may still exist.

### BUG SUMMARY
1. Checking if all values are equal: This bug causes the code to give incorrect results when there are equal values in the array that are not the maximum or minimum values.
2. Calculating the value of D: This bug causes the code to give incorrect values of D when the array contains duplicate values that are not all the same.
3. Incorrect output when no solution is possible: This bug causes the code to incorrectly output -1 when a solution may still exist.
