You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you

### QUESTION
Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. 

Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $n = 6$, $r = 2$ and heaters are at positions $2$ and $5$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $3$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $3$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).

Initially, all the heaters are off.

But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the minimum number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.

Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 1000$) — the number of elements in the array and the value of heaters.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the Vova's house description.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house or -1 if it is impossible to do it.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1

Output
3

Input
5 3
1 0 0 0 1

Output
2

Input
5 10
0 0 0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
10 3
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### BUG 1:
The first bug is in the line `end_position = min(n - 1, i + r - 1)`. Here, `n - 1` should be replaced with `n`. This is because the indices of the array `a` are from `0` to `n-1`. So, the last valid index is `n-1` and not `n-2`. By using `n - 1` in the `min` function, the end position of the heater will always be less than the actual last position of the array. This bug causes the last heater to not cover the last element of the array. In the given example, the last heater at position `6` does not cover the last element at position `5`. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `2` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### BUG 2:
The second bug is in the condition `if start_position > last_heater_position`. Here, the condition should be `if start_position > last_heater_position + 1`. This is because the `start_position` is calculated as `max(0, i - r + 1)`, which means it is inclusive of the `i - r + 1` position. However, the `last_heater_position` is the end position of the previous heater, which means it is exclusive of that position. So, to check if the current position is covered by the last heater, we need to compare `start_position` with `last_heater_position + 1`. This bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the position `5` is covered by the heater at position `3`. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `2` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### BUG 3:
The third bug is in the line `if last_heater_position < n - 1:`. Here, the condition should be `if last_heater_position < n:`. This is because the `last_heater_position` is the end position of the last heater, which means it is exclusive of that position. So, the `last_heater_position` should be compared with `n`, and not `n - 1`. This bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the last position `5` is not covered by any heaters. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `-1` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### IMPACT:
The bugs described above cause the code to output incorrect answers. The first bug causes the last element to not be covered by any heaters, the second bug causes the code to assume that certain positions are covered by heaters when they are not, and the third bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the last position is not covered by any heaters. These bugs collectively result in the code producing incorrect outputs for various test cases.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "3
".The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUG 1:
The first bug is in the line `end_position = min(n - 1, i + r - 1)`. Here, `n - 1` should be replaced with `n`. This is because the indices of the array `a` are from `0` to `n-1`. So, the last valid index is `n-1` and not `n-2`. By using `n - 1` in the `min` function, the end position of the heater will always be less than the actual last position of the array. This bug causes the last heater to not cover the last element of the array. In the given example, the last heater at position `6` does not cover the last element at position `5`. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `2` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### BUG 2:
The second bug is in the condition `if start_position > last_heater_position`. Here, the condition should be `if start_position > last_heater_position + 1`. This is because the `start_position` is calculated as `max(0, i - r + 1)`, which means it is inclusive of the `i - r + 1` position. However, the `last_heater_position` is the end position of the previous heater, which means it is exclusive of that position. So, to check if the current position is covered by the last heater, we need to compare `start_position` with `last_heater_position + 1`. This bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the position `5` is covered by the heater at position `3`. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `2` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### BUG 3:
The third bug is in the line `if last_heater_position < n - 1:`. Here, the condition should be `if last_heater_position < n:`. This is because the `last_heater_position` is the end position of the last heater, which means it is exclusive of that position. So, the `last_heater_position` should be compared with `n`, and not `n - 1`. This bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the last position `5` is not covered by any heaters. Hence, the code outputs the wrong answer of `-1` instead of the correct answer of `3`.

### IMPACT:
The bugs described above cause the code to output incorrect answers. The first bug causes the last element to not be covered by any heaters, the second bug causes the code to assume that certain positions are covered by heaters when they are not, and the third bug causes the code to incorrectly assume that the last position is not covered by any heaters. These bugs collectively result in the code producing incorrect outputs for various test cases.

Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater.

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.

2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
**Bugs**

1. The code has an off-by-one error in the condition for checking if no heater can reach the current position. The condition should be `if j < i - r + 1`, but it is written as `if j < i - r`. This bug makes the code incorrectly exit the loop and set `min_heaters` to -1 when there is at least one possible heater that can reach the current position.

2. The code incorrectly increments `min_heaters` when a heater can reach the current position. Instead of incrementing by 1, the correct increment should be `min_heaters += 1 + (i > j)` to add 1 for the current heater and the extra increment for the next position where no heater is present.

3. After finding the rightmost position where a heater can reach, the code incorrectly updates `i` to `j + r - 1`. This update skips positions in the house that can still be warmed up by the current heater. The correct update should be `i = j + r + 1` to move to the next position where no heater is present.

4. The code increments `i` after updating it in the previous step. This double increment causes the code to skip positions in the house that can still be warmed up by the current heater. The correct code should not increment `i` again.

5. The code does not handle the case when the last position in the house is not reachable by any heater. In this case, the code incorrectly increments `min_heaters` by 1 after exiting the loop. This extra increment makes the code incorrectly count an additional heater.

**Impact on Functionality**

All the bugs listed above can cause incorrect calculation of the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house. The code may incorrectly set `min_heaters` to -1, incorrectly count an additional heater, and skip positions that can still be warmed up by a heater.

As a result, the code may produce incorrect outputs for various inputs, as shown in the example provided.

### QUESTION
Vova's house is an array consisting of $n$ elements (yeah, this is the first problem, I think, where someone lives in the array). There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $i$-th element of the array is $1$ if there is a heater in the position $i$, otherwise the $i$-th element of the array is $0$.

Each heater has a value $r$ ($r$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $pos$ can warm up all the elements in range $[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$.

Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. 

Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $n = 6$, $r = 2$ and heaters are at positions $2$ and $5$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $3$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $3$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).

Initially, all the heaters are off.

But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the minimum number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.

Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 1000$) — the number of elements in the array and the value of heaters.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the Vova's house description.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum number of heaters needed to warm up the whole house or -1 if it is impossible to do it.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1

Output

Input
10 3
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the heater at the position $2$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$, the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[2, 4]$ and the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[5; 6]$ so the answer is $3$.

In the second example the heater at the position $1$ warms up elements $[1; 3]$ and the heater at the position $5$ warms up elements $[3; 5]$ so the answer is $2$.

In the third example there are no heaters so the answer is -1.

In the fourth example the heater at the position $3$ warms up elements $[1; 5]$, the heater at the position $6$ warms up elements $[4; 8]$ and the heater at the position $10$ warms up elements $[8; 10]$ so the answer is $3$.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

n, r = map(int, input().split())
house = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_heaters = 0
i = 0

while i < n:
    # If there is a heater in position i, move to the next position
    if house[i] == 1:
        i += 1
        continue
     
    # If there is no heater in position i, find the rightmost position where a heater can reach
    j = min(i + r - 1, n - 1)
    
    # If no heater can reach the current position, it is impossible to warm up the whole house
    if j < i - r + 1:
        min_heaters = -1
        break
    
    # Increment the count of heaters and move to the next position where no heater is present
    min_heaters += 1
    i = j + r - 1
    i += 1

print(min_heaters)
    
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6 2
0 1 1 0 0 1
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "3
".
