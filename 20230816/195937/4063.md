I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
 - A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
### BUGS

1. The indexing of `arc_counts` and `abc_counts` lists is incorrect. The lists should have indices from 0 to N-1, but the code is creating lists with indices from 0 to N.
2. The loop that increments `abc_counts` is using the wrong range. It should start from 1 and go up to `diff+1`, but the code is starting from 0 and going up to `diff+1`.
3. The loop that checks for the number of choices of K is using the wrong range. It should start from 0 and go up to N-1, but the code is starting from 1 and going up to N.

### IMPACT

1. The incorrect indexing of `arc_counts` and `abc_counts` will result in an `IndexError` when trying to access their elements later in the code.
2. The incorrect range in the loop that increments `abc_counts` will result in incorrect counting of problems for ABCs.
3. The incorrect range in the loop that checks for the number of choices of K will result in incorrect counting of choices that make the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs the same.

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
## Review
The code you provided seems to have a few bugs that are causing unexpected results. Let's go through your code and identify the bugs and discuss their impacts on the program's functionality.

1. Bugs in Input Parsing
The first bug I found is in the way you parse the input. The values of N and the difficulties should be passed as separate elements in the input list, but in your code, you are treating the entire line as a single string and trying to split it using a space. This is causing the difficulties to be combined together into a single string, leading to incorrect results.

2. Sorting the Difficulties
The next bug is in the sorting of the difficulties. While sorting the difficulties to find the median, you are not considering the actual values of the difficulties, which may lead to incorrect results. Instead, you should sort the difficulties in ascending order.

3. Counting the Number of Problems
The biggest bug in your code is in the way you count the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs. To count the number of problems for ARCs, you are using a list comprehension but not considering the fact that the list of difficulties is already sorted. This results in incorrect counts for ARCs and ABCs, leading to incorrect output.

4. Terminating the Loop
In your loop to find the number of choices for the integer K, you are breaking the loop as soon as the number of ARC problems is not equal to the number of ABC problems. This is incorrect because there may still be valid choices of K that satisfy the condition. Instead of breaking the loop immediately, you should continue checking all the possible choices of K.

5. Counting Valid Choices of K
The last bug I found is in the way you count the valid choices of K. You are incrementing the result variable only when the number of ARC problems is equal to the number of ABC problems. This is incorrect because there may be valid choices of K where the number of ARC problems is not equal to the number of ABC problems. To correctly count the valid choices of K, you should increment the result variable whenever the number of ARC problems is not less than the number of ABC problems.

Overall, these bugs in your code have a significant impact on the functionality of the program, causing incorrect output.

Please let me know if you need further explanation on any of the bugs I mentioned.
