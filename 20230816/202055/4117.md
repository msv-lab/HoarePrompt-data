I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

In how many ways can we choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle?
That is, find the number of triples of integers (i, j, k) (1 \leq i < j < k \leq N) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
 - L_i, L_j, and L_k are all different.
 - There exists a triangle whose sides have lengths L_i, L_j, and L_k.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq L_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
L_1 L_2 \cdots L_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of ways to choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.

-----Sample Input-----
5
4 4 9 7 5

-----Sample Output-----
5

The following five triples (i, j, k) satisfy the conditions: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), and (3, 4, 5).
### Requirements

### Feedback 1
#### Feedback
````markdown
### ANALYSIS
Looking at the code, there are a few bugs that I can identify:

1. The condition `lengths[i] + lengths[j] > lengths[k]` is incorrect. It should be `lengths[i] + lengths[j] > lengths[k] and lengths[j] + lengths[k] > lengths[i] and lengths[i] + lengths[k] > lengths[j]` to satisfy the triangle inequality.
2. The condition `lengths[i] != lengths[j] and lengths[j] != lengths[k]` is incorrect. It should be `lengths[i] != lengths[j] and lengths[j] != lengths[k] and lengths[i] != lengths[k]` to ensure that all three lengths are different.
3. The use of the `break` statement inside the loop is incorrect. It should not be used because it terminates the innermost loop, preventing all other combinations from being checked.
4. The input reading code is incorrect. It reads the value of N but does not handle the case when N = 0. Additionally, it does not split the input correctly into individual lengths.

### BUGS
1. The triangle inequality condition is incorrect.
2. The condition to check different lengths is incorrect.
3. The use of the `break` statement is incorrect.
4. The input reading code is incorrect.

### IMPACT
The bugs in the code result in incorrect output. The incorrect triangle inequality condition means that some valid triangles are not counted. The incorrect condition for different lengths means that some triangles with equal lengths are counted. The use of the `break` statement prematurely terminates the loop, leading to incorrect counts. The incorrect input reading code results in incorrect processing of the lengths.
