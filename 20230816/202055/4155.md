I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
In a flower bed, there are N flowers, numbered 1,2,......,N. Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0.
You are given a sequence h=\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \leq  k \leq N), by repeating the following "watering" operation:
 - Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \leq x \leq r.
Find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N  \leq 100
 - 0 \leq h_i \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
h_1 h_2 h_3 ...... h_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
4
1 2 2 1

-----Sample Output-----
2

The minimum number of watering operations required is 2.
One way to achieve it is:
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(1,3).
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(2,4).
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### BUG 1: Index Out of Range Error

In the given code, there is a bug that causes an index out of range error. This occurs in the following line:

```
for i in range(N-1):
```

The bug occurs because the loop is designed to iterate up to `N-1`, but the `range()` function generates values up to `N-2`. As a result, the last element of the list (`h[N-1]`) is not being considered in the loop.

To fix this bug, the range of the loop should be modified to include `N` instead of `N-1`. The correct code snippet should be:

```
for i in range(N):
```

### BUG 2: Incorrect Calculation of Watering Operations

In the given code, there is a bug in the calculation of the count of watering operations. This occurs in the following line:

```
count += (h[i+1] - h[i])
```

The bug occurs because this line only counts the difference in height between consecutive flowers. However, the task requires counting the total number of operations required to increase the height of each flower to the same as the next flower.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the calculation of the count. Each flower should be increased to the maximum height among itself and the next flower. The correct calculation should be:

```
count += max(h[i+1] - h[i], 0)
```

This will correctly calculate the number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

### Impact on Program's Functionality

Both bugs impact the correctness of the program's functionality. The first bug causes an index out of range error, which means the code produces incorrect results for all inputs where the last element of the list is not considered. The second bug causes an incorrect calculation of the count of watering operations, which leads to incorrect output for all inputs.

To fix the program and get the correct minimum number of watering operations, the two bugs described above should be addressed.

### Feedback
There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The loop should start from 1 and go up to N-1, instead of starting from 1 and going up to N. This is because the comparison `h[i] < h[i-1]` is made with the next element, and for the last element, there is no next element to compare with.

2. The condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` checks if the height of the current flower is less than the height of the previous flower. However, the problem statement mentions a specific condition for increasing the height: "Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l <= x <= r." The condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` does not satisfy this condition. To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if the height of the current flower is less than or equal to the height of the previous flower.

3. The variable `operations` is incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i]` when the condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` is true. However, we need to increment it by `h[i-1] - h[i] + 1` instead, as we need to increase the height of the current flower by 1.

Let me explain how these bugs impact the program's functionality:

First, the loop is not considering the last flower because it iterates up to N-1. This means that the comparisons and operations are not being performed for the last flower. In the given example, the last flower has a height of 1, which is less than the previous flower's height of 2. So, this condition is not being checked, resulting in incorrect output.

Additionally, the condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` is not fulfilling the requirement of increasing the height of all flowers in the given range. This condition is only checking if the height of the current flower is less than the previous flower. As a result, even if the height of the current flower is not less than the previous flower, it can still be increased if it falls within the specified range. In the given example, the second flower has a height of 2, which is not less than the previous flower's height of 1. However, it still needs to be increased to match the height of the next flower. But because of this bug, it is not being increased, resulting in incorrect output.

Lastly, the variable `operations` is not incremented correctly. It should be incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i] + 1` to satisfy the requirement of increasing the height of all flowers in the given range. Currently, it is only incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i]`, which does not account for the increase of 1. This bug is also contributing to the incorrect output.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the bugs in the code. Let me know if you have any further questions!

            ### Feedback
There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The loop should start from 1 and go up to N-1, instead of starting from 1 and going up to N. This is because the comparison `h[i] < h[i-1]` is made with the next element, and for the last element, there is no next element to compare with.

2. The condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` checks if the height of the current flower is less than the height of the previous flower. However, the problem statement mentions a specific condition for increasing the height: "Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l <= x <= r." The condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` does not satisfy this condition. To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if the height of the current flower is less than or equal to the height of the previous flower.

3. The variable `operations` is incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i]` when the condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` is true. However, we need to increment it by `h[i-1] - h[i] + 1` instead, as we need to increase the height of the current flower by 1.

Let me explain how these bugs impact the program's functionality:

First, the loop is not considering the last flower because it iterates up to N-1. This means that the comparisons and operations are not being performed for the last flower. In the given example, the last flower has a height of 1, which is less than the previous flower's height of 2. So, this condition is not being checked, resulting in incorrect output.

Additionally, the condition `h[i] < h[i-1]` is not fulfilling the requirement of increasing the height of all flowers in the given range. This condition is only checking if the height of the current flower is less than the previous flower. As a result, even if the height of the current flower is not less than the previous flower, it can still be increased if it falls within the specified range. In the given example, the second flower has a height of 2, which is not less than the previous flower's height of 1. However, it still needs to be increased to match the height of the next flower. But because of this bug, it is not being increased, resulting in incorrect output.

Lastly, the variable `operations` is not incremented correctly. It should be incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i] + 1` to satisfy the requirement of increasing the height of all flowers in the given range. Currently, it is only incremented by `h[i-1] - h[i]`, which does not account for the increase of 1. This bug is also contributing to the incorrect output.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the bugs in the code. Let me know if you have any further questions!
