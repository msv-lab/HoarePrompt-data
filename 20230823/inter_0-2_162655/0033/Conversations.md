I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Feedback

There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect results.

1. **Bug in gcd() function**: In the gcd() function, the computation of `d2` should be `gcd(a1, b2)` instead of `gcd(a1, a2)`. 

2. **Bug in x calculation loop**: The loop that calculates `x` starts from `L` and increments it by 1 in each iteration. However, it should be incremented by `d1` as we are looking for values of `x` that satisfy the condition `x = a1k' + b1 = a2l' + b2`. 

3. **Bug in the modulo condition**: In the condition to check if `x` satisfies the congruence relation with `r1` and `r2`, the modulo operations should be `% d1` and `% d2` respectively, not `% d`.  
  
4. **Bug in the modulo condition (contd.)**: The condition should also be `== r1` and `== r2` respectively, not `== 0`.

These bugs affect the calculation of `count` and lead to incorrect results.

### Bugs Summary
1. Wrong computation of `d2` in `gcd()` function.
2. Incorrect calculation of `x` increment in the loop.
3. Incorrect modulo operations in the condition to check congruence relation.
4. Incorrect comparison in the condition to check congruence relation.

### Impact on Functionality
These bugs cause the code to produce incorrect results. The calculation of `count` is impacted, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the loop iterating over `x` is not correctly iterating through all possible values, affecting the accuracy of the results.

The code contains several bugs that need to be fixed. Below is the modified code with the bugs fixed:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def solution(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R):
    # Find the common difference of each arithmetic progression
    d1 = gcd(a1, b2)
    d2 = gcd(a2, b2)
    
    # Calculate the remainders when dividing b1 and b2 by d1 and d2 respectively
    r1 = b1 % d1
    r2 = b2 % d2
    
    # Check if there exists an integer x such that L ≤ x ≤ R and x = a1k' + b1 = a2l' + b2
    count = 0
    x = L
    while x <= R:
        # Check if x is congruent to r1 modulo d1 and congruent to r2 modulo d2
        if (x - r1) % d1 == 0 and (x - r2) % d2 == 0:
            count += 1
        x += d1
    
    return count

# Read input
a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R = map(int, input().split())

# Call the solution function and print the result
result = solution(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R)
print(result)
```

Now the code should produce the correct results and pass the test cases.
