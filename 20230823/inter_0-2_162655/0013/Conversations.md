I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Now you can take online courses in the Berland State University! Polycarp needs to pass k main online courses of his specialty to get a diploma. In total n courses are availiable for the passage.

The situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).

Help Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses). Write a program which prints the order of courses. 

Polycarp passes courses consistently, he starts the next course when he finishes the previous one. Each course can't be passed more than once. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

The second line contains k distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

Then n lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the i-th of them corresponds to the course i. Each line starts from the integer t_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the number of courses on which the i-th depends. Then there follows the sequence of t_{i} distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of courses in random order, on which the i-th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^5. 


-----Output-----

Print -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty. 

Otherwise, in the first line print the integer m — the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print m distinct integers — numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage. If there are several answers it is allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
5 3
0
0
0
2 2 1
1 4
1 5

Output
5
1 2 3 4 5 

Input

Output
6
1 2 9 4 5 3 

Input
3 3
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test firstly you can take courses number 1 and 2, after that you can take the course number 4, then you can take the course number 5, which is the main. After that you have to take only the course number 3, which is the last not passed main course.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "6
1 2 3 4 5 6
" but the expected output was "5
1 2 3 4 5 
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The given code is attempting to solve the problem by performing a topological sort of the courses. However, there are several bugs in the code that need to be addressed.

#### 1. Incorrect initialization of the main_courses set
The code initializes the main_courses set using `set(map(int, input().split()))`. However, the input specifies k distinct integers as the numbers of main online-courses. Therefore, the correct initialization should be `set(input().split())` without any conversion to `int`.

#### 2. Incorrect initialization of the edges list
The code initializes the edges list using `edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]`. However, the list should have a length of n, not n+1, since the course numbers range from 1 to n.

#### 3. Incorrect calculation of indegree
The code calculates the indegree of the courses by counting the number of dependencies for each course. However, the dependencies are specified in the input as a list of distinct integers, and the first integer represents the number of dependencies. Therefore, to calculate the indegree, the code should use `indegree[i] += depends[0]`, where `depends` is the list of dependencies for the i-th course.

#### 4. Incorrect order of removing courses from main_courses
The code removes the course from the main_courses set after checking if it is in the queue. This can lead to incorrect results because a course may be removed from main_courses even if it is not the next course to be taken. To fix this, the code should remove the course from main_courses only when it is dequeued from the queue.

### BUGS
1. Incorrect initialization of the main_courses set
2. Incorrect initialization of the edges list
3. Incorrect calculation of indegree
4. Incorrect order of removing courses from main_courses

### Where the bugs occur
1. Line 7
2. Line 10
3. Line 17
4. Line 31

### Impact of the bugs
1. The main_courses set will be initialized with integer values instead of string values, which will cause incorrect comparison later in the code.
2. The edges list will have an extra element at the end, leading to out-of-range errors and incorrect indexing.
3. The indegree of the courses will be calculated incorrectly, leading to incorrect sorting and potentially missing prerequisites.
4. Courses may be removed from main_courses incorrectly, leading to incorrect results and potentially missing prerequisites.

Here's the corrected code with the fixes:

```python
import sys
from collections import deque

n, k = map(int, input().split())
main_courses = set(input().split())  # Fix 1: Remove int conversion

edges = [[] for _ in range(n)]  # Fix 2: Correct the length of edges list

indegree = [0] * n  # Fix 2: Use n instead of n+1

for i in range(n):
    depends = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]
    indegree[i] += len(depends)  # Fix 3: Correct calculation of indegree
    for course in depends:
        edges[course-1].append(i)  # Fix 2: Correct the index of edges list

queue = deque()
for i in range(n):
    if indegree[i] == 0:
        queue.append(i+1)  # Adjust the course number to be 1-based index

order = []
while queue:
    course = queue.popleft()
    order.append(course)
    if str(course) in main_courses:  # Fix 4: Check if course is in main_courses before removing
        main_courses.remove(str(course))
    for next_course in edges[course-1]:
        indegree[next_course] -= 1
        if indegree[next_course] == 0:
            queue.append(next_course + 1)  # Adjust the course number to be 1-based index

if len(main_courses) > 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(len(order))
    print(' '.join(str(course) for course in order))
```

This code should now correctly solve the problem by performing a topological sort of the courses and print the minimum number of online courses required to get the specialty in the correct order.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
