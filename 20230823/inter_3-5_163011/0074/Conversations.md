I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Dima loves representing an odd number as the sum of multiple primes, and Lisa loves it when there are at most three primes. Help them to represent the given number as the sum of at most than three primes.

More formally, you are given an odd numer n. Find a set of numbers p_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ k), such that



 1 ≤ k ≤ 3

 p_{i} is a prime

 $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i} = n$

The numbers p_{i} do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that at least one possible solution exists.


-----Input-----

The single line contains an odd number n (3 ≤ n < 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the first line print k (1 ≤ k ≤ 3), showing how many numbers are in the representation you found.

In the second line print numbers p_{i} in any order. If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
27

Output
3
5 11 11



-----Note-----

A prime is an integer strictly larger than one that is divisible only by one and by itself.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "27
" the output was "3
2 2 23
" but the expected output was "3
2 2 23".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The function `is_prime(n)` has a bug that returns False for prime numbers. The bug is in the line `for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):`. This line should skip even numbers, but it starts from 3, which means it doesn't skip the number 2. This causes the function to return False for the prime number 2.

2. The function `solve(n)` has a bug in the line `for i in range(2, n):`. The loop is inclusive of `n`, so the condition should be changed to `range(2, n+1)` to include `n`.

3. The variable `primes` is a list that stores all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. But the outer loop in the function `solve(n)` iterates from `2` to `n`, which means it includes `n` in the range. This is incorrect because a prime number solution cannot be greater than `n`. The range in the outer loop should be changed to `range(2, n)` to exclude `n`.

4. The function `solve(n)` checks all possible combinations of primes `i`, `j`, and `k` to find a solution. However, it starts the inner loops `j` and `k` from the same index as `i`. This causes duplicate and invalid solutions to be found. For example, if `i`, `j`, and `k` are all the same prime number, the function will return a solution with three identical primes. To fix this bug, the inner loops `j` and `k` should start at `i+1` instead of starting at `i`.

5. The code assumes that there will always be a solution, but it doesn't handle the case where no solution is found. If no solution is found, the function `solve(n)` should return `None`, but the code doesn't handle this case properly. The code should check if the result is `None` before printing the result in the last two lines.

6. The output format is incorrect. The code prints the values of `result[0]`, `result[1]`, and `result[2]` without taking into account that `result` can be `None`. This will raise an error if `result` is `None`. To fix this bug, the code should check if `result` is `None` before printing the values. If `result` is not `None`, it should print the values as it currently does. If `result` is `None`, it should print "No solution".

## IMPACT
1. Due to the bug in the `is_prime(n)` function, prime numbers are not correctly identified. This affects the correctness of any code that relies on the `is_prime(n)` function.

2. The bug in the `solve(n)` function causes the loop to include `n` in the iteration range when finding prime numbers to consider for the solution. This leads to incorrect prime number solutions, as prime number solutions cannot be greater than `n`.

3. The incorrect iteration range in the outer loop of the `solve(n)` function causes duplicate and invalid solutions to be found. This affects the correctness of the solution, as there should be at most three primes in the solution.

4. The code doesn't handle the case where no solution is found. This leads to incorrect output and incorrect program behavior.

5. The incorrect output format can lead to errors when printing the result, especially in the case where no solution is found.
