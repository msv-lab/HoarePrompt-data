I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at $i$-th step ($0$-indexed) you can:   either choose position $pos$ ($1 \le pos \le n$) and increase $v_{pos}$ by $k^i$;  or not choose any position and skip this step. 

You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array $v$ equal to the given array $a$ ($v_j = a_j$ for each $j$) after some step?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $2T$ lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 30$, $2 \le k \le 100$) — the size of arrays $v$ and $a$ and value $k$ used in the algorithm.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^{16}$) — the array you'd like to achieve.


-----Output-----

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array $a$ after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810

Output
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES



-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the $0$-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add $k^0$ to $v_1$ and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two $1$ in the array $v$.

In the fifth test case, you can skip $9^0$ and $9^1$, then add $9^2$ and $9^3$ to $v_3$, skip $9^4$ and finally, add $9^5$ to $v_2$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            #### Analysis

There are a few bugs in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Bug 1:** The condition to check if it is possible to achieve the array `a` is incorrect.
2. **Bug 2:** The loop range is incorrect, causing the code to check unnecessary bits.
3. **Bug 3:** The condition to check if the count is 0 or n is incorrect.
4. **Bug 4:** The variable `possible` is not reset for each test case.

Let's discuss each of these bugs in detail and propose the necessary corrections.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect Condition to Check if it is Possible to Achieve Array `a`

The condition `if all((v[j] >> i) & 1 == (a[j] >> i) & 1 for j in range(n))` is incorrect. This condition checks if all bits at position `i` of `v` are equal to all bits at position `i` of `a`. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that it is possible to achieve the array `a` after some steps.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if it is possible to achieve each element of `a` after some steps. We can achieve this by checking if the bitwise AND operation between `v[j]` and `(k-1)` is equal to `a[j]` for each `j` in range `n`.

The modified condition should be: `if all((v[j] & (k-1)) == a[j] for j in range(n))`.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect Loop Range

The code currently uses `range(62)` as the loop range, which checks unnecessary bits. This is because the maximum value of `k` is 100, which means the maximum number of iterations required is `int(100**61)`, which does not exceed `2**62`. Therefore, looping over a larger range is unnecessary and inefficient.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the loop range to `range(61)`. This will ensure that we check all the necessary bits to achieve the array `a`.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect Condition to Check Count of Bits

The condition `if cnt == 0 or cnt == n` is incorrect. This condition checks if the count of 1's in `a` is either 0 or equal to `n`. However, this condition does not cover all possible scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the count of 1's in `a` is either 0 or less than `n`. We can achieve this by changing the condition to `if cnt == 0 or cnt < n`.

#### Bug 4: `possible` Variable is Not Reset

The variable `possible` is not reset for each test case. This means that if a test case is determined to be possible in a previous iteration, the value of `possible` will carry over to the next iteration. This will lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to reset the value of `possible` to `True` at the start of each test case iteration. We can do this by adding the line `possible = True` at the beginning of the `for` loop.

#### Proposed Correction

Here is the corrected code:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    v = [0] * n
    possible = True

    for i in range(61):
        val = k**i
        if all((v[j] & (k-1)) == a[j] for j in range(n)):
            continue
        cnt = sum((a[j] >> i) & 1 for j in range(n))
        if cnt == 0 or cnt < n:
            continue
        possible = False
        break

    if possible:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

With these corrections, the code should now produce the expected output for the given test case.

Please note that this is just a patch to the existing code to fix the bugs mentioned. The code could be further optimized or refactored for better efficiency or readability.
