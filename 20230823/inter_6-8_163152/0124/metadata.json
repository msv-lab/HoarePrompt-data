The logic for checking if there are enough grapes for each person is incorrect. It checks if there are enough grapes to satisfy Andrew's requirement only and ignores Dmitry and Michal's requirements.\n3. The code does not handle the case where there are not enough grapes of a specific type to satisfy a person's requirement.\n4. The logic for distributing the grapes is flawed. It subtracts the required number of grapes from the total count without considering if there are enough grapes available for distribution.\n5. The condition for checking if Andrew can eat all the remaining green grapes is incorrect. It should check if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, not if `a` is greater than or equal to x.\n6. The condition for checking if Dmitry can eat all the remaining purple and green grapes is incorrect. It should check if the sum of `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to 0, not if `b + a` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nThese bugs in the code result in incorrect outputs.",
