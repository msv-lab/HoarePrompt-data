The given code attempts to calculate this value using a formula.\n\nLet's analyze the code and identify the bugs:\n\n1. The function `minimal_layers` takes an argument `N`, which represents the maximum coordinate value on the coordinate axis. However, this function is not used in the program, so it can be removed.\n\n2. The formula `int(N*(N+1)*(N+2)/6)` is used to calculate the minimal number of layers. However, this formula is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to calculate the sum of the first N+2 integers divided by 6. This formula does not provide the correct result for the given problem.\n\n3. The input is read using the `input` function, but it is not handled correctly. The input should be split into separate integers, but the code does not include any logic for splitting the input.\n\n4. The output is calculated using the incorrect formula mentioned earlier, and it is not formatted correctly. It is missing the newline character at the end.\n\nLet's now discuss the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality:\n\n1. The unused function does not affect the functionality of the program but can be removed to simplify the code.\n\n2. The incorrect formula leads to incorrect results. The minimal number of layers cannot be correctly calculated using this formula.\n\n3. The incorrect handling of the input prevents the program from correctly parsing the initial value of N.\n\n4. The incorrect output formatting does not affect the correctness of the result, but it does not adhere to the format specified in the problem statement.\n\nThese bugs result in incorrect output for the provided test case.",
