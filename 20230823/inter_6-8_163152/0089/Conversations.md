I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given an integer N. Consider all possible segments on the coordinate axis with endpoints at integer points with coordinates between 0 and N, inclusive; there will be $\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$ of them.

You want to draw these segments in several layers so that in each layer the segments don't overlap (they might touch at the endpoints though). You can not move the segments to a different location on the coordinate axis. 

Find the minimal number of layers you have to use for the given N.


-----Input-----

The only input line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer - the minimal number of layers required to draw the segments for the given N.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
2

Input
3

Output
4

Input
4

Output
6



-----Note-----

As an example, here are the segments and their optimal arrangement into layers for N = 4. [Image]
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2
" the output was "4
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The goal of this program is to calculate the minimal number of layers required to draw segments on the coordinate axis without overlapping. The given code attempts to calculate this value using a formula.

Let's analyze the code and identify the bugs:

1. The function `minimal_layers` takes an argument `N`, which represents the maximum coordinate value on the coordinate axis. However, this function is not used in the program, so it can be removed.

2. The formula `int(N*(N+1)*(N+2)/6)` is used to calculate the minimal number of layers. However, this formula is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to calculate the sum of the first N+2 integers divided by 6. This formula does not provide the correct result for the given problem.

3. The input is read using the `input` function, but it is not handled correctly. The input should be split into separate integers, but the code does not include any logic for splitting the input.

4. The output is calculated using the incorrect formula mentioned earlier, and it is not formatted correctly. It is missing the newline character at the end.

Let's now discuss the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality:

1. The unused function does not affect the functionality of the program but can be removed to simplify the code.

2. The incorrect formula leads to incorrect results. The minimal number of layers cannot be correctly calculated using this formula.

3. The incorrect handling of the input prevents the program from correctly parsing the initial value of N.

4. The incorrect output formatting does not affect the correctness of the result, but it does not adhere to the format specified in the problem statement.

These bugs result in incorrect output for the provided test case.

The calculated output of "4" does not match the expected output of "2". The formula used to calculate the minimal number of layers is incorrect, and the input handling is also incorrect. 

To fix these issues, I will implement the following changes:

1. Remove the unused function `minimal_layers`.

2. Read the input as a single integer using the `int` function.

3. Implement a correct algorithm to calculate the minimal number of layers.

4. Update the output format to adhere to the specified format.

The corrected code is as follows:
