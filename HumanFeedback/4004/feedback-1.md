1. The target is not necessarily the average of the minimum and maximum values. For example, for [2, 5], 3.5 cannot be the target. In this case, the smallest D should be 3.
2. When the target is the average of the maximum and minimum values, during the iteration process in the list, diff can be an odd number. For example: [2, 5, 8], when the target is 5, diff is 3.
3. diff is undefined outside the loop.
