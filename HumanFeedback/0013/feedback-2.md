The buggy program attempts to solve the problem by using a topological sort based on the indegree of nodes. However, the logic seems to have a flaw in terms of determining the right order for the main courses. Let's identify the problems and provide suggestions to improve it:

1. **Missing Courses Dependency Handling**:
   The main issue in the code is that when a main course is encountered, its dependent courses are not prioritized, and hence the algorithm fails to take the dependent courses first.

2. **Redundant Courses**:
   In the final order, courses which are not required to be taken (neither main courses nor dependency for the main courses) should be excluded. The current implementation is not excluding them.

Here's the feedback and suggested modifications for the buggy program:

1. **Optimized Course Dependency Handling**:
   Instead of just checking if a course is a main course and then removing it, prioritize the dependent courses to be taken before the main courses. This can be achieved by using a set to track the main courses and ensuring that their dependencies are resolved first.

2. **Filter Redundant Courses**:
   Once the order is determined, filter out any courses that are neither main courses nor dependencies of the main courses.

3. **Correct the Loop**:
   Modify the while loop to handle dependencies more effectively.
