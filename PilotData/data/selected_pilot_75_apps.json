Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.\n\nKolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).\n\nKolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a \u00d7 1 234 567 + b \u00d7 123 456 + c \u00d7 1 234 = n?\n\nPlease help Kolya answer this question.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 Kolya's initial game-coin score.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers.

Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). \n\nWrite a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200) \u2014 length of string s.\n\nThe second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n11\naaaaBaabAbA\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n12\nzACaAbbaazzC\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\nABC\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.\n\nIn the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.\n\nIn the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.",

        "description": "On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n#G#T#\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6 1\nT....G\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n7 3\nT..#..G\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n6 2\n..GT..\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.",

        "description": "On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n#G#T#\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6 1\nT....G\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n7 3\nT..#..G\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n6 2\n..GT..\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.",

This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y.

Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.\n\nPolycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 \u2264 n \u2264 45, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 45, 0 \u2264 M \u2264 2\u00b710^9).\n\nThe second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 \u2264 t_{j} \u2264 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4 11\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n5 5 10\n1 2 4 8 16\n\nOutput\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5\u00b71 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2\u00b72 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.",

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7k_{i} products.

Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it \"golden system\". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \\cdot q^{n - i}$.\n\nSoon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.\n\nGiven two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput consists of two lines \u2014 one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint \">\" if the first number is larger, \"<\" if it is smaller and \"=\" if they are equal.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1000\n111\n\nOutput\n<\n\nInput\n00100\n11\n\nOutput\n=\n\nInput\n110\n101\n\nOutput\n>\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example first number equals to $((\\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \\approx 1.618033988^{3} \\approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 \u2248 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.\n\nIn the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  \u2248 2.618.",
