        "question": "An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.\n\nFor example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. \n\nYou are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^18) — the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer — the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8 1\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.

        "question": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1s 2s 3s\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n9m 9m 9m\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3p 9m 2p\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.\n\nIn the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.\n\nIn the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p.

Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers — $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\n\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single line.\n\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\n\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\n\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\n\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\n\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\n\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.",

ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.\n\nIn Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. \n\nZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{A}{B}$.

Thus, each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and L - 1, inclusively. [Image] Consider an example.

For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.\n\nThe i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order.

He has come up with the following tournament format:   In the first several (possibly zero) stages, while the number of teams is even, they split in pairs and play one game for each pair. At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are x teams, there will be $\\frac{x \\cdot(x - 1)}{2}$ games), and the tournament ends. \n\nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for n games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly n games.

There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle.  [Image] \n\n \n\nIt's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.\n\nFlight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'.

        "question": "Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. \n\nVasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters.

Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn.

For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character \".\" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character \"w\" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters \"+\" (the \"plus\" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as \"w\". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.\n\nIf the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 8\n..w..w..\n........\n........\n..w..w..\n\nOutput\n..w++w..\n..+..+..\n..+..+..\n..w++w..\n\nInput\n5 6\n......\n.w....\n......\n..w...\n......\n\nOutput\n......\n+w+...\n+.+...\n++w...\n......\n\nInput\n2 4\n....\n.w..\n\nOutput\n....\n.w..\n\nInput\n2 6\nw..w.w\n...w..\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.",

Эдвард может выбирать, в каком направлении идти вокруг дома.\n\n\n-----Входные данные-----\n\nВ первой строке входных данных следуют три числа n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) — количество подъездов в доме, количество этажей в каждом подъезде и количество квартир на каждом этаже каждого подъезда соответственно.\n\nВо второй строке входных данных записаны два числа a и b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) — номера квартир, в которых живут Эдвард и Наташа, соответственно.

Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.\n\nВо втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.",

Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.\n\nTo get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence a has a length of n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence b, whose length k equals the number of lost elements in a (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in a with an element from b so that each element in b should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake.

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop.

        "question": "Kuro has recently won the \"Most intelligent cat ever\" contest. The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) — the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) — the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below. The scores are $3, 3, 5$ for the first row and $5, 3, 3$ for the second row, both from left to right.\n\n [Image]",

In particular, she may not apply any operation to the array at all.\n\nFormally, after applying some operations Alyona will get an array of n positive integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} such that 1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ a_{i} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Your task is to determine the maximum possible value of mex of this array.\n\nMex of an array in this problem is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in this array.

While listening to \"The White Buttons\" and their hit song \"Dacan the Baker\", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.\n\nThere are n letters in R3D3’s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter’s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence.

He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.\n\nGiven the costs c_0 and c_1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3’s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4 1 2\n\nOutput\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThere are 4 letters in the alphabet.

To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.\n\nAnton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. \n\nAnton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.\n\nAnton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.\n\nThe second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.\n\nThe third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.\n\nThe fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.\n\nThere are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.\n\nThe sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type.

The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).\n\nIn the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.",

As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.\n\nAssume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.\n\nNeko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?\n\nNote that it is not required to minimize the number of operations.

The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right).

For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'.

        "question": "It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer — as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 — the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} — the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} — the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r — the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 ≤ y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} ≤ 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2·r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).

Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.\n\nVasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.\n\nAccording to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed.

According to the definition of the implication: \n\n$0 \\rightarrow 0 = 1$ \n\n$0 \\rightarrow 1 = 1$\n\n$1 \\rightarrow 0 = 0$ \n\n$1 \\rightarrow 1 = 1$\n\nWhen a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,\n\n$0 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow 0 =(0 \\rightarrow 0) \\rightarrow 0 = 1 \\rightarrow 0 = 0$. \n\nWhen there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets.

Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n60\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n-60\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWhen the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.",

The authors have prepared $n$ problems; and since the platform is very popular, $998244351$ coder from all over the world is going to solve them.\n\nFor each problem, the authors estimated the number of people who would solve it: for the $i$-th problem, the number of accepted solutions will be between $l_i$ and $r_i$, inclusive.\n\nThe creator of ForceCoders uses different criteria to determine if the contest is good or bad. One of these criteria is the number of inversions in the problem order. An inversion is a pair of problems $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is located earlier in the contest ($x < y$), but the number of accepted solutions for $y$ is strictly greater.\n\nObviously, both the creator of ForceCoders and the authors of the contest want the contest to be good. Now they want to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, assuming that for each problem $i$, any integral number of accepted solutions for it (between $l_i$ and $r_i$) is equally probable, and all these numbers are independent.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$) — the number of problems in the contest.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 998244351$) — the minimum and maximum number of accepted solutions for the $i$-th problem, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe probability that there will be no inversions in the contest can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is coprime with $998244353$.

Monocarp is also used to TV sets with a certain aspect ratio: formally, if the width of the screen is $w$, and the height of the screen is $h$, then the following condition should be met: $\\frac{w}{h} = \\frac{x}{y}$.\n\nThere are many different TV sets in the shop. Monocarp is sure that for any pair of positive integers $w$ and $h$ there is a TV set with screen width $w$ and height $h$ in the shop.\n\nMonocarp isn't ready to choose the exact TV set he is going to buy. Firstly he wants to determine the optimal screen resolution. He has decided to try all possible variants of screen size. But he must count the number of pairs of positive integers $w$ and $h$, beforehand, such that $(w \\le a)$, $(h \\le b)$ and $(\\frac{w}{h} = \\frac{x}{y})$.\n\nIn other words, Monocarp wants to determine the number of TV sets having aspect ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$, screen width not exceeding $a$, and screen height not exceeding $b$. Two TV sets are considered different if they have different screen width or different screen height.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \\le a, b, x, y \\le 10^{18}$) — the constraints on the screen width and height, and on the aspect ratio.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer — the number of different variants to choose TV screen width and screen height so that they meet the aforementioned constraints.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n17 15 5 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n14 16 7 22\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4 2 6 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 999999866000004473 999999822000007597\n\nOutput\n1000000063\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $3$ possible variants: $(5, 3)$, $(10, 6)$, $(15, 9)$.\n\nIn the second example, there is no TV set meeting the constraints.\n\nIn the third example, there is only one variant: $(3, 2)$.",

        "question": "The number \"zero\" is called \"love\" (or \"l'oeuf\" to be precise, literally means \"egg\" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. \n\nAki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.\n\nHowever, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.\n\nGiven two integers $n$ and $b$ (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary (in the base/radix of $b$) representation of $n\\,!$ (factorial of $n$). \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$, $2 \\le b \\le 10^{12}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary representation of $n!$\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n38 11\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, $6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}$.\n\nIn the third and fourth example, $5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}$.\n\nThe representation of the number $x$ in the $b$-ary base is $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$ if $x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + \\ldots + d_k b^0$, where $d_i$ are integers and $0 \\le d_i \\le b - 1$. For example, the number $720$ from the first example is represented as $880_{(9)}$ since $720 = 8 \\cdot 9^2 + 8 \\cdot 9 + 0 \\cdot 1$.\n\nYou can read more about bases here.",

There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.\n\nThis time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). \n\nFor example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).\n\nAs we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.\n\nHelp Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$, $0 \\leq k \\leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers.

        "question": "Chouti was tired of the tedious homework, so he opened up an old programming problem he created years ago.\n\nYou are given a connected undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ weighted edges. There are $k$ special vertices: $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$.\n\nLet's define the cost of the path as the maximum weight of the edges in it. And the distance between two vertexes as the minimum cost of the paths connecting them.\n\nFor each special vertex, find another special vertex which is farthest from it (in terms of the previous paragraph, i.e. the corresponding distance is maximum possible) and output the distance between them.\n\nThe original constraints are really small so he thought the problem was boring. Now, he raises the constraints and hopes you can solve it for him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $n-1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of special vertices.\n\nThe second line contains $k$ distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$ ($1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$).\n\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ ($1 \\leq u,v \\leq n, 1 \\leq w \\leq 10^9$), denoting there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ of weight $w$. The given graph is undirected, so an edge $(u, v)$ can be used in the both directions.\n\nThe graph may have multiple edges and self-loops.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the graph is connected.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first and only line should contain $k$ integers. The $i$-th integer is the distance between $x_i$ and the farthest special vertex from it.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3 2\n2 1\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n2 2 1\n\nOutput\n2 2 \n\nInput\n4 5 3\n1 2 3\n1 2 5\n4 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 4 4\n1 3 3\n\nOutput\n3 3 3 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the distance between vertex $1$ and $2$ equals to $2$ because one can walk through the edge of weight $2$ connecting them. So the distance to the farthest node for both $1$ and $2$ equals to $2$.\n\nIn the second example, one can find that distance between $1$ and $2$, distance between $1$ and $3$ are both $3$ and the distance between $2$ and $3$ is $2$.\n\nThe graph may have multiple edges between and self-loops, as in the first example.",

Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.\n\nBomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).\n\nLet's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2.

The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y.

For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.\n\nIn the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.\n\nIn the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks.

The height of the i-th board is h_{i} centimeters.\n\nVasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited. Vasya counted the area he can paint each of the colors. It turned out that he can not paint over a square centimeters of the fence red, and he can not paint over b square centimeters green. Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.\n\nIn addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value. Vasya believes that two consecutive fence boards, painted different colors, look unattractive. The unattractiveness value of a fence is the total length of contact between the neighboring boards of various colors. To make the fence look nice, you need to minimize the value as low as possible. Your task is to find what is the minimum unattractiveness Vasya can get, if he paints his fence completely. $1$ \n\nThe picture shows the fence, where the heights of boards (from left to right) are 2,3,2,4,3,1.

        "question": "It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.\n\nToday he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Sasha wins, print \"YES\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nYou can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n10 4\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.\n\nIn the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.",

        "question": "Greg is a beginner bodybuilder. Today the gym coach gave him the training plan. All it had was n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. These numbers mean that Greg needs to do exactly n exercises today. Besides, Greg should repeat the i-th in order exercise a_{i} times.\n\nGreg now only does three types of exercises: \"chest\" exercises, \"biceps\" exercises and \"back\" exercises. Besides, his training is cyclic, that is, the first exercise he does is a \"chest\" one, the second one is \"biceps\", the third one is \"back\", the fourth one is \"chest\", the fifth one is \"biceps\", and so on to the n-th exercise.\n\nNow Greg wonders, which muscle will get the most exercise during his training. We know that the exercise Greg repeats the maximum number of times, trains the corresponding muscle the most. Help Greg, determine which muscle will get the most training.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
