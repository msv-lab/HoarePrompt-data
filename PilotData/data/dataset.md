# Data Folder README

## Overview
This folder contains various datasets used in experiments, including complete and split datasets, as well as older versions retained for reference. The datasets are primarily from the **APPS**, **MBPP**, and **Code Contests** benchmarks, with scripts generated by **GPT** and **Llama** models.

---

## Dataset Files

### **APPS Datasets**
- `apps_total_gpt.json`:  
  The complete APPS dataset with scripts generated by GPT.
- `apps_total_llama.json`:  
  The complete APPS dataset with scripts generated by Llama.

### **MBPP Datasets**
- `mbpp_total_gpt.json`:  
  The complete MBPP dataset with scripts generated by GPT.
- `mbpp_total_llama.json`:  
  The complete MBPP dataset with scripts generated by Llama.

### **Pilot Datasets**
- `pilot_apps.json`:  
  A smaller subset of the APPS dataset used for pilot experiments, containing **150 examples**:
  - 75 examples with scripts generated by GPT.
  - 75 examples with scripts generated by Llama.
- `pilot_mbpp.json`:  
  A smaller subset of the MBPP dataset used for pilot experiments, containing **150 examples**:
  - 75 examples with scripts generated by GPT.
  - 75 examples with scripts generated by Llama.

### **Code Contests Dataset**
- `code_contests_first1000.json`:  
  Contains the first **1000 examples** of the **Code Contests** dataset.

## Subfolders

### **Exhaustive**
Contains the **APPS** and **MBPP** datasets split into smaller subsets for more targeted analysis.

### **Old Datasets**
A collection of outdated versions of the datasets that were used in earlier experiments. These are retained for reference and historical comparison.

## Notes
- All datasets are in JSON format.
- Ensure proper file paths are set when running scripts to process these datasets.
- If working with split datasets, refer to the `exhaustive` folder for smaller, manageable files.
- Use datasets from the `old_datasets` folder only for reproducing older experiments or comparisons, as they may not reflect the latest updates.
