The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.\n\nFor example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^18)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.",

Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \u2014 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \u2014 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \u2014 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings\u00a0\u2014 the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.

And how can one perform well with such a major loss?\n\nFortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!\n\nThe storehouse is represented as matrix n \u00d7 m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.\n\nSofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. \n\nNote that in all conditions A \u2260 B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.\n\nThe note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} \u2014 to the right, cnt_{t} \u2014 to the top and cnt_{b} \u2014 to the bottom.\n\nGrandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.\n\nOutput the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of sofas in the storehouse.\n\nThe second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the size of the storehouse.\n\nNext d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1, x_2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_1, y_2 \u2264 m) \u2014 coordinates of the i-th sofa.

The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. \n\nSo the second one corresponds to the given conditions.\n\nIn the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. \n\nAnd there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.",

You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \\le cnt_i \\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1\n4\n3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example it is possible to construct a string \"(())()(()((()()()())))\", which is a regular bracket sequence.\n\nIn the second example it is possible to construct a string \"\", which is a regular bracket sequence.",

        "description": "Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\n\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single line.\n\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\n\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\n\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\n\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\n\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\n\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.",

At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends.

        "description": "Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. \n\nVasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ \u2014 the number of operations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of operations \u2014 a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.\n\nThe third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9)$ \u2014 the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\nRURUU\n-2 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\nRULR\n1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\nUUU\n100 100\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nIn the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.\n\nIn the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.",

If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...\n\nThe order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.\n\nDuring the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above.

Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively.

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.\n\nVisitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.\n\nYou are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines.

The first bar is a_1 \u00d7 b_1 segments large and the second one is a_2 \u00d7 b_2 segments large.\n\nPolycarpus wants to give Paraskevi one of the bars at the lunch break and eat the other one himself. Besides, he wants to show that Polycarpus's mind and Paraskevi's beauty are equally matched, so the two bars must have the same number of squares.\n\nTo make the bars have the same number of squares, Polycarpus eats a little piece of chocolate each minute. Each minute he does the following:  he either breaks one bar exactly in half (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a half of the bar,  or he chips of exactly one third of a bar (vertically or horizontally) and eats exactly a third of the bar. \n\nIn the first case he is left with a half, of the bar and in the second case he is left with two thirds of the bar.\n\nBoth variants aren't always possible, and sometimes Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third. For example, if the bar is 16 \u00d7 23, then Polycarpus can chip off a half, but not a third. If the bar is 20 \u00d7 18, then Polycarpus can chip off both a half and a third. If the bar is 5 \u00d7 7, then Polycarpus cannot chip off a half nor a third.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of minutes Polycarpus needs to make two bars consist of the same number of squares? Find not only the required minimum number of minutes, but also the possible sizes of the bars after the process.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers a_1, b_1 (1 \u2264 a_1, b_1 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the initial sizes of the first chocolate bar. The second line of the input contains integers a_2, b_2 (1 \u2264 a_2, b_2 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the initial sizes of the second bar.\n\nYou can use the data of type int64 (in Pascal), long long (in \u0421++), long (in Java) to process large integers (exceeding 2^31 - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print m \u2014 the sought minimum number of minutes. In the second and third line print the possible sizes of the bars after they are leveled in m minutes. Print the sizes using the format identical to the input format.

Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as \"the game is good for the imagination and attention\".\n\nHelp Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. \n\nFormally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each \u2014 the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character \".\" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character \"w\" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters \"+\" (the \"plus\" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as \"w\". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.\n\nIf the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 8\n..w..w..\n........\n........\n..w..w..\n\nOutput\n..w++w..\n..+..+..\n..+..+..\n..w++w..\n\nInput\n5 6\n......\n.w....\n......\n..w...\n......\n\nOutput\n......\n+w+...\n+.+...\n++w...\n......\n\nInput\n2 4\n....\n.w..\n\nOutput\n....\n.w..\n\nInput\n2 6\nw..w.w\n...w..\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.",

Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from $1$ to $N^2$ and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The $j$-th square in the $i$-th row has a number $A_{ij}$ written on it.\n\nIn your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number $1$ (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square $2$ (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square $3$ and so on until you reach square $N^2$. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.\n\nA knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.\n\nYou want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal.

If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.\n\nUnfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)\u00b7(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 min(n, m), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 min(n\u00b7m, 10^5)).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single number\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.\n\nYou answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.

She told him, that array would not be spoiled after the following operation: choose any index $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and do $a_i := -a_i - 1$.\n\nFor example, he can change array $[3, -1, -4, 1]$ to an array $[-4, -1, 3, 1]$ after applying this operation to elements with indices $i=1$ and $i=3$. \n\nKolya had immediately understood that sometimes it's possible to increase the product of integers of the array a lot. Now he has decided that he wants to get an array with the maximal possible product of integers using only this operation with its elements (possibly zero, one or more times, as many as he wants), it is not forbidden to do this operation several times for the same index. \n\nHelp Kolya and print the array with the maximal possible product of elements $a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\dots a_n$ which can be received using only this operation in some order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 number of integers in the array.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^{6} \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{6}$)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the array\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n$ numbers\u00a0\u2014 elements of the array with the maximal possible product of elements which can be received using only this operation in some order from the given array.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 2 2 2\n\nOutput\n-3 -3 -3 -3 \nInput\n1\n0\n\nOutput\n0 \nInput\n3\n-3 -3 2\n\nOutput\n-3 -3 2",

Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence a has a length of n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence b, whose length k equals the number of lost elements in a (i.e. the number of zeros).

Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity.

        "description": "Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and f (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 f \u2264 n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.\n\nEach line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 \u2264 k_{i}, l_{i} \u2264 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2\n2 1\n3 5\n2 3\n1 5\n\nOutput\n10\nInput\n4 1\n0 2\n0 3\n3 5\n0 6\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second\u00a0\u2014 5, on the third\u00a0\u2014 2, on the fourth\u00a0\u2014 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.\n\nIn the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.",

        "description": "Kuro has recently won the \"Most intelligent cat ever\" contest. The three friends then decided to go to Katie's home to celebrate Kuro's winning. After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n-1 0 1\n\nOutput\n6\nInput\n2 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n1 1\n-1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below. The scores are $3, 3, 5$ for the first row and $5, 3, 3$ for the second row, both from left to right.\n\n [Image]",

We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).\n\nTo modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.\n\nHe decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \\leq k \\leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \\cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \\leq c \\leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).\n\nFor example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.\n\nAfter closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$).

While listening to \"The White Buttons\" and their hit song \"Dacan the Baker\", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.\n\nThere are n letters in R3D3\u2019s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter\u2019s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet\u2019s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.\n\nGiven the costs c_0 and c_1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3\u2019s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 \u2264 c_0, c_1 \u2264 10^8)\u00a0\u2014 the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4 1 2\n\nOutput\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThere are 4 letters in the alphabet.

For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on.

        "description": "On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'.

Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input.

        "description": "It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them.

However, he found this statement untrue, because there certainly exist unsorted arrays for which the algorithm find $x$!\n\nAndrey wants to write a letter to the book authors, but before doing that he must consider the permutations of size $n$ such that the algorithm finds $x$ in them. A permutation of size $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ in arbitrary order.\n\nHelp Andrey and find the number of permutations of size $n$ which contain $x$ at position $pos$ and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds $x$ (returns true).

Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.\n\nAndrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.\n\nFor example, consider the following string:  [Image] \n\nThis string can encode the message \u00abhappynewyear\u00bb.

        "description": "Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.\n\nOne of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18) \u2014 camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative \u2014 counter-clockwise.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n60\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n-60\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWhen the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.",

Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.\n\nIn the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.\n\nIn the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards \u2014 for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.",

If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled.

Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.\n\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\n\nThere is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank.

For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). \n\nFor example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).\n\nAs we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions.

First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.\n\nAll of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput will begin with an integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 50), the number of slices of pie. \n\nFollowing this is a line with N integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n141 592 653\n\nOutput\n653 733\n\nInput\n5\n10 21 10 21 10\n\nOutput\n31 41\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself.",

Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! \n\nHowever, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y.

Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one \u2014 during x_2-th second, and the third one \u2014 during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.\n\nHelp Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 \u2264 k_{i} \u2264 1500) \u2014 time intervals of the garlands.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.\n\nOtherwise, print NO.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n4 2 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second \u2014 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.\n\nIn the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.",

When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes).

All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. \n\nOne of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i_1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{k}, if i_2 - i_1 = i_3 - i_2 = ... = i_{k} - i_{k} - 1. Of course, all segments i_1, i_2, ... i_{k} should be exactly the platforms, not pits. \n\nLet's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i_1, i_2, ..., i_5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length.

These numbers mean that Greg needs to do exactly n exercises today. Besides, Greg should repeat the i-th in order exercise a_{i} times.\n\nGreg now only does three types of exercises: \"chest\" exercises, \"biceps\" exercises and \"back\" exercises. Besides, his training is cyclic, that is, the first exercise he does is a \"chest\" one, the second one is \"biceps\", the third one is \"back\", the fourth one is \"chest\", the fifth one is \"biceps\", and so on to the n-th exercise.\n\nNow Greg wonders, which muscle will get the most exercise during his training.

Today, a professor told his students that the grades for his course would be given out automatically \u00a0\u2014 he would calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of the student\u00a0\u2014 $4.5$ would be rounded up to $5$ (as in example 3), but $4.4$ would be rounded down to $4$.\n\nThis does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse than $5$ (maybe even the dreaded $2$). However, the professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's choosing to increase his average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible in order to get $5$ for the course. Of course, Vasya will get $5$ for the lab works he chooses to redo.\n\nHelp Vasya\u00a0\u2014 calculate the minimum amount of lab works Vasya has to redo.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$\u00a0\u2014 the number of Vasya's grades ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers from $2$ to $5$\u00a0\u2014 Vasya's grades for his lab works.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum amount of lab works that Vasya has to redo.
