Each resident\nwants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is\ndescribed as a sequence a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident\nof the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,\na_j = 1 .\n\nThe road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be\ndeclared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the\nright-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then\nthe houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the\nstreet, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road\nalso may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the\nentire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.\n\nTo make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half\nof the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.\nThat is, among x residents on one side, at least \\lceil\\frac{x}{2}\\rceil\nshould want to live on that side, where \\lceil x \\rceil denotes rounding up a\nreal number x .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)\nTo the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j\nthere must be at least \\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\rceil zeros. To the right of the\nroad, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at\nleast \\lceil\\frac{n-i}{2}\\rceil ones.\n\nDetermine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the\ndescribed condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.\nFormally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \\left|\\frac{n}{2} -\ni\\right| .\n\nIf there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \\left|\\frac{n}{2}\n- i\\right| , output the smaller one.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be\nsatisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after\nhouse 1 .\n\nIf we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left\nside (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the\nright side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice.

In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n, a_{1} = 0 .\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 1 3 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    1 1\n    2 1\n    4 1\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

        "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nYou are given a grid with n rows and m columns. The coordinates (x, y)\nrepresent the cell on the grid, where x (1 \\leq x \\leq n ) is the row number\ncounting from the top and y (1 \\leq y \\leq m ) is the column number counting\nfrom the left. It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 mines in the grid at\ndistinct cells, denoted as (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) . You are allowed to make\nno more than 4 queries to the interactor, and after these queries, you need to\nprovide the location of one of the mines.\n\nIn each query, you can choose any grid cell (x, y) , and in return, you will\nreceive the minimum Manhattan distance from both the mines to the chosen cell,\ni.e., you will receive the value \\min(|x-x_1|+|y-y_1|, |x-x_2|+|y-y_2|) .\n\nYour task is to determine the location of one of the mines after making the\nqueries.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a\nsingle integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{3} ) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 \\leq n \\leq\n10^{8} , 2 \\leq m \\leq 10^{8} ) \u2014 the number of rows and columns.\n\nInteraction\n\nFor each test case, the interaction starts with reading n and m .\n\nThen you are allowed to make at most 4 queries in the following way:\n\n\"? x y\" (1 \\leq x \\leq n and 1 \\leq y \\leq m )\n\nAfter each one, you should read an integer d which is equal to\n\\min(|x-x_1|+|y-y_1|, |x-x_2|+|y-y_2|) .\n\nWhen you have found the location of any one of the mines, print a single line\n\"! x y\" (without quotes), representing the row and the column of one of the\nmines. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nAfter printing the answer, your program must then continue to solve the\nremaining test cases, or exit if all test cases have been solved.\n\nThe interactor for this problem is not adaptive: cells of mines are fixed\nbefore any queries are made.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see the documentation for other languages. \n\nHacks:\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{3} ) \u2014\nthe number of test cases.\n\nThe description of each test case should consist of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{8} , 2 \\leq m\n\\leq 10^{8} ) \u2014 the number of rows and columns.\n\nThe second line contains the coordinates of the first mine x_1 and y_1 (1 \\leq\nx_1 \\leq n , 1 \\leq y_1 \\leq m ).\n\nThe third line contains the coordinates of the second mine x_2 and y_2 (1 \\leq\nx_2 \\leq n , 1 \\leq y_2 \\leq m ).\n\nThe mines should be located at different positions.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    2\n    4 4\n    \n    3\n    \n    2\n    \n    2\n    \n    0\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    1\n    \n    2\n    \n    3\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 1 1\n    \n    ? 1 4\n    \n    ? 4 1\n    \n    ? 2 3\n    \n    ! 2 3\n    \n    ? 5 5\n    \n    ? 2 2\n    \n    ? 3 3\n    \n    ! 1 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, we start by querying the upper-left corner (1, 1) and\nget the result 3 , which means that there is a mine on the counter diagonal,\nand there is no mine above it.\n\nIn the image below, each cell contains a number indicating the distance to the\nblue cell. The green cells are candidates to contain the nearest mine.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d7550b3a7833b6bf1bda7128868278104d358809.png)\n\nThen we ask three cells on that diagonal, and at the last query, we get the\nresult 0 , which means that a mine is found at the position (2, 3) .\n\nThe second mine was located at the position (3, 2) .\n\nIn the second test case, we start by asking the lower-right corner (5, 5) ,\nand get the result 1 , which means that one of the two neighbours contains a\nmine, let's call it mine 1 .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/02e28fb3301e94dcf02f896272409793bca48022.png)\n\nThen we ask cell (2, 2) . We can see that these green cells don't intersect\nwith the green cells from the first query, so they contain the other mine,\nlet's call it mine 2 .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/7b5a8f68d0a5bcd1d2de93271789888d5e3e6289.png)\n\nQuery 3 is cell (3, 3) . These cells contain mine 1 , but we still don't know\nwhere exactly.

Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \\mid p_b) and y = (p_c \\mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

The\ninteractor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is\nfixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.\n\nTo ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d\n< n ) and print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"? a b c d\" \n\nAfter that, you receive:\n\n  * \"<\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) < (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \"=\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) = (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \">\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) > (p_c \\mid p_d) . \n\nYou can make at most 3n queries of this form.\n\nNext, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \\le i, j < n )\nsuch that p_i \\oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"! i j\" \n\nNote that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account\nwhen counting the number of queries asked.\n\nAfter this, proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must\nterminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output\nthe end of line and flush the output.

The tournament\nconsists of n-1 matches as follows:\n\n  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . \n  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . \n  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. \n\nYou are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;\nrather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an\nacquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the\nposition of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do\nnothing.\n\nFind the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \\le n \\le\n10^5, 1 \\le k \\le n ) \u2014 the number of cows and your cow's index.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1\n\\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the Cowdeforces rating of the cows.

To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \\le i \\le\nm , 1 \\le j \\le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,\nhe obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted\ninto the array a ).\n\nTo determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the\nproblems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i\n> 1 ).\n\nWhat is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at\nmost one problem, created according to the described rules?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of prepared problems,\nthe number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots a_n\n(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) \u2014 the complexities of the\nprepared problems.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots d_m\n(1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the models.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dots f_k\n(1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the functions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single number \u2014 the minimum imbalance that Rudolf\ncan achieve.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    5 5 5\n    \n    5 10 15 20 26\n    \n    11 14 16 13 8\n    \n    16 4 5 3 1\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 9 3 2\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 13 3 2\n    \n    5 6 3\n    \n    2 10 13 20 25\n    \n    11 6 10 16 14 5\n    \n    6 17 15\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    11 12 14 15\n    \n    19 14\n    \n    10 6\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30\n    \n    9 13 16 15\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 4 7\n    \n    4 21\n    \n    4 15 14 5\n    \n    20 1 15 1 12 5 11\n\nOutput\n\n    5\n    4\n    5\n    8\n    2\n    7\n    11",

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

He takes it, goes to the goal of the red team, and\nlets the ball there. He scores! The ball gets back to the middle of the field,\na red player takes it and scores too.\n\nIn the second example, the red player takes the Quaffle, move it and throw it.\nThe blue player catches the ball, goes to the red goal and scores.\n\nIn the third example, the red player takes the ball and scores in the goal of\ntheir own team: the blue team wins a point.",

At the start of the game, all cards are\nin the randomly shuffled deck.\n\nBessie starts the game by drawing the top 5 cards of the deck. She may then\nplay \"draw x \" cards from the hand to draw the next x cards from the top of\nthe deck. Note that every card can only be played once, special cards cannot\nbe played, and if Bessie uses a \"draw 2 \" card when there is only 1 card\nremaining in the deck, then she simply draws that remaining card. Bessie wins\nif she draws all 5 special cards.\n\nSince Bessie is not very good at math problems, she wants you to find the\nprobability that she wins, given that the deck is shuffled randomly over all\n(a + b + c + 5)! possible orderings. It can be shown that this answer can\nalways be expressed as a fraction \\frac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime\nintegers.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum\nstrength from the mushrooms.\n\nThe strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms\nin it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength.

        "description": "The world is a grid with n rows and m columns. The rows are numbered 0, 1,\n\\ldots, n-1 , while the columns are numbered 0, 1, \\ldots, m-1 . In this\nworld, the columns are cyclic (i.e. the top and the bottom cells in each\ncolumn are adjacent). The cell on the i -th row and the j -th column (0 \\le i\n< n, 0 \\le j < m ) is denoted as (i,j) .\n\nAt time 0 , the cell (i,j) (where 0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m ) contains either a\nrock or nothing. The state of cell (i,j) can be described using the integer\na_{i,j} :\n\n  * If a_{i,j} = 1 , there is a rock at (i,j) . \n  * If a_{i,j} = 0 , there is nothing at (i,j) . \n\nAs a result of aftershocks from the earthquake, the columns follow tectonic\nplate movements: each column moves cyclically upwards at a velocity of 1 cell\nper unit of time. Formally, for some 0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m , if (i,j)\ncontains a rock at the moment, it will move from (i, j) to (i - 1, j) (or to\n(n - 1, j) if i=0 ).\n\nThe robot called RT is initially positioned at (0,0) . It has to go to\n(n-1,m-1) to carry out an earthquake rescue operation (to the bottom rightmost\ncell). The earthquake doesn't change the position of the robot, they only\nchange the position of rocks in the world.\n\nLet RT's current position be (x,y) (0 \\le x < n, 0 \\le y < m ), it can perform\nthe following operations:\n\n  * Go one cell cyclically upwards, i.e. from (x,y) to ((x+n-1) \\bmod n, y) using 1 unit of time. \n  * Go one cell cyclically downwards, i.e. (x,y) to ((x+1) \\bmod n, y) using 1 unit of time. \n  * Go one cell to the right, i.e. (x,y) to (x, y+1) using 1 unit of time. (RT may perform this operation only if y < m-1 .) \n\nNote that RT cannot go left using the operations nor can he stay at a\nposition.\n\nUnfortunately, RT will explode upon colliding with a rock. As such, when RT is\nat (x,y) and there is a rock at ((x+1) \\bmod n, y) or ((x+2) \\bmod n, y) , RT\ncannot move down or it will be hit by the rock.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/54b91480f21e9db9b3082078e8c3f561bbc98d16.png)\n\nSimilarly, if y+1 < m and there is a rock at ((x+1) \\bmod n, y+1) , RT cannot\nmove right or it will be hit by the rock.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/fc36b41ba5b0aaf6e7cb0cd14e3d7753ff8ce551.png)\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that if there is a rock at (x \\bmod n, y+1) and\n((x+1) \\bmod n, y) , RT can still move right safely.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/aea04e7014e8732ae282cc6fc1cc10e0bcf293db.png)\n\nFind the minimum amount of time RT needs to reach (n-1,m-1) without colliding\nwith any rocks.

The (j+1) -th integer on the\n(i+1) -th line (0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m ) is a_{i,j} (0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 1 ),\nwhich denotes whether or not there is a rock at (i,j) at time 0 .\n\nAdditionally, it is guaranteed that a_{0,0} = 0 , and a_{i, m-1} = 0 for 0 \\le\ni < n . In other words, there is no rock at RT's initial position as well as\ncolumn m-1 .\n\nThe sum of n \\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case:\n\n  * If the destination can be reached without colliding with any rocks, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum amount of time RT needs to reach (n-1,m-1) . \n  * Otherwise, output -1 . \n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    0 1 0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0\n    \n    1 0 1 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    3 7\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    0 1 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0 1 0\n\nOutput\n\n    7\n    3\n    3\n    8\n    -1\n    12\n    \nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    3\n    -1\n    -1\n    3\n    8\n    \nNote\n\nVisual explanation of the first test case in the example:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/637212bb29cbbd910ef8e78f64b0fc4890aa4872.png)",

        "description": "This is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only\nby the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values\nare non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n\n\\times m (2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9 ), the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to\nbottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell\nat the intersection of row r and column c is denoted as (r, c ).\n\nBob has k (2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) fountains, all of them are located in\ndifferent cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but\nshe must meet several conditions:\n\n  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. \n  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts \u2014 one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part \u2014 to Bob. \n  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). \n  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). \n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as\npossible.\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them\nto Alice. First, output the integer \\alpha \u2014 the maximum possible size of\nAlice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will\nremain on Bob's plot). Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots,\na_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to \\alpha ); \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than \\alpha ). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn, m \\le 10^9 , 2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the field sizes and the number of\nfountains, respectively.\n\nThen follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n\n, 1 \\le c_i \\le m ) \u2014 the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It\nis guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output \\alpha \u2014 the maximum size of the plot that\ncan belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output\nk non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob; \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob. \n\nIf you output any other positive number instead of 1 that fits into a 64-bit\nsigned integer type, it will also be recognized as 1 .

However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert\norganizers have implemented the following measures:\n\n  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. \n  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . \n\nFor example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they\nwill cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,\n7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an\nadditional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .\n\nFind the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \\le\nn \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le m \\le 10^9, 1 \\le k \\le \\min(nm, 10^9) ) \u2014 the\nnumber of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and\nthe number of tickets to be bought at the end.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1\n\\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to\npurchase exactly k tickets.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    \n    4 2 3\n    \n    8 6 4 2\n    \n    4 2 8\n    \n    8 6 4 2\n    \n    5 100 1\n    \n    10000 1 100 10 1000\n    \n    6 3 9\n    \n    5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nOutput\n\n    10\n    64\n    1\n    72\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:\n\n  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . \n  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . \n  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . \n  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . \n\nIn the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:\n\n  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . \n  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . \n  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . \n  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .",

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  \nCharacter| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  \n  \nThe last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case\n\"()(()())\". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced\nshuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle\nof the input sequence.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced\nparentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will\nomit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of\ntwo different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore\nthe balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced\nparentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).\n\nYou are given a balanced parentheses sequence.

When Nene uses this spell, the following actions\nhappen in the following order one by one:\n\n  * The 1 -st monster attacks the 2 -nd monster; \n  * The 2 -nd monster attacks the 3 -rd monster; \n  * \\ldots \n  * The (n-1) -th monster attacks the n -th monster; \n  * The n -th monster attacks the 1 -st monster. \n\nWhen the monster with energy level x attacks the monster with the energy level\ny , the energy level of the defending monster becomes \\max(0, y-x) (the energy\nlevel of the attacking monster remains equal to x ).\n\nNene is going to use this spell 10^{100} times and deal with the monsters that\nwill still have a non-zero energy level herself. She wants you to determine\nwhich monsters will have a non-zero energy level once she will use the\ndescribed spell 10^{100} times.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the\nnumber of monsters.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (0 \\le a_i \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the current energy levels of monsters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case,\n\n  * in the first line output an integer m \u2014 the number of monsters with non-zero energy level after 10^{100} uses of the spell; \n  * in the second line of output m integers i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_m (1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_m \\le n ) \u2014 the indices of these monsters in the increasing order. \n\nIf m=0 , you may either output an empty line or don't output it.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    3\n    \n    2 5 3\n    \n    2\n    \n    0 0\n    \n    4\n    \n    1 5 7 2\n    \n    4\n    \n    4 2 1 2\n    \n    13\n    \n    1 1 4 5 1 4 1 9 1 9 8 1 0\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    1 \n    0\n    \n    1\n    1 \n    2\n    1 3 \n    6\n    1 3 6 8 10 12 \n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the following actions happen during the first 3 uses\nof the spell in this order:\n\n  * Nene uses the Attack Your Neighbour spell for the first time; \n  * the 1 -st monster attacks the 2 -nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 2 -nd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 5-2)=3 ; \n  * the 2 -nd monster attacks the 3 -rd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 3 -rd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 3-3)=0 ; \n  * the 3 -rd monster attacks the 1 -st monster, after the attack the energy level of the 1 -st monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 2-0)=2 ; \n  * Nene uses the Attack Your Neighbour spell for the second time; \n  * the 1 -st monster attacks the 2 -nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 2 -nd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 3-2)=1 ; \n  * the 2 -nd monster attacks the 3 -rd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 3 -rd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 0-1)=0 ; \n  * the 3 -rd monster attacks the 1 -st monster, after the attack the energy level of the 1 -st monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 2-0)=2 ; \n  * Nene uses the Attack Your Neighbour spell for the third time; \n  * the 1 -st monster attacks the 2 -nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 2 -nd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 1-2)=0 ; \n  * the 2 -nd monster attacks the 3 -rd monster, after the attack the energy level of the 3 -rd monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 0-0)=0 ; \n  * the 3 -rd monster attacks the 1 -st monster, after the attack the energy level of the 1 -st monster becomes equal to \\max(0, 2-0)=2 . \n\nAfter each of the next uses of the spell, energy levels of monsters do not\nchange. Thus, only the 1 -st monster has a non-zero energy level in the end.\n\nIn the second test case, both monsters initially have zero energy level.",

        "description": "This is an interactive problem!\n\nMr. 1048576 is one of those faculty who hates wasting his time in taking class\nattendance. Instead of taking attendance the old-fashioned way, he decided to\ntry out something new today.\n\nThere are n students in his class, having roll numbers 1 to n . He knows that\nexactly 1 student is absent today. In order to determine who is absent, he can\nask some queries to the class. In each query, he can provide two integers l\nand r (1\\leq l\\leq r\\leq n ) and all students whose roll numbers are between l\nand r (inclusive) will raise their hands. He then counts them to determine if\nthe roll number of the absent student lies between these values.\n\nThings seemed fine until his teaching assistant noticed something \u2014 the\nstudents are dishonest! Some students whose roll numbers lie in the given\nrange may not raise their hands, while some other students whose roll number\ndoes not lie in the given range may raise their hands. But the students don't\nwant to raise much suspicion. So, only the following 4 cases are possible for\na particular query (l,r) \u2014\n\n  1. True Positive: r-l+1 students are present and r-l+1 students raised their hands. \n  2. True Negative: r-l students are present and r-l students raised their hands. \n  3. False Positive: r-l students are present but r-l+1 students raised their hands. \n  4. False Negative: r-l+1 students are present but r-l students raised their hands. \n\nIn the first two cases, the students are said to be answering honestly, while\nin the last two cases, the students are said to be answering dishonestly. The\nstudents can mutually decide upon their strategy, not known to Mr. 1048576.\nAlso, the students do not want to raise any suspicion and at the same time,\nwant to create a lot of confusion. So, their strategy always meets the\nfollowing two conditions \u2014\n\n  1. The students will never answer honestly 3 times in a row. \n  2. The students will never answer dishonestly 3 times in a row. \n\nMr. 1048576 is frustrated by this act of students. So, he is willing to mark\nat most 2 students as absent (though he knows that only one is). The\nattendance is said to be successful if the student who is actually absent is\namong those two. Also, due to limited class time, he can only ask up to\n\\lceil\\log_{1.116}{n}\\rceil-1 queries (weird numbers but okay). Help him\ncomplete a successful attendance.\n\nInteraction\n\nFirst read a line containing a single integer t (1\\leq t\\leq 2048 ) denoting\nthe number of independent test cases that you must solve.\n\nFor each test case, first read a line containing a single integer n (3\\leq\nn\\leq 10^5 ). Then you may ask up to \\lceil\\log_{1.116}{n}\\rceil-1 queries.\n\nTo ask a query, print a single line in the format \"? l r\" (without quotes)\n(1\\leq l\\leq r\\leq n) . Then read a single line containing a single integer x\n(r-l\\leq x\\leq r-l+1 ) denoting the number of students who raised their hands\ncorresponding to the query.\n\nTo mark a student as absent, print a single line in the format \"! a\" (without\nquotes) (1\\leq a\\leq n) . Then read a single integer y (y\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\} ). If\nthe student with roll number a was absent, y=1 , else, y=0 . Note that this\noperation does not count as a query but you can do this operation at most 2\ntimes.\n\nTo end a test case, print a single line in the format \"#\" (without quotes).\nThen you must continue solving the remaining test cases.\n\nIf you ask more queries than allowed or ask an invalid query, you will get the\nWrong answer verdict.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nAfter printing the answers, do not forget to output end of line and flush the\noutput buffer. Otherwise, you will get the verdict Idleness limit exceeded. To\nflush the buffer, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * Read documentation for other languages. \n\nNote that the grader for this problem is adaptive meaning that the answer may\nchange depending on your queries but will always remain consistent with the\nconstraints and the answer to the previous queries.\n\nInput format for Hacks\n\nThe test cases for this problem use both non-adaptive and adaptive graders.\nYou can use the non-adaptive grader for making hacks.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1\\leq t\\leq 2048 ).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers g , n and x where g=1\n(to identify that this test case must use the non-adaptive grader), n (3\\leq\nn\\leq 10^5 ) represents the number of students in the class and x (1\\leq x\\leq\nn ) represents the roll number of the student who is absent. You must ensure\nthat the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string S (1\\leq\\vert\nS\\vert\\leq 120, S_i\\in \\\\{\\texttt{T},\\texttt{F}\\\\} ). This string represents\nthe pattern of the truth sequence. If S_{(i-1)\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1}=\n\\texttt{T} , the students will act honestly during the i -th query, otherwise\nthey will act dishonestly. You must also ensure that there is no index i such\nthat S_{(i-1)\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1} = S_{i\\bmod \\vert S\\vert+1} = S_{(i+1)\\bmod\n\\vert S\\vert+1} .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    5\n    \n    3\n    \n    2\n    \n    1\n    \n    2\n    \n    0\n    \n    1\n    \n    0\n    \n    2\n    \n    0\n    \n    1\n    \n    6\n    \n    6\n    \n    2\n    \n    2\n    \n    0\n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    0\n    \n    0\n    \n    0\n    \n    1\n    \nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    ? 1 4\n    \n    ? 3 5\n    \n    ? 2 2\n    \n    ? 1 3\n    \n    ? 3 3\n    \n    ? 3 3\n    \n    ! 3\n    \n    ? 2 4\n    \n    ? 4 4\n    \n    ! 2\n    \n    #\n    \n    ? 1 6\n    \n    ? 1 3\n    \n    ? 4 6\n    \n    ? 1 1\n    \n    ? 3 3\n    \n    ? 5 5\n    \n    ! 3\n    \n    ? 2 2\n    \n    ? 4 4\n    \n    ! 4\n    \n    #\n    \nNote\n\nFor the first test case, the student with roll number 2 is absent and the\ntruth sequence (see section for hacks) is TFFTFTTF.

        "description": "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value\nof n .\n\nProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position.

This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced\nshuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle\nof the input sequence.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced\nparentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will\nomit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of\ntwo different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore\nthe balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced\nparentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).\n\nYou are given a balanced parentheses sequence.

Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \\mid p_b) and y = (p_c \\mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

        "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two\nversions of this problem is the constraint on k . You can make hacks only if\nall versions of the problem are solved.\n\nYou are given an undirected tree of n nodes. Each node v has a value a_v\nwritten on it. You have to answer queries related to the tree.\n\nYou are given q queries. In each query, you are given 5 integers, u_1, v_1,\nu_2, v_2, k . Denote the count of nodes with value c on path u_1 \\rightarrow\nv_1 with x_c , and the count of nodes with value c on path u_2 \\rightarrow v_2\nwith y_c . If there are z such values of c such that x_c \\neq y_c , output any\n\\min(z, k) such values in any order.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of\nnodes in the tree.\n\nThe next line contains n integers, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5\n) \u2014 the value written on each node of the tree.\n\nThen n - 1 lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v (1 \\leq u, v\n\\leq n, u \\neq v ) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the\ngiven edges form a tree.\n\nThe next line contains one integer q (1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of\nqueries.\n\nThen q lines follow. Each line contains five integers u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, k (1\n\\leq u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2 \\leq n , k = 1 ).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output on a separate line. For a query, first output \\min(z,\nk) and then on the same line, output any \\min(z, k) values in any order which\noccur a different number of times in each path.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    5 2 3 4 3\n    1 2\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    2 5\n    3\n    1 4 4 5 1\n    2 3 2 3 1\n    5 5 4 3 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    1 5\n    0\n    1 2\n\nNote\n\nFor query 1 , the first path is 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 , coming across\nthe multiset of values \\\\{5, 2, 4\\\\} . On the second path 4 \\rightarrow 2\n\\rightarrow 5 , we have the multiset \\\\{4, 2, 3\\\\} . Two numbers \u2014 3 and 5\noccur a different number of times, hence we print one of them.\n\nIn query 2 , there is no difference between the paths, hence we output 0 .\n\nIn query 3 , the first path is just the node 5 , resulting in the multiset\n\\\\{3\\\\} , and the second path 4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3\ngives \\\\{4, 2, 5, 3\\\\} .

He asked Kirill\nif he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.\n\nYou are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be\nfound. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers\nfrom 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but\n[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is\nalso not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nYou decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced\nalgorithm for the search \u2014 binary search. However, you forgot that for binary\nsearch, the array must be sorted.\n\nYou did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order\nto get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more\nthan 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\\le i, j\n\\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .\n\nAfter that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,\ntwo variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is\nexecuted:\n\n  1.

Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard.

Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n.

To do this, he needs to give her an engagement ring.\nHowever, his girlfriend does not like such romantic gestures, but she does\nlike binary search trees^{\\dagger} . So Sasha decided to give her such a tree.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time on wedding websites for programmers, he found the\nperfect binary search tree with the root at vertex 1 . In this tree, the value\nat vertex v is equal to val_v .\n\nBut after some time, he forgot the values in some vertices. Trying to remember\nthe found tree, Sasha wondered \u2014 how many binary search trees could he have\nfound on the website, if it is known that the values in all vertices are\nintegers in the segment [1, C] . Since this number can be very large, output\nit modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\n^{\\dagger} A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree in which for any\nvertex x , the following property holds: the values of all vertices in the\nleft subtree of vertex x (if it exists) are less than or equal to the value at\nvertex x , and the values of all vertices in the right subtree of vertex x (if\nit exists) are greater than or equal to the value at vertex x .\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and C (2 \\leq n \\leq\n5 \\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\leq C \\leq 10^9 ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and\nthe maximum allowed value at the vertex.\n\nThe next n lines describe the vertices of the tree. The i -th line contains\nthree integers L_i, R_i and val_i (-1 \\le L_i, R_i \\le n , -1 \\le val_i \\le C\n, L_i, R_i, val_i \\ne 0 ) \u2014 the number of the left child, the number of the\nright child, and the value at the i -th vertex, respectively. If L_i = -1 ,\nthen the i -th vertex has no left son. If R_i = -1 , then the i -th vertex has\nno right son. If val_i = -1 , then the value at the i -th vertex is unknown.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one suitable binary search tree exists.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the number of suitable binary\nsearch trees modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    2 3 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 2\n    \n    4 -1 3\n    \n    -1 5 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n    \n    3 69\n    \n    2 3 47\n    \n    -1 -1 13\n    \n    -1 -1 69\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 3 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n\nOutput\n\n    4\n    1\n    10\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the binary search tree has the following form:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/602b54b45d686037e402a803f6366451493d4f00.png)\n\nThen the possible values at the vertices are: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2] , [2, 2, 3, 2,\n3] , [2, 2, 3, 3, 3] , and [3, 2, 3, 3, 3] .\n\nIn the second test case, the values at all vertices are known, so there is\nonly one suitable binary search tree.",

        "description": "You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may\nplay in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a\nplayer switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a\nspecially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.\nThis video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in\nother words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is\nthe same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .\nTherefore, you need to create \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,\none for each possible pair of different scenarios.\n\nEach transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too\nmany funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is\nto create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the\nplayer approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \\lceil\n\\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.\n\nYou have already come up with ideas for at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor of\nthe transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or\nscary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos\nin such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 24 ) \u2014 the number of\nscenarios in the game.\n\nThe next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those\nlines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds\nto the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be\nF if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding\ntransition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is\nstill undecided, or . if i=j .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is\nguaranteed that at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded\ndown) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most\n2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as\nthe input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character\nof the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S\nif the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .\n\nEach ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all\nother characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that\nthe i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th\nline are the same for all i and j .\n\nFor each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition\nvideos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more\nthan \\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the\nsame type consecutively.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for\nall inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always\nexists.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    .?F??\n    \n    ?.???\n    \n    F?.S?\n    \n    ??S.?\n    \n    ????.\n\nOutput\n\n    .FFFF\n    F.FFF\n    FF.SF\n    FFS.F\n    FFFF.\n\nInput\n\n    12\n    \n    .???????????\n    \n    ?.??????????\n    \n    ??.?????????\n    \n    ???.????????\n    \n    ????.???????\n    \n    ?????.??????\n    \n    ??????.?????\n    \n    ???????.????\n    \n    ????????.???\n    \n    ?????????.??\n    \n    ??????????.?\n    \n    ???????????.\n\nOutput\n\n    .SSSFFSSSSFS\n    S.SFFSFSFFFS\n    SS.SFFFSSSFS\n    SFS.FFSSSSFS\n    FFFF.FFFFFSF\n    FSFFF.SFFSFF\n    SFFSFS.SSSFS\n    SSSSFFS.SSFS\n    SFSSFFSS.SFS\n    SFSSFSSSS.FS\n    FFFFSFFFFF.F\n    SSSSFFSSSSF.\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first sample: We are allowed \\lceil \\frac{3\\cdot 5}{4} \\rceil=4\ntransition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5\nscenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we\ncan choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen\ntypes.\n\nIn the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios\nis 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following\nsequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though\nthis sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary\ntransition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\\lceil\n\\frac{3\\cdot 12}{4} \\rceil=9 ).",

        "description": "The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are\neven.\n\nAfter some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of\nthe Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n. All a_{i} are even.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

The cost of this operation is k . \n  * Choose two integers i , j (1 \\le i \\le n , 1 \\le j \\le m ) and hire the i -th Pok\u00e9mon to duel with the current Pok\u00e9mon in the arena based on the j -th attribute. The i -th Pok\u00e9mon will win if a_{i,j} is greater than or equal to the j -th attribute of the current Pok\u00e9mon in the arena (otherwise, it will lose). After the duel, only the winner will stand in the arena. The cost of this operation is c_i . \n\nFind the minimum cost you need to pay to have the n -th Pok\u00e9mon stand in the\narena.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 \\le n \\le 4\n\\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 , 2 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^5 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n (1\n\\le c_i \\le 10^9 ).\n\nThe i -th of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2},\n\\ldots, a_{i,m} (1 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^9 ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n \\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed\n4 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum cost to make the n -th Pok\u00e9mon stand in\nthe arena.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 3 1\n    \n    2 9 9\n    \n    6 1 7\n    \n    1 2 1\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 3 1\n    \n    9 9 9\n    \n    6 1 7\n    \n    1 2 1\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 8 3 5\n    \n    18 24\n    \n    17 10\n    \n    1 10\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    6 3\n    \n    21412674 3212925 172015806 250849370 306960171 333018900\n    \n    950000001 950000001 950000001\n    \n    821757276 783362401 760000001\n    \n    570000001 700246226 600757652\n    \n    380000001 423513575 474035234\n    \n    315201473 300580025 287023445\n    \n    1 1 1\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    6\n    17\n    1224474550\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the attribute array of the 1 -st Pok\u00e9mon (which is\nstanding in the arena initially) is [2,9,9] .\n\nIn the first operation, you can choose i=3 , j=1 , k=1 , and increase a_{3,1}\nby 1 permanently. Now the attribute array of the 3 -rd Pok\u00e9mon is [2,2,1] .\nThe cost of this operation is k = 1 .\n\nIn the second operation, you can choose i=3 , j=1 , and hire the 3 -rd Pok\u00e9mon\nto duel with the current Pok\u00e9mon in the arena based on the 1 -st attribute.\nSince a_{i,j}=a_{3,1}=2 \\ge 2=a_{1,1} , the 3 -rd Pok\u00e9mon will win. The cost\nof this operation is c_3 = 1 .\n\nThus, we have made the 3 -rd Pok\u00e9mon stand in the arena within the cost of 2 .\nIt can be proven that 2 is minimum possible.\n\nIn the second test case, the attribute array of the 1 -st Pok\u00e9mon in the arena\nis [9,9,9] .\n\nIn the first operation, you can choose i=2 , j=3 , k=2 , and increase a_{2,3}\nby 2 permanently.

        "description": "There is a hidden tree with n vertices. The n-1 edges of the tree are numbered\nfrom 1 to n-1 . You can ask the following queries of two types:\n\n  1. Give the grader an array a with n - 1 positive integers. For each edge from 1 to n - 1 , the weight of edge i is set to a_i . Then, the grader will return the length of the diameter^\\dagger . \n  2. Give the grader two indices 1 \\le a, b \\le n - 1 . The grader will return the number of edges between edges a and b . In other words, if edge a connects u_a and v_a while edge b connects u_b and v_b , the grader will return \\min(\\text{dist}(u_a, u_b), \\text{dist}(v_a, u_b), \\text{dist}(u_a, v_b), \\text{dist}(v_a, v_b)) , where \\text{dist}(u, v) represents the number of edges on the path between vertices u and v . \n\nFind any tree isomorphic^\\ddagger to the hidden tree after at most n queries\nof type 1 and n queries of type 2 in any order.\n\n^\\dagger The distance between two vertices is the sum of the weights on the\nunique simple path that connects them. The diameter is the largest of all\nthose distances.\n\n^\\ddagger Two trees, consisting of n vertices each, are called isomorphic if\nthere exists a permutation p containing integers from 1 to n such that edge (u\n, v ) is present in the first tree if and only if the edge (p_u , p_v ) is\npresent in the second tree.\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line of input contains a single integer n (3 \\le n \\le 1000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nInteraction\n\nBegin the interaction by reading n .\n\nYou are allowed to make queries in the following way:\n\n  1. \"\\mathtt{?}\\,1\\,a_1\\,a_2 \\ldots a_{n-1} \" (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 ). Then, you should read an integer k which represents the length of the diameter. You are only allowed to ask this query at most n times. \n  2. \"\\mathtt{?}\\,2\\,a\\,b \" (1 \\le a, b \\le n - 1 ). Then, you should read an integer k which represents the number of edges between edges a and b . You are only allowed to ask this query at most n times. \n\nIn case your query is invalid. the program will terminate immediately and you\nwill receive Wrong answer verdict.\n\nTo give the final answer, print \"!\" on a single line, followed by n - 1 lines\nwhere line i contains \"u_i\\,v_i \" (1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n ) which represents\nthat for each i from 1 to n-1 , there is an edge between u_i and v_i .\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (3 \\le n \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree.\n\nThe next n - 1 lines contain two integers each u_i, v_i (1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n\n) \u2014 the edges of the tree.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    3\n    \n    1\n    \n    9\n    \n    0\n\nOutput\n\n    ? 1 1 1 1 1\n    \n    ? 2 1 3\n    \n    ? 1 4 3 2 1\n    \n    ? 2 4 2\n    \n    !\n    3 1\n    4 2\n    1 2\n    2 5\n    \nNote\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5334b2102db64f7747291da5ff17c01fbb81f46b.png)\n\nThe hidden tree in the example is shown above. The number on the vertices\nrepresents the vertex number while the number on the edges represents the edge\nnumber.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d176b128e16b1512770615060a932b192d97eb43.png)\n\nIn the first query, all the edges are set to weight 1 , so the diameter has\nlength 3 as shown in the diagram.\n\nIn the second query, there is 1 edge between edges 1 and 3 .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/0dc59747b539fa2e8c30eb974b3b8078a71acbf4.png)\n\nIn the third query, the diameter is 9 by taking edges 1 , 2 and 3 .\n\nIn the fourth query, there are no edges between edges 4 and 2 .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/5e00319b90942cf9e75f7d76e0cd382e9e4c413e.png)\n\nThe answer given in the example is shown in the above diagram.

The\nrules are as follows:\n\n  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.\n  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.\n  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.\n  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.\n  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.\n\nHelp Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 20\\,000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases.

He asked Kirill\nif he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.\n\nYou are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be\nfound. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers\nfrom 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but\n[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is\nalso not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nYou decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced\nalgorithm for the search \u2014 binary search. However, you forgot that for binary\nsearch, the array must be sorted.\n\nYou did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order\nto get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more\nthan 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\\le i, j\n\\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .\n\nAfter that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,\ntwo variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is\nexecuted:\n\n  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop \n  2. m = \\lfloor \\frac{r + l}{2} \\rfloor \n  3. If p_m \\le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . \n\nThe goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm\nso that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown\nthat 2 operations are always sufficient.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

The tickets will be on sale for n days,\nand by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at\nday i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert\norganizers have implemented the following measures:\n\n  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. \n  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . \n\nFor example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they\nwill cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,\n7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an\nadditional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .\n\nFind the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position.

        "description": "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value\nof n .\n\nProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \\le i \\le\nm , 1 \\le j \\le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,\nhe obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted\ninto the array a ).\n\nTo determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the\nproblems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i\n> 1 ).\n\nWhat is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at\nmost one problem, created according to the described rules?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of prepared problems,\nthe number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots a_n\n(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) \u2014 the complexities of the\nprepared problems.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots d_m\n(1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the models.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dots f_k\n(1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the functions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single number \u2014 the minimum imbalance that Rudolf\ncan achieve.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    5 5 5\n    \n    5 10 15 20 26\n    \n    11 14 16 13 8\n    \n    16 4 5 3 1\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 9 3 2\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 13 3 2\n    \n    5 6 3\n    \n    2 10 13 20 25\n    \n    11 6 10 16 14 5\n    \n    6 17 15\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    11 12 14 15\n    \n    19 14\n    \n    10 6\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30\n    \n    9 13 16 15\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 4 7\n    \n    4 21\n    \n    4 15 14 5\n    \n    20 1 15 1 12 5 11\n\nOutput\n\n    5\n    4\n    5\n    8\n    2\n    7\n    11",

        "description": "Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a\n32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,\ndiamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',\n'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',\n'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.\n\nEach card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8\nof Hearts is denoted as 8H.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.\n\nIn each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of\nhis cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of\ntheir cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.\n\nA card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first\ncard has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.\nAdditionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank\nof the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat\n9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher\nrank.\n\nThere were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n\ncards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in\nthe discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that\nmight have been played in the game.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \\le t \\le 100 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then t test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\\le n\\le 16 ).\n\nThe second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is\none of \"CDHS\".\n\nThe third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card\nis described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the\ncard, which is one of \"23456789\", and the second one is the suit of the card,\nwhich is one of \"CDHS\". All cards are different.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer to it:\n\n  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.\n  * If there is no solution, print a single line \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    8\n    \n    3\n    \n    S\n    \n    3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    3S 5D 9S 6H\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    6C 5D\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    7S 3S\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    C\n    \n    9D 8H\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    9C 9S 6H 8C\n\nOutput\n\n    3C 4C\n    6D 9S\n    3S 7S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    3S 7S\n    9S 9H\n    9H 9S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    6H 9C\n    9S 8C",

Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 3 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

At node 9 with index 3, we again compare the index to the left-child\n           node with value 4. Because the index is the less than the left-child\n           node, we simply traverse to the left.\n \n        3. At node 4 with index 3, we recognize that we are at a leaf node and\n           stop iterating.\n \n        4. To compute the sublist index, we subtract the offset from the index\n           of the leaf node: 5 - 3 = 2.

The sheet can then be cut along the lines x =\n1,2,\\ldots,w-1 and the lines y = 1,2,\\ldots,h-1 . In each step, the paper is\ncut randomly along any one of these h+w-2 lines. After each vertical and\nhorizontal cut, the right and bottom piece of paper respectively are\ndiscarded.\n\nFind the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of\npaper strictly less than k .

        "description": "Turtle Alice is currently designing a fortune cookie box, and she would like\nto incorporate the theory of LuoShu into it.\n\nThe box can be seen as an n \\times m grid (n, m \\ge 5 ), where the rows are\nnumbered 1, 2, \\dots, n and columns are numbered 1, 2, \\dots, m . Each cell\ncan either be empty or have a single fortune cookie of one of the following\nshapes: circle or square. The cell at the intersection of the a -th row and\nthe b -th column is denoted as (a, b) .\n\nInitially, the entire grid is empty. Then, Alice performs q operations on the\nfortune cookie box. The i -th operation (1 \\le i \\le q ) is as follows:\nspecify a currently empty cell (r_i,c_i) and a shape (circle or square), then\nput a fortune cookie of the specified shape on cell (r_i,c_i) . Note that\nafter the i -th operation, the cell (r_i,c_i) is no longer empty.\n\nBefore all operations and after each of the q operations, Alice wonders what\nthe number of ways to place fortune cookies in all remaining empty cells is,\nsuch that the following condition is satisfied:\n\nNo three consecutive cells (in horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal\ndirections) contain cookies of the same shape. Formally:\n\n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i,j+1), (i,j+2) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j+2) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j+2), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j) . \n\nYou should output all answers modulo 998\\,244\\,353 . Also note that it is\npossible that after some operations, the condition is already not satisfied\nwith the already placed candies, in this case you should output 0 .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ) \u2014\nthe number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , q (5 \\le n, m\n\\le 10^9, 0 \\le q \\le \\min(n \\times m, 10^5) ).\n\nThe i -th of the next q lines contains two integers r_i , c_i and a single\nstring \\text{shape}_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n, 1 \\le c_i \\le m , \\text{shape}_i=\n\"circle\" or \"square\"), representing the operations. It is guaranteed that the\ncell on the r_i -th row and the c_i -th column is initially empty. That means,\neach (r_i,c_i) will appear at most once in the updates.\n\nThe sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output q+1 lines. The first line of each test case should\ncontain the answer before any operations. The i -th line (2 \\le i \\le q+1 )\nshould contain the answer after the first i-1 operations.

        "description": "One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the\ncamp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,\nthe organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks\nand a huge number of shells for launching.\n\nBoth installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation\nlaunches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \\cdot a, 3 \\cdot a, \\dots\nminutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b\nminutes (i.e., after b, 2 \\cdot b, 3 \\cdot b, \\dots minutes after launch).\n\nEach firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a\nfirework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,\nit will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework\nwas launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one\nminute.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the\nsame time?\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then follow the\ndescriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \\le\na, b, m \\le 10^{18} ) \u2014 the frequency of launching for the first installation,\nthe second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output a single number \u2014 the maximum number of\nfireworks that can be seen simultaneously.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    6 7 4\n    \n    3 4 10\n    \n    7 8 56\n    \n    5 6 78123459896\n    \n    1 1 1\n    \n    1 1 1000000000000000000\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    7\n    17\n    28645268630\n    4\n    2000000000000000002\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5\nminutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and\nthe second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same\ninstallation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same\ntime, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the\nfirst and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to\nsee no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.\n\nIn the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112\nminutes:\n\n  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; \n  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].",

Let x be the power of the card with the largest power in her hand. \n  2. Place a single card with power x back into the draw pile. \n  3. Randomly draw x cards from the draw pile. All subsets of x cards from the draw pile have an equal chance of being drawn.

        "description": "Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a\n32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,\ndiamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',\n'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',\n'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.\n\nEach card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8\nof Hearts is denoted as 8H.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.\n\nIn each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of\nhis cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of\ntheir cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.\n\nA card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first\ncard has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.\nAdditionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank\nof the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat\n9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher\nrank.\n\nThere were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n\ncards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in\nthe discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that\nmight have been played in the game.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \\le t \\le 100 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then t test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\\le n\\le 16 ).\n\nThe second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is\none of \"CDHS\".\n\nThe third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card\nis described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the\ncard, which is one of \"23456789\", and the second one is the suit of the card,\nwhich is one of \"CDHS\". All cards are different.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer to it:\n\n  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.\n  * If there is no solution, print a single line \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    8\n    \n    3\n    \n    S\n    \n    3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    3S 5D 9S 6H\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    6C 5D\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    7S 3S\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    C\n    \n    9D 8H\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    9C 9S 6H 8C\n\nOutput\n\n    3C 4C\n    6D 9S\n    3S 7S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    3S 7S\n    9S 9H\n    9H 9S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    6H 9C\n    9S 8C",

They are numbered from 1\nto n in the clockwise order.\n\nLet's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his\nneighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nLet's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player\ny_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be\nmade to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the\nclockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2\nto 5 is 4 .\n\nInitially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered\nclockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance\nof r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if\nthere are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it\na distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player\n(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An\nillustration of this example is shown below.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/29f44c71d01625dfd7795270dbc36b2737f0b368.png)\n\nThe game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain.

Each of them\ncontains an integer r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) \u2014 the distance at which the i\n-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':\n\n  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, \n  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, \n  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum n \\cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test\ncases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\n\nIn the first line, output the number of players k (1 \\le k \\le n ) who could\nhave the ball at the end of the game.\n\nIn the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \\le b_i \\le n ) \u2014 the numbers of the\nplayers in increasing order.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger and a Golden Snitch can be present.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point. If a player catches the Golden Snitch, their team wins 10\npoints and the game is over.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent the Bludger. \n  * .S to represent the Golden Snitch.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input. \n  * If the Golden Snitch is caught, you must print t RED CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH or t BLUE CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH, depending on the team who caught the Golden Snitch, where t is the current time.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written is alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

Then, B0 moves to the position of the Bludger: B0 is eliminated\ntoo.\n\nIn the fourth example, a red player catches the Golden Snitch.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

        "description": "In TreeWorld, there is a popular two-player game played on a tree with n\nvertices labelled from 1 to n . In this game, the tournament leaders first\nchoose a vertex to be the root of the tree and choose another vertex (possibly\nthe same vertex as the root) to place a coin on. Then, each player will take\nturns moving the coin to any child^\\dagger of the vertex that the coin is\ncurrently on. The first player who is unable to make a move loses.\n\nAlice wants to be a tree LGM, so she spends a lot of time studying the game.\nShe wrote down an n by n matrix s , where s_{i,j} = \\mathtt{1} if the first\nplayer can win with the root of the tree chosen to be vertex i , and the coin\nwas initially placed on vertex j . Otherwise, s_{i, j} = \\mathtt{0} . Alice is\na perfectionist, so she assumes that both players play perfectly in the game.\n\nHowever, she accidentally knocked her head on the way to the tournament and\nforgot what the tree looked like. Determine whether there exists a tree that\nsatisfies the winning and losing states represented by matrix s , and if it\nexists, construct a valid tree.\n\n^\\dagger A vertex c is a child of vertex u if there is an edge between c and u\n, and c does not lie on the unique simple path from the root to vertex u .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 5000 ) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains a string with n characters, the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line representing s_{i, j} (s_{i, j} \\in \\\\{\\mathtt{0},\n\\mathtt{1}\\\\} ) \u2014 the winning and losing states of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no tree satisfying the winning and losing states represented by\nmatrix s , print a single line containing \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, if there exists a tree satisfying matrix s , print \"YES\" on the\nfirst line, followed by n - 1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1\n\\le u, v \\le n ) representing that the tree has an edge between vertices u and\nv .\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower).

At this point, 1 has no children, so the\nsecond player is unable to make a move and loses. On the other hand, s_{1,3} =\n0 as if 1 is the root, then 3 has no children so the first player is unable to\nmake the first move and loses.\n\nIn the second test case, it is possible to prove that no tree satisfies the\nwinning and losing states represented by matrix s .",

        "description": "Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 3 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

At node 9 with index 3, we again compare the index to the left-child\n           node with value 4. Because the index is the less than the left-child\n           node, we simply traverse to the left.\n \n        3. At node 4 with index 3, we recognize that we are at a leaf node and\n           stop iterating.\n \n        4. To compute the sublist index, we subtract the offset from the index\n           of the leaf node: 5 - 3 = 2.

After that, Vasya counts how many\ntimes each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.\nYou need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.\n\n^{\\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct\nintegers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a\npermutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),\nand [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

In the name of\nthis great goal, they rallied around the powerful elf Timothy and began to\nplan the overthrow of the ruler of the Lonely Mountain.\n\nThe army of Middle-earth inhabitants will consist of several squads. It is\nknown that each pair of creatures of the same race, which are in different\nsquads, adds b units to the total strength of the army. But since it will be\ndifficult for Timothy to lead an army consisting of a large number of squads,\nthe total strength of an army consisting of k squads is reduced by (k - 1)\n\\cdot x units. Note that the army always consists of at least one squad.\n\nIt is known that there are n races in Middle-earth, and the number of\ncreatures of the i -th race is equal to c_i . Help the inhabitants of Middle-\nearth determine the maximum strength of the army they can assemble.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The inhabitants can be distributed among the squads as follows:\n\n  * The single representative of the first species can be sent to the first squad.\n  * The first representative of the second species can be sent to the first squad, the second representative of the second species can be sent to the second squad.

Then the total strength of the army will increase by 3 \\cdot b = 3 , as they form three pairs in different squads.\n\nThus, the total strength of the army is 4 .\n\nIn the second test case, the inhabitants of Middle-earth can form 3 squads.\nSince x = 10 , the army's strength will decrease by 20 . The inhabitants can\nbe distributed among the squads as follows:\n\n  * The first representative of the first species can be sent to the first squad, the second representative of the first species can be sent to the second squad. Then the total strength of the army will increase by b = 5 .\n  * The first and second representatives of the second species can be sent to the first squad, the third and fourth representatives of the second species can be sent to the second squad, the fifth representative of the second species can be sent to the third squad. Then the total strength of the army will increase by 8 \\cdot b = 40 .\n  * The first representative of the third species can be sent to the first squad, the second representative of the third species can be sent to the second squad, the third representative of the third species can be sent to the third squad.

The value of node v will be a_v . \n  * Alice will choose two nodes u and v (1 \\leq u, v \\leq n , u \\neq v ) of T and tell them to Bob. Bob will need to find the \\operatorname{MEX}^\\dagger of the values on the unique simple path between nodes u and v . \n  * To find this value, Bob can ask Alice at most 5 queries.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger and a Golden Snitch can be present.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point. If a player catches the Golden Snitch, their team wins 10\npoints and the game is over.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent the Bludger. \n  * .S to represent the Golden Snitch.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input. \n  * If the Golden Snitch is caught, you must print t RED CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH or t BLUE CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH, depending on the team who caught the Golden Snitch, where t is the current time.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written is alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

For example:\n\n  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. \n  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. \n  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. \n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (0\n\\le a_i < n ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    4\n    \n    0 0 1 1\n    \n    4\n    \n    0 1 2 3\n    \n    2\n    \n    1 1\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    1\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:\n\n  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . \n  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . \n  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . \n  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\\,] and c=[1,0] . \n\nAt the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game\nand does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.",

        "description": "Yasya was walking in the forest and accidentally found a tree with n vertices.\nA tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles.\n\nNext to the tree, the girl found an ancient manuscript with m queries written\non it. The queries can be of two types.\n\nThe first type of query is described by the integer y . The weight of each\nedge in the tree is replaced by the [bitwise exclusive\nOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of the weight of that edge and the integer y\n.\n\nThe second type is described by the vertex v and the integer x . Yasya chooses\na vertex u (1 \\le u \\le n , u \\neq v ) and mentally draws a bidirectional edge\nof weight x from v to u in the tree.\n\nThen Yasya finds a simple cycle in the resulting graph and calculates the\n[bitwise exclusive OR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of all the edges in it.\nShe wants to choose a vertex u such that the calculated value is maximum. This\ncalculated value will be the answer to the query. It can be shown that such a\ncycle exists and is unique under the given constraints (independent of the\nchoice of u ). If an edge between v and u already existed, a simple cycle is\nthe path v \\to u \\to v .\n\nNote that the second type of query is performed mentally, meaning the tree\ndoes not change in any way after it.\n\nHelp Yasya answer all the queries.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases.\n\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (2 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree\nand the number of queries.\n\nThe next n - 1 lines of each test case contain three integers v , u , w (1 \\le\nv, u \\le n , 1 \\le w \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the ends of some edge in the tree and its\nweight.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.\n\nThe next m lines of each test case describe the queries:\n\n  * ^ y (1 \\le y \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 parameter of the first type query; \n  * ? v x (1 \\le v \\le n , 1 \\le x \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 parameters of the second type query. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .

The difference in this version is\nthat t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.\n\nRon and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially\ninactive.

The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with\na stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists\nof picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the\nstone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after\nwhich he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player\nthat cannot make a move loses the round.

        "description": "After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of\nthe Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    1 3 0 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    2 1\n    4 1\n    1 1\n    3 1\n    3 3 3 1\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number\nof queries respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the\nstring s only contains lowercase English characters.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \\le l < r \\le n ).\n\nIt is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5\n.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\\ldots s_r) .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    4 4\n    \n    aaab\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    2 4\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    abc\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    5 4\n    \n    pqpcc\n    \n    1 5\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    2 4\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    aa\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    12 1\n    \n    steponnopets\n    \n    1 12\n\nOutput\n\n    9\n    0\n    2\n    5\n    5\n    2\n    14\n    0\n    2\n    5\n    0\n    65\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first query of the first test case, the string is \\mathtt{aaab} .\n\\mathtt{aaab} , \\mathtt{aab} and \\mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not\npalindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string\nis 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .\n\nIn the second query of the first test case, the string is \\mathtt{aaa} . There\nare no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .\n\nIn the first query of the second test case, the string is \\mathtt{abc} .\n\\mathtt{ab} , \\mathtt{bc} and \\mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not\npalindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively.

        "description": "You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may\nplay in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a\nplayer switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a\nspecially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.\nThis video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in\nother words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is\nthe same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .\nTherefore, you need to create \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,\none for each possible pair of different scenarios.\n\nEach transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too\nmany funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is\nto create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the\nplayer approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \\lceil\n\\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.\n\nYou have already come up with ideas for at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor of\nthe transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or\nscary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos\nin such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 24 ) \u2014 the number of\nscenarios in the game.\n\nThe next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those\nlines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds\nto the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be\nF if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding\ntransition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is\nstill undecided, or . if i=j .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is\nguaranteed that at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded\ndown) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most\n2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as\nthe input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character\nof the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S\nif the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .\n\nEach ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all\nother characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that\nthe i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th\nline are the same for all i and j .\n\nFor each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition\nvideos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more\nthan \\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the\nsame type consecutively.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  \nCharacter| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  \n  \nThe last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case\n\"()(()())\". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced\nshuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle\nof the input sequence.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced\nparentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will\nomit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of\ntwo different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore\nthe balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced\nparentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).\n\nYou are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced\nparentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given\nsequence.\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters \"(\"\nand \")\". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses\nsequence with its length not exceeding 1\\,000 .\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t\nis equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    ()(()())\n    \nOutput\n\n    (()(()))",

There are two types of\noperations that you can apply to it:\n\n  1. Add the reversed string s to the end of the string s (for example, if s = cpm, then after applying the operation s = cpmmpc). \n  2. Reverse the current string s (for example, if s = cpm, then after applying the operation s = mpc). \n\nIt is required to determine the lexicographically smallest^{\\dagger} string\nthat can be obtained after applying exactly n operations. Note that you can\napply operations of different types in any order, but you must apply exactly n\noperations in total.\n\n^{\\dagger} A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only\nif one of the following holds:\n\n  * a is a prefix of b , but a \\ne b ; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b . \n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

Of course, they would like to test\nthe hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,\nbecause they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's\nbattery charge.\n\nScientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current\nstate of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \\dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if\nthere is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.\n\nFortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so\nin one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:\n\n  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). \n  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). \n  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). \n\nIt has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.\nTherefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes\ns_1, \\dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \\dots, f_n .\n\nDue to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve\nthis problem.
