Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. \n\nThe rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.\n\nEach of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single line: \"YES\" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nxx..\n.oo.\nx...\noox.\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\nx.ox\nox..\nx.o.\noo.x\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\nx..x\n..oo\no...\nx.xo\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\no.x.\no...\n.x..\nooxx\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.\n\nIn the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.\n\nIn the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.\n\nIn the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.",

        "description": "Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. \n\nThe rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.\n\nEach of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint single line: \"YES\" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\nxx..\n.oo.\nx...\noox.\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\nx.ox\nox..\nx.o.\noo.x\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\nx..x\n..oo\no...\nx.xo\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\no.x.\no...\n.x..\nooxx\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.\n\nIn the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.\n\nIn the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.\n\nIn the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.",
