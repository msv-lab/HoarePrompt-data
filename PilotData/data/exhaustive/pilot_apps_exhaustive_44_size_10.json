The ticket can start with the digit 0.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n000000\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n123456\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n111000\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is 0.\n\nIn the second example Luba can replace 4 and 5 with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.\n\nIn the third example Luba can replace any zero with 3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.",
