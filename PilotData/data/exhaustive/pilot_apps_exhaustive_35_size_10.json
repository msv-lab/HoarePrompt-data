For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.\n\nFor a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer — the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n8\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n9\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:\n\nWeight 1: [$\\textbf 7$] \n\nWeight 2: [$\\textbf 3$, $\\textbf 3$, 1] \n\nWeight 3: [$\\textbf 2$, $\\textbf 2$, $\\textbf 2$, 1] \n\nWeight 7: [$\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$, $\\textbf 1$]",
