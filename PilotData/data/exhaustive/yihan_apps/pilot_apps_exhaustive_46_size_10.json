You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.\n\nGreatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.\n\nIf there is no possible sequence then output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence.
