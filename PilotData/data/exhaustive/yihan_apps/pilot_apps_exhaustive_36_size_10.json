        "description": "Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.\n\nAlexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.\n\nAlexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.\n\nThe number k doesn't contain leading zeros.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n13\n12\n\nOutput\n12\nInput\n16\n11311\n\nOutput\n475\nInput\n20\n999\n\nOutput\n3789\nInput\n17\n2016\n\nOutput\n594\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.",
