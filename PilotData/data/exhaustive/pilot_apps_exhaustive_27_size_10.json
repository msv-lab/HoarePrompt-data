He cannot go over the obstacles, he can only jump over them. Your task is to determine whether the athlete will be able to get to the finish point.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input containsd four integers n, m, s and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9) — the number of obstacles on the runner's way, the coordinate of the finishing point, the length of running before the jump and the maximum length of the jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m - 1) — the coordinates of the obstacles. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing point have no obstacles, also no point can have more than one obstacle, The coordinates of the obstacles are given in an arbitrary order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the runner cannot reach the finishing point, print in the first line of the output \"IMPOSSIBLE\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf the athlete can get from start to finish, print any way to do this in the following format:  print a line of form \"RUN X>\" (where \"X\" should be a positive integer), if the athlete should run for \"X\" more meters;  print a line of form \"JUMP Y\" (where \"Y\" should be a positive integer), if the sportsman starts a jump and should remain in air for \"Y\" more meters. \n\nAll commands \"RUN\" and \"JUMP\" should strictly alternate, starting with \"RUN\", besides, they should be printed chronologically. It is not allowed to jump over the finishing point but it is allowed to land there after a jump. The athlete should stop as soon as he reaches finish.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 10 1 3\n3 4 7\n\nOutput\nRUN 2\nJUMP 3\nRUN 1\nJUMP 2\nRUN 2\n\nInput\n2 9 2 3\n6 4\n\nOutput\nIMPOSSIBLE",
