Note that the solution of this\nproblem may or may not share ideas with the solution of the solo version. You\ncan solve and get points for both versions independently.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. The game starts with a positive integer n ,\nwith players taking turns. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of\nevents takes place:\n\n  * The player having the integer p breaks it into two integers p_{1} and p_{2} , where 0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . \n  * If no such p_{1} , p_{2} exist, the player loses. \n  * Otherwise, the opponent does either select the integer p_{1} or p_{2} . \n  * The game continues with the selected integer. The opponent will try to break it. \n\nAs Alice, your goal is to win. You can execute a maximum of 63 break\noperations. You have the choice to play first or second. The system will act\nfor Bob.\n\nHere \\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR\noperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Here, p equals one of the two integers printed by Bob in the previous\nturn. If no turn has occurred previously, p is equal to n . If Alice cannot\nperform a break operation, print \"0 0\" to receive a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nOn Bob's turn, you should read two integers, p_{1} and p_{2} such that 0 \\lt\np_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . Here, p equals\none of the two integers printed by Alice in the previous turn. If no turn has\noccurred previously, p is equal to n . If Bob cannot perform a break operation\np_{1} = 0 and p_2 = 0 in which case you should proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf any break operation performed by Alice is invalid, the interactor prints\n\"-1 -1\" and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nIf Alice performs 63 turns and Bob can still execute a break operation on the\ncurrent integers, the interactor prints \"-1 -1\", and your code should promptly\nexit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the\noutput.

Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

He takes it, goes to the goal of the red team, and\nlets the ball there. He scores! The ball gets back to the middle of the field,\na red player takes it and scores too.\n\nIn the second example, the red player takes the Quaffle, move it and throw it.\nThe blue player catches the ball, goes to the red goal and scores.\n\nIn the third example, the red player takes the ball and scores in the goal of\ntheir own team: the blue team wins a point.",

To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to\nstay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for\ngathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of\nmushrooms.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from\n1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is\nnot a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a\npermutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength.

Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. \n  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts \u2014 one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part \u2014 to Bob. \n  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). \n  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). \n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as\npossible.\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them\nto Alice. First, output the integer \\alpha \u2014 the maximum possible size of\nAlice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will\nremain on Bob's plot). Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots,\na_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to \\alpha ); \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than \\alpha ). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn, m \\le 10^9 , 2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the field sizes and the number of\nfountains, respectively.\n\nThen follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n\n, 1 \\le c_i \\le m ) \u2014 the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It\nis guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output \\alpha \u2014 the maximum size of the plot that\ncan belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output\nk non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob; \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob. \n\nIf you output any other positive number instead of 1 that fits into a 64-bit\nsigned integer type, it will also be recognized as 1 . Thus, a solution to the\nhard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    2 2 3\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    5 5 4\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    2 5 9\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1 5\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    2 4\n    \n    2 5\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    6 4 4\n    \n    6 2\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    3 4 5\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    2 4\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    1 0 1 \n    11\n    0 1 0 1 \n    1\n    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n    6\n    1 0 0 0 \n    1\n    1 1 0 0 0 \n    \nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1097a3c831bcbd4e6363a26497eb7991ad8ac903.png)\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green.

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position.

Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of\ntwo different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore\nthe balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced\nparentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).\n\nYou are given a balanced parentheses sequence.

        "description": "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value\nof n .\n\nProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

The easy version only needs you to print whether some values\nare non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n\n\\times m (2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9 ); the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to\nbottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right.

Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but\nshe must meet several conditions:\n\n  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. \n  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts \u2014 one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part \u2014 to Bob. \n  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). \n  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). \n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as\npossible.\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them\nto Alice. First, output the integer \\alpha \u2014 the maximum possible size of\nAlice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will\nremain on Bob's plot).\n\nThen output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k , where a_i is a\nvalue such that after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum size of\nher plot will be \\alpha + a_i .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn, m \\le 10^9 , 2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the field sizes and the number of\nfountains, respectively.\n\nThen follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n\n, 1 \\le c_i \\le m ) \u2014 the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    3 5\n    \n    .. ..

To move to platform j they have to be connected by the\npassage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .\n\nAfter each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform\ni is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \\bmod H , for all i .\n\nYou start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to\nplatform n .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le H \\le 10^9 ).\n\nThe second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform\n(0 \\le l_i \\le H-1 ).\n\nThe third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform\n(0 \\le s_i \\le H-1 ).\n\nNext m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described\nas a pair of integers \u2014 the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at\nmost one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage\nconnecting a platform to itself.\n\nThe sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests\ndoes not exceed 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed\nto get from platform 1 to platform n .\n\nIf it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    3 3 10\n    \n    1 9 4\n    \n    2 3 0\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    2 1 10\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    4 6\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    8 7 25\n    \n    22 14 5 3 10 14 11 1\n    \n    9 5 4 10 7 16 18 18\n    \n    2 8\n    \n    6 3\n    \n    3 5\n    \n    7 5\n    \n    2 6\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    4 7\n\nOutput\n\n    6\n    -1\n    52\n    \nNote\n\nThis is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to\nperform in the first example.\n\n| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nStep 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  \nStep 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  \nStep 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  \nStep 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  \nStep 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  \nStep 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3",

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  \nCharacter| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  \n  \nThe last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case\n\"()(()())\". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced\nshuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle\nof the input sequence.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced\nparentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will\nomit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of\ntwo different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore\nthe balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced\nparentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).\n\nYou are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced\nparentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given\nsequence.\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters \"(\"\nand \")\". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses\nsequence with its length not exceeding 500\\,000 .\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t\nis equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    ()(()())\n    \nOutput\n\n    (()(()))",

If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. \n\nCan you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your\ncharacter?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4 )\n\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines:\n\n  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 ; 1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 ); \n  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 ); \n  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n (-n \\le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \\dots < x_n \\le n ; x_i \\ne 0 ). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 3 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach\nyour character, or NO otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For\nexample, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive\nresponses.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 2 3\n    \n    -1 2 3\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    -1 1\n    \n    4 10\n    \n    3 4 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 1 3\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    2 1 3 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 3 4 5\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1 2\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can act as follows:\n\n  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; \n  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; \n  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. \n\nIn the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of\nthe two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves\ncloser and kills your character.",

The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view.

The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n.

When a\nplayer switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a\nspecially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.\nThis video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in\nother words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is\nthe same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .\nTherefore, you need to create \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,\none for each possible pair of different scenarios.\n\nEach transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too\nmany funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is\nto create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the\nplayer approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \\lceil\n\\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.\n\nYou have already come up with ideas for at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor of\nthe transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or\nscary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos\nin such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 24 ) \u2014 the number of\nscenarios in the game.\n\nThe next n lines describe the partial transition video plan.

It will be\nF if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding\ntransition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is\nstill undecided, or . if i=j .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is\nguaranteed that at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded\ndown) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most\n2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as\nthe input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character\nof the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S\nif the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .\n\nEach ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all\nother characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that\nthe i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th\nline are the same for all i and j .\n\nFor each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition\nvideos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more\nthan \\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the\nsame type consecutively.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

        "description": "The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are\neven.\n\nAfter some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of\nthe Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n. All a_{i} are even.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

Note that the solution of this\nproblem may or may not share ideas with the solution of the solo version. You\ncan solve and get points for both versions independently.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. The game starts with a positive integer n ,\nwith players taking turns. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of\nevents takes place:\n\n  * The player having the integer p breaks it into two integers p_{1} and p_{2} , where 0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . \n  * If no such p_{1} , p_{2} exist, the player loses. \n  * Otherwise, the opponent does either select the integer p_{1} or p_{2} . \n  * The game continues with the selected integer. The opponent will try to break it. \n\nAs Alice, your goal is to win. You can execute a maximum of 63 break\noperations. You have the choice to play first or second. The system will act\nfor Bob.\n\nHere \\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR\noperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Here, p equals one of the two integers printed by Bob in the previous\nturn. If no turn has occurred previously, p is equal to n . If Alice cannot\nperform a break operation, print \"0 0\" to receive a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nOn Bob's turn, you should read two integers, p_{1} and p_{2} such that 0 \\lt\np_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . Here, p equals\none of the two integers printed by Alice in the previous turn. If no turn has\noccurred previously, p is equal to n . If Bob cannot perform a break operation\np_{1} = 0 and p_2 = 0 in which case you should proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf any break operation performed by Alice is invalid, the interactor prints\n\"-1 -1\" and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nIf Alice performs 63 turns and Bob can still execute a break operation on the\ncurrent integers, the interactor prints \"-1 -1\", and your code should promptly\nexit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the\noutput.

After settling the spirits,\nthe Ministry of Magic is looking to renovate the prison to ensure that the\nDementors are kept in check. The prison consists of n prison cells and m bi-\ndirectional corridors. The i^{th} corridor is from cells u_i to v_i . A subset\nof these cells S is called a complex if any cell in S is reachable from any\nother cell in S . Formally, a subset of cells S is a complex if x and y are\nreachable from each other for all x, y \\in S , using only cells from S on the\nway. The funding required for a complex S consisting of k cells is defined as\nk^2 .\n\nAs part of your Intro to Magical Interior Design course at Hogwarts, you have\nbeen tasked with designing the prison. The Ministry of Magic has asked that\nyou divide the prison into 2 complexes with \\textbf{exactly one corridor}\nconnecting them, so that the Dementors can't organize union meetings. For this\npurpose, you are allowed to build bi-directional corridors. The funding\nrequired to build a corridor between any 2 cells is c .\n\nDue to budget cuts and the ongoing fight against the Death Eaters, you must\nfind the \\textbf{minimum total funding} required to divide the prison as per\nthe Ministry's requirements or -1 if no division is possible.\n\nNote: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 complexes\nand the corridors built.

        "description": "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value\nof n .\n\nProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. \n\nCan you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your\ncharacter?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4 )\n\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines:\n\n  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5 ; 1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 ); \n  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 ); \n  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n (-n \\le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \\dots < x_n \\le n ; x_i \\ne 0 ). \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 3 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach\nyour character, or NO otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For\nexample, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive\nresponses.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 2 3\n    \n    -1 2 3\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    -1 1\n    \n    4 10\n    \n    3 4 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 1 3\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    2 1 3 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 3 4 5\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1 2\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can act as follows:\n\n  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; \n  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; \n  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. \n\nIn the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of\nthe two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves\ncloser and kills your character.",

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2\n), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from\nthis state \u2014\n\n  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. \n  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. \n  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around.

The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    1 3 0 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    2 1\n    4 1\n    1 1\n    3 1\n    3 3 3 1\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

        "description": "This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the\nmovements of the amoeba.\n\nAmoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body\noccupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.\nAmanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each\nstep of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the\nbody is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one\npreviously-free pixel is added to the body).\n\nTo prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region\nof pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be\nconnected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two\npixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at\nmost 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,\nincluding the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.\n\nYour task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position\nand desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the\nformer to the latter.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/8d732857e67e5cd7cb6a0af1ed34584572413ddc.png)\nIllustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the\ndotted region is the final position.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers r and c (1\\le r,c \\le 50 ) \u2014 the size of\nthe rectangular grid in pixels.\n\nThe next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of\nAmanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \\texttt{.} denoting a free\npixel, an asterisk \\texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \\texttt{X}\ndenoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.\n\nThe next line is empty.\n\nThe next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the\ninitial position.\n\nIt is guaranteed that:\n\n  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. \n  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. \n  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. \n  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint \\texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial\nposition to the final one. Otherwise, print \\texttt{NO} .\n\nIf it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\\le m\\le 10\\,000 ) \u2014\nthe number of moves to execute.\n\nThe following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,\ni_2 , j_2 (1\\le i_1,i_2\\le r , 1\\le j_1,j_2\\le c ). These four coordinates\nspecify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is\nfirst removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different\nlocation where one pixel is added.\n\nThe sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,\nAmanda's body should occupy the desired final position.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nUnder the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible\nfor Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it\nis possible to do it with at most 10\\,000 moves.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 8\n    \n    .******.\n    \n    **.X**..\n    \n    *******.\n    \n    **.X**..\n    \n    .******.\n    \n    .******.\n    \n    ...X****\n    \n    .*******\n    \n    ...X****\n    \n    .******.\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    5\n    3 1 3 8\n    2 1 2 8\n    4 1 4 8\n    2 2 4 7\n    4 2 2 7\n    \nInput\n\n    2 5\n    \n    *.X..\n    \n    **X..\n    \n    ..X**\n    \n    ..X*.\n\nOutput\n\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first sample, Amanda executes 5 moves to reach the final position, as\nshown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/04b7bb193a243e0eaf83952861f5275e04543407.png)",

        "description": "This is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only\nby the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values\nare non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n\n\\times m (2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9 ), the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to\nbottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell\nat the intersection of row r and column c is denoted as (r, c ).\n\nBob has k (2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) fountains, all of them are located in\ndifferent cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but\nshe must meet several conditions:\n\n  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. \n  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts \u2014 one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part \u2014 to Bob. \n  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). \n  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). \n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as\npossible.\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them\nto Alice. First, output the integer \\alpha \u2014 the maximum possible size of\nAlice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will\nremain on Bob's plot). Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots,\na_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to \\alpha ); \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than \\alpha ). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn, m \\le 10^9 , 2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the field sizes and the number of\nfountains, respectively.\n\nThen follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n\n, 1 \\le c_i \\le m ) \u2014 the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It\nis guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output \\alpha \u2014 the maximum size of the plot that\ncan belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output\nk non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k , where:\n\n  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob; \n  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob. \n\nIf you output any other positive number instead of 1 that fits into a 64-bit\nsigned integer type, it will also be recognized as 1 . Thus, a solution to the\nhard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    2 2 3\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    5 5 4\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    2 5 9\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1 5\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    2 4\n    \n    2 5\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    6 4 4\n    \n    6 2\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    3 4 5\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    2 4\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    1 0 1 \n    11\n    0 1 0 1 \n    1\n    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n    6\n    1 0 0 0 \n    1\n    1 1 0 0 0 \n    \nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1097a3c831bcbd4e6363a26497eb7991ad8ac903.png)\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green. The cells belonging to\nAlice are marked in blue.\n\nNote that if Bob gives Alice fountain 1 or fountain 3 , then that fountain\ncannot be on Alice's plot.",
