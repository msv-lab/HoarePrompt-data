However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.\n\nA time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.\n\nNote that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day.

        "description": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \u2014 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \u2014 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \u2014 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings\u00a0\u2014 the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1s 2s 3s\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n9m 9m 9m\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3p 9m 2p\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.\n\nIn the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.\n\nIn the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile\u00a0\u2014 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].",

        "description": "Vova again tries to play some computer card game.\n\nThe rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed.

        "description": "Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R \u2014 move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. \n\nVasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.\n\nVasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. \n\nIf there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.\n\nHelp Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$ \u2014 the number of operations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of operations \u2014 a string of $n$ characters.

If this change is impossible, print $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\nRURUU\n-2 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\nRULR\n1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3\nUUU\n100 100\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nIn the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.\n\nIn the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.",

        "description": "Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.\n\nAssume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.\n\nIn the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. \n\nThe first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.\n\nNeko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?\n\nNote that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \\le t \\le 40$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations to apply.\n\nThen for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\\lceil \\frac{t}{2} \\rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \\le n_i \\le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \\oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.

Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. \n\nIn the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.",

        "description": "It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them. When checking the correctness of the answer, all comparisons are made with the permissible absolute error, equal to 10^{ - 8}. \n\nIt is recommended to print as many characters after the decimal point as possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 10 13 10 3 1\n\nOutput\n4.3750000000\n\nInput\n1 4 6 2 2 1\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n3 10 15 17 9 2\n\nOutput\n11.3333333333\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote that in the first and third samples other correct values of abscissa x_{w} are also possible.",

For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009, even though 2000000020\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009 is a smaller number.",

        "description": "Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! \n\nHowever, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 l \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x < y \u2264 l) \u2014 the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single non-negative integer v \u2014 the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.\n\nIn the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order.

Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.\n\nYou may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \\times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \\le x < n$ and $1 \\le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.\n\nYour goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.\n\nIs it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$.

        "description": "An online contest will soon be held on ForceCoders, a large competitive programming platform. The authors have prepared $n$ problems; and since the platform is very popular, $998244351$ coder from all over the world is going to solve them.\n\nFor each problem, the authors estimated the number of people who would solve it: for the $i$-th problem, the number of accepted solutions will be between $l_i$ and $r_i$, inclusive.\n\nThe creator of ForceCoders uses different criteria to determine if the contest is good or bad. One of these criteria is the number of inversions in the problem order. An inversion is a pair of problems $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is located earlier in the contest ($x < y$), but the number of accepted solutions for $y$ is strictly greater.\n\nObviously, both the creator of ForceCoders and the authors of the contest want the contest to be good. Now they want to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, assuming that for each problem $i$, any integral number of accepted solutions for it (between $l_i$ and $r_i$) is equally probable, and all these numbers are independent.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$) \u2014 the number of problems in the contest.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 998244351$) \u2014 the minimum and maximum number of accepted solutions for the $i$-th problem, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe probability that there will be no inversions in the contest can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is coprime with $998244353$.

Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.\n\nFor example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \\le l \\le r < 10^{18}, 1 \\le k \\le 10$) \u2014 the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10 50 2\n\nOutput\n1230\n\nInput\n1 2345 10\n\nOutput\n2750685\n\nInput\n101 154 2\n\nOutput\n2189\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} - \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.\n\nFor the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\\frac{2345 \\cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.\n\nFor the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.",

        "description": "Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.\n\nA year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.\n\nIn this problem you are given n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 24) \u2014 the number of integers.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 31) \u2014 the numbers you are to check.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print \"YES\" (without quotes).
