        "description": "You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich \u2014 a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! \n\n $m$ \n\nInitially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. \n\nYou can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.\n\nFor example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2013 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le x \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.\n\nThe following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \\le d_i, h_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the description of the $i$-th blow.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. \n\nIf Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $-1$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 10\n6 3\n8 2\n1 4\n4 10\n4 1\n3 2\n2 6\n1 100\n2 15\n10 11\n14 100\n\nOutput\n2\n3\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query you can deal the first blow (after that the number of heads changes to $10 - 6 + 3 = 7$), and then deal the second blow.\n\nIn the second query you just deal the first blow three times, and Zmei is defeated. \n\nIn third query you can not defeat Zmei Gorynich. Maybe it's better to convince it to stop fighting?",

However, she has to get an \u00abA\u00bb graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.\n\nIn school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to k. The worst mark is 1, the best is k. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8, 9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8, 8, 9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark k.\n\nNoora got n marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark k. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to k. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to k.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 k) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to k.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 10\n8 9\n\nOutput\n4\nInput\n3 5\n4 4 4\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first example testcase.\n\nMaximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks\u00a0\u2014 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \\frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate.",

As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.\n\nInnocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as \"the game is good for the imagination and attention\".\n\nHelp Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. \n\nFormally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each \u2014 the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character \".\" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character \"w\" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters \"+\" (the \"plus\" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as \"w\". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.\n\nIf the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 8\n..w..w..\n........\n........\n..w..w..\n\nOutput\n..w++w..\n..+..+..\n..+..+..\n..w++w..\n\nInput\n5 6\n......\n.w....\n......\n..w...\n......\n\nOutput\n......\n+w+...\n+.+...\n++w...\n......\n\nInput\n2 4\n....\n.w..\n\nOutput\n....\n.w..\n\nInput\n2 6\nw..w.w\n...w..\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4.

The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. \n\nThe rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 \u00d7 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.\n\nEach of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o).

Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l \u2014 left, s \u2014 straight, r \u2014 right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] \n\nAn accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.\n\nNow, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.\n\nEach line contains four integers l, s, r, p \u2014 for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively.

The $i$-th antenna lies on the position $x_i$ and has an initial scope of $s_i$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$.\n\nIt is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $1$, this operation costs $1$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).\n\nTo modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 80$ and $n \\le m \\le 100\\ 000$).\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \\le x_i \\le m$ and $0 \\le s_i \\le m$).\n\nOn each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nYou have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 595\n43 2\n300 4\n554 10\n\nOutput\n281\n\nInput\n1 1\n1 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n2 50\n20 0\n3 1\n\nOutput\n30\n\nInput\n5 240\n13 0\n50 25\n60 5\n155 70\n165 70\n\nOutput\n26\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, here is a possible strategy:\n\n  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$.

This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ \n\nTotal cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.\n\nNote that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.\n\n\u2014\n\nIn the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.\n\nNote that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.",

        "description": "It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! \n\nHowever, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 l \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x < y \u2264 l) \u2014 the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single non-negative integer v \u2014 the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.\n\nIn the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 l).

When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contain the players' description in four lines.

They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:\n\n  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \\leq x \\leq \\operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. \n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nYou're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).\n\nTo modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n#G#T#\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n6 1\nT....G\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n7 3\nT..#..G\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n6 2\n..GT..\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.",

Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.\n\nAndrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.\n\nFor example, consider the following string:  [Image] \n\nThis string can encode the message \u00abhappynewyear\u00bb. For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. \n\n [Image] \n\nPlease note that the same string can encode different messages.

The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\" (without the quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 100\n100 1\n99 99\n99 99\n\nOutput\nTeam 1\n\nInput\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\nTeam 2\n\nInput\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n\nOutput\nDraw\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).",
