        "description": "On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.\n\nSeating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. \n\nThe teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...\n\nThe order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.\n\nDuring the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. \n\nIf there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^18, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1 3 8 1 1\n\nOutput\n3 2 3\nInput\n4 2 9 4 2\n\nOutput\n2 1 1\nInput\n5 5 25 4 3\n\nOutput\n1 1 1\nInput\n100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100\n\nOutput\n101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; \n\nThe order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;",

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7k_{i} products.

After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years).

We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.\n\nAssuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 \u2264 v_1, v_2 \u2264 100) \u2014 the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains two integers t (2 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 \u2264 d \u2264 10) \u2014 the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 6\n4 2\n\nOutput\n26\nInput\n10 10\n10 0\n\nOutput\n100\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6.
