Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` has iterated through all indices from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference between any two adjacent numbers in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains as the first element of `arr`, and the loop index `i` will have gone through all possible pairs of consecutive elements in the list.
