After the loop has executed all its iterations, it will have compared every pair of consecutive elements in the list `arr` starting from the first element and updating `min_diff` whenever a smaller difference is found.

**Output State:** `arr` remains a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is still the first element of `arr`, and `i` will have completed its range up to `len(arr) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `min_diff` will contain the smallest difference found between each consecutive pair of numbers in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` will still hold the value of the first element of `arr`, and `i` will have gone through all valid indices from 1 to the last index of `arr`.
