Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` will still be the first element of `arr`, and the loop index `i` will have completed its final iteration, ending at the last valid index of the list, which is the length of `arr` minus one.
