Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the second-to-last element of `arr`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains as the first element of `arr` throughout the loop's execution. The variable `i` will have incremented to the index of the last element in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`). The variable `diff` will be the absolute difference between the last and second-to-last elements of `arr` after the final iteration of the loop.
