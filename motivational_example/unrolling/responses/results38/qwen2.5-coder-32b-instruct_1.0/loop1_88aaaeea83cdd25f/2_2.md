Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` has completed iterating from 1 to the last index of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains as the first element of `arr`, and the loop variable `i` will have gone through all indices from 1 to the end of the list.
