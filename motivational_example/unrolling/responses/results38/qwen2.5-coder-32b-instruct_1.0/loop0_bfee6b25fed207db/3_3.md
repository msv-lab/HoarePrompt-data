Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged; `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`; `temp` remains as the first element of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop runs, `arr` stays the same, `min_diff` will store the smallest difference found between the first element and any other element in the list, and `temp` will still be the first element of the list.
