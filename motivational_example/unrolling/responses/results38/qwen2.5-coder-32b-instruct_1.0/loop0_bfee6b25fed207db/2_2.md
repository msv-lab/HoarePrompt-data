Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`; `temp` remains the first element of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `arr` will still contain its original list of integers. The variable `min_diff` will store the smallest difference found between the first element of `arr` and any other element in the list. The variable `temp`, which initially held the first element of `arr`, will not change.
