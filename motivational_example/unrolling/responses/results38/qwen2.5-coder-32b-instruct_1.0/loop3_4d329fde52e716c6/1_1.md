After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between the first element of the array `arr` and any other element in the array. The variable `temp` will still hold the first element of `arr`, and `i` will have completed its range, which is from 1 to the length of `arr` minus one. The variable `diff` will hold the last calculated absolute difference, but it is not relevant to the final output state since `min_diff` will have been updated to reflect the smallest difference found throughout all iterations.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.**
