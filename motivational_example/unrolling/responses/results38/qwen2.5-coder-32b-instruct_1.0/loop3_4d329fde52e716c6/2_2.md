Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop are completed, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between the first element of the list `arr` and any other element in the list. The variable `temp` remains as the first element of `arr`, and the loop index `i` ends up being equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has iterated over every element in `arr` starting from the second element.
