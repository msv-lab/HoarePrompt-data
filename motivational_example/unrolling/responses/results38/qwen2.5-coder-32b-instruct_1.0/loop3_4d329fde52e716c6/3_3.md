Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference found between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `min_diff` holds the smallest difference between the first element of the array and any other element in the array. The variable `temp` remains as the first element of `arr`, and the loop index `i` will have incremented to match the length of the array, indicating that all elements have been compared.
