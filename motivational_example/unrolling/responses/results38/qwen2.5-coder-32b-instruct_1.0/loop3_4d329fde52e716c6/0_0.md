Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is `len(arr)`, and no further changes occur to `min_diff` or `temp`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between the first element of the array `arr` and any other element in the array. The variable `temp` will still be the first element of the array, and the loop index `i` will have reached the length of the array, indicating that all elements have been considered.
