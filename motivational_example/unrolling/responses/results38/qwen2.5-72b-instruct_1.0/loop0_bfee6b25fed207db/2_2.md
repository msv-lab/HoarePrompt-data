Output State: **The value of `min_diff` will be the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The value of `temp` remains the same as the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).
- For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the first element (`temp`).
- If this difference is smaller than the current value of `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to this new smaller difference.
- After the loop completes, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list.
- The value of `temp` does not change during the loop, so it remains the first element of `arr`.
