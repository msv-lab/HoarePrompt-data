Output State: **`min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, and `temp` remains the first element of `arr`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` will still be the first element of the list `arr`, as it is not modified within the loop.
