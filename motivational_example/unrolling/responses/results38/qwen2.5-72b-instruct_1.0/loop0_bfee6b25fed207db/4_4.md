Output State: **The value of `min_diff` will be the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The values of `arr` and `temp` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element.
- For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the first element stored in `temp`.
- If this difference is smaller than the current value of `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to this new, smaller difference.
- After the loop finishes, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference found between the first element and any other element in the list.
- The values of `arr` and `temp` are not modified by the loop.
