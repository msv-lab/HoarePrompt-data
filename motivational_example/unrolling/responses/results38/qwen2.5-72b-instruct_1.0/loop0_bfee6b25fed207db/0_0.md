Output State: **`min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, and `temp` remains the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the first element (`temp`). If this difference is smaller than the current value of `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated. After the loop completes, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list, while `temp` remains unchanged as the first element of `arr`.
