Output State: **`min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The value of `temp` remains the same as the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) and calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the first element (`temp`). It updates `min_diff` if the calculated difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`. After the loop finishes, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list. The value of `temp` does not change during the loop execution.
