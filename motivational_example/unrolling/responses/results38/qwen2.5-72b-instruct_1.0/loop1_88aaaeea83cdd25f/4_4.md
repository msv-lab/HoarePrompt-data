Output State: **`arr` remains a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and `temp`.**

### Explanation:
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is only used to compute differences.
- **`min_diff`**: After the loop completes, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
- **`temp`**: The variable `temp` remains the first element of `arr` because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the range `range(1, len(arr))`.
- **`diff`**: The variable `diff` will hold the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and `temp` (the first element of `arr`), but this value is only relevant for the last iteration. The final value of `min_diff` is determined by the smallest `diff` encountered during the loop.
