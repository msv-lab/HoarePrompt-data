Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`. If any of the differences calculated during the loop are smaller than the initial `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to the smallest of these differences.**
