Output State: **`arr` remains a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is the last calculated absolute difference between the last two elements processed in the loop.**

Explanation:
- `arr`: The original list of integers remains unchanged.
- `min_diff`: This variable holds the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.
- `temp`: This variable retains the value of the first element of `arr`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i`: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements from the second to the last.
- `diff`: This variable holds the absolute difference between the last two elements processed in the loop, which are the second-to-last and the last elements of `arr`.
