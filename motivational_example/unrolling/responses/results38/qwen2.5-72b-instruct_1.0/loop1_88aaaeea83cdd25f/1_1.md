Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the last index of `arr` minus 1 (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`). The variable `diff` is not defined outside the loop, but during the loop's execution, it was the absolute difference between the last two elements of `arr` that were compared.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- `min_diff` is updated to the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
- `temp` remains the first element of `arr` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` reaches the last index of `arr` minus 1 because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `diff` is not retained after the loop, but during the loop, it was used to store the absolute difference between consecutive elements.
