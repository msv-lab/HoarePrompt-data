Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `diff` is the last computed absolute difference, which is the absolute difference between the last and the second-to-last elements of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `arr`: The list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `min_diff`: After the loop completes, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
- `temp`: This variable remains the first element of `arr` throughout the loop, as it is not modified.
- `i`: The loop iterates from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`, so after the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `diff`: This variable holds the absolute difference between the last and the second-to-last elements of `arr` after the final iteration.
