Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any element in `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- `min_diff` is now the smallest absolute difference found between any element in `arr` and the first element of `arr`.
- `temp` remains the first element of `arr` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` reaches the value `len(arr) - 1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `arr` except the first one.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, which is the final comparison made in the loop.
