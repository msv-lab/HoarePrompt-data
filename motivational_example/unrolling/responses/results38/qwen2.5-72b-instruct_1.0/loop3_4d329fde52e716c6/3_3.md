Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any element in `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index of `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`. If `diff` is less than the current `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.**
