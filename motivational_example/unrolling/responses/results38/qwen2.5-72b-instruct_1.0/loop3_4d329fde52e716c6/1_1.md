Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any element in `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `temp` still holds the value of the first element of `arr`.
- The variable `i` has reached the last index of the loop, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variable `min_diff` now contains the smallest absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`.
