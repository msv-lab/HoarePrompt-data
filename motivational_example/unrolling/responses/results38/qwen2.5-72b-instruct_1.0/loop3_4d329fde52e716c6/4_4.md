Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any element in `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `temp` is still the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the last index of `arr` minus 1. The variable `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`. If this `diff` is less than the current `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to this `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` retains the smallest difference found during the loop.**
