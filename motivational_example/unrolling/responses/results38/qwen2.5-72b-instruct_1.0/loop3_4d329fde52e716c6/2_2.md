Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index of `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in the list, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`. If `diff` is less than the current `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated to `diff`; otherwise, `min_diff` remains the smallest difference found during the loop.**
