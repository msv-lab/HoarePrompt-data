Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the last index in the range from 1 to the length of `arr` minus one.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged as it holds the value of the first element of `arr`. The variable `i` will be the last index within the range specified by the loop, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
