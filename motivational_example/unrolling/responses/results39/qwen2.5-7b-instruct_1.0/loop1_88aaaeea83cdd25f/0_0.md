Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `temp` if `i` is less than the length of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` will still be the first element of the list, `i` will be the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared, and `diff` will be the last calculated difference, which should be equal to `min_diff`.
