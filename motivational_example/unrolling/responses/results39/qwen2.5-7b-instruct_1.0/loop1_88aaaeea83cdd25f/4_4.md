Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two adjacent elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index of `arr` minus one, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `temp` (which remains the first element of `arr`).**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` retains the value of the first element of `arr`, and `i` ends up being the second-to-last index of `arr`. The variable `diff` is no longer used but reflects the last comparison made, which is between `arr[i]` and `temp`.
