Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two adjacent elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index in the range (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`), and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last two elements of `arr` if `i` reaches the last index. `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr` after the loop completes.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `min_diff` will contain the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, while `temp` remains the first element of `arr`, `i` will be the last index considered in the loop, and `diff` will be the difference between the last two elements of `arr` if the loop fully iterates through the list.
