Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index in the range of `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the last two elements of `arr`. If any of the absolute differences between consecutive elements is smaller than `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated accordingly during each iteration.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged as it only holds the first element of `arr`, and `i` will be the index of the last element considered in the list, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
