Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in `arr` (where the first element is compared with all other elements), `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the last index value processed by the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between the first element of the list (`temp`) and any other element in the list. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating it has iterated through all elements of the list starting from the second one.
