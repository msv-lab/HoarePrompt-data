Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and any other element in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between the first element of the list (`temp`) and any other element in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged as it is only used to compare against other elements in the list. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `arr` after the last iteration of the loop.
