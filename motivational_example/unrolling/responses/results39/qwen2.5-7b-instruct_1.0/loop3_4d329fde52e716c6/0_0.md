Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` holds the smallest absolute difference between any two elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the last index value processed in the loop.**

In this final state, `min_diff` will contain the smallest absolute difference found between any two elements in the list `arr`. The variable `temp` retains the value of the first element of `arr` throughout the loop's execution, and `i` will be the index of the last element processed in the loop, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
