Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between the first element of `arr` and all other elements in `arr`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is the total length of `arr`. The variable `diff` has been calculated for each element in `arr` except the first one, and `min_diff` has been updated accordingly to reflect the smallest difference found.**

This final state indicates that the loop has iterated through all elements of `arr`, calculating the absolute difference between the first element (`temp`) and every other element, and updating `min_diff` to keep track of the smallest difference found throughout the iterations. After completing all iterations, `min_diff` will hold the minimum absolute difference between the first element of the list and all other elements.
