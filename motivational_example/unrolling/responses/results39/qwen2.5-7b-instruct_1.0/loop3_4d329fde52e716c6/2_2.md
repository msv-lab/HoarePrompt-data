Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two elements in `arr` where the first element is `temp`, `temp` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is the last index in the range of `len(arr)`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the element at index `i` and `temp`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest absolute difference between the first element of the list (`temp`) and any other element in the list. The value of `i` will be the last index that was checked, which is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` will be the difference between the last element of the list and `temp`, but importantly, it won't be used after the loop since the loop's logic updates `min_diff` based on the differences found during the loop iterations.
