Output State: **min_diff is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in arr starting from the second element, with temp holding the value of the first element of arr.**

In this output state, `min_diff` will store the minimum absolute difference found between each element in the list `arr` starting from the second element and the first element (`temp`). The variable `temp` remains unchanged and holds the value of the first element of the list `arr`.
