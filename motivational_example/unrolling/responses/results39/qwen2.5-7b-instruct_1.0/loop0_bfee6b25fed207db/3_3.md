Output State: `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, and `temp` remains as the value of the first element of `arr`.

This means that after the loop completes, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference found between any two consecutive numbers in the list starting from the second element onward, while `temp` retains its initial value, which is the first element of the list `arr`.
