Output State: `min_diff` contains the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, and `temp` still holds the value of the first element of `arr`.

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) and calculates the absolute difference between the current element and `temp` (which is the first element of the list). If this difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to this new smaller difference. After completing all iterations, `min_diff` will hold the smallest such difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list, while `temp` retains its initial value as it was not altered within the loop.
