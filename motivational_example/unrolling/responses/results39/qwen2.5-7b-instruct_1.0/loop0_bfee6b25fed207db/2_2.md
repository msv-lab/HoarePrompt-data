Output State: `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, with `temp` being the first element of `arr`.

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) and calculates the absolute difference between the current element and `temp`. If this difference is smaller than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated. After the loop completes, `min_diff` will hold the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list, and `temp` will still be the first element of `arr` as it was initially set and not modified within the loop.
