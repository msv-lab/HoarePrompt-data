Output State: **The variable `min_diff` contains the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, starting from the second element with the first element (`temp`).**

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `min_diff` will hold the minimum absolute difference found between each element in the list `arr` starting from the second element and the first element (`temp`). All other variables remain unchanged.
