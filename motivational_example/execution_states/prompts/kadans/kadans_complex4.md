I am giving you a problem description and the solution in python, with correct execution states of the program as comments. Is the solution correct?

# Problem:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, such that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side.
def func_1(a, b, c):
    if (a == b or b == c or a == c) :
        if (abs(a * a + b * b - c * c) != 0 and abs(a * a + c * c - b * b) != 0) :
            #State: At least two of the sides (a, b, or c) are equal.  \( |a^2 + b^2 - c^2| != 0 \) and also \( |a^2 + c^2 - b^2| != 0 \).
            return 'isosceles'
        #State: At least two of the sides (a, b, or c) are equal. Either \( |a^2 + b^2 - c^2| = 0 \) or \( |a^2 + c^2 - b^2| = 0 \).
        return 'right isosceles'.
    #State:Sides  a, b, and c are all distinct (i.e., no two sides are equal).
    return 'triangle'
