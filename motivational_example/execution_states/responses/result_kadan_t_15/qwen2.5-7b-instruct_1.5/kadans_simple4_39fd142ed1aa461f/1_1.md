The provided solution looks correct and implements a variant of the Kadane's algorithm adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers. Let's break down the logic to ensure it works as expected.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` track the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
   
2. **Loop through the array:**
   - For each number `num`, calculate the new possible `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - The key idea is that the maximum product ending at the current position can come from either the current number itself, the product of the previous maximum product and the current number (when we continue the existing sequence), or the product of the previous minimum product and the current number (when a large negative number can flip the sign).

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's consider some edge cases:
- **Empty List:** The function correctly returns `-inf` when the input list is empty.
- **Single Element List:** It handles a single element list correctly.
- **List with All Positive Numbers:** It should return the product of all elements.
- **List with Both Positive and Negative Numbers:** It should handle sequences that include negative numbers which can produce larger products when two negatives multiply together.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Input:** `[2, 3, -2, 4]`
   - The maximum product sublist would be `[2, 3, -2, 4]` which has a product of `24`.

2. **Input:** `[-2, 0, -1]`
   - The maximum product sublist would be `[-2, 0, -1]` which has a product of `0` due to the presence of `0`.

3. **Input:** `[-2, -3, -4]`
   - The maximum product sublist would be `[-2, -3, -4]` which has a product of `24`.

4. **Input:** `[-2, 0, 2, 4]`
   - The maximum product sublist would be `[-2, 2, 4]` which has a product of `16`.

Based on these checks and reasoning, the given Python code seems to be correct and well-designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist.
