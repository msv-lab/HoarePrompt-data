Let's analyze the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Solution Analysis:

The given solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at each position. This is crucial because the maximum product subarray can either be extended from a previous subarray (by multiplying with the current element) or be a new subarray starting at the current element (if it's better).

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall best product seen so far.

2. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second one):
     - `temp` computes the potential new value if we extend the current `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` updates to the maximum of:
       - The current number (`num`), 
       - The potential new maximum value (`temp`), 
       - And the new minimum value when multiplied by `num` (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` updates to the minimum of:
       - The current number (`num`),
       - The potential new minimum value (`temp`), 
       - And the new minimum value when multiplied by `num` (`min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - At the end of each iteration, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` has a better product than the previously recorded `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Conclusion:
The logic correctly handles the case where negative numbers can turn large products into very small ones and vice versa, making sure to track both the maximum and minimum possible products at each step.

### Execution State Comments:
```python
# Example 1: [2, 3, -2, 4]
# Initial values:
# xs[0] = 2
# min_ending_here = 2
# max_ending_here = 2
# best_so_far = 2

# Iteration 1: num = 3
# temp = 6
# max_ending_here = 6 (since 3 < 6 < 6)
# min_ending_here = 3 (since 3 < 6 < 6)

# Iteration 2: num = -2
# temp = -12
# max_ending_here = 3 (since -2 < 3 < -12)
# min_ending_here = -12 (since -2 < 3 < -12)

# Iteration 3: num = 4
# temp = -48
# max_ending_here = 12 (since 4 > -48 > -12)
# min_ending_here = -48 (since 4 > -48 > -12)

# Final best_so_far is 12

# Example 2: [0, 2]
# Initial values:
# xs[0] = 0
# min_ending_here = 0
# max_ending_here = 0
# best_so_far = 0

# Iteration 1: num = 2
# temp = 0
# max_ending_here = 2 (since 2 > 0 > 0)
# min_ending_here = 0 (since 2 > 0 > 0)

# Final best_so_far is 2
```

The algorithm correctly handles edge cases such as zeros and negative numbers.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
