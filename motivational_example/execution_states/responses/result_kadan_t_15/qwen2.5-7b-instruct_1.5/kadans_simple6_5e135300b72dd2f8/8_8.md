Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list. The algorithm works by keeping track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, which allows handling negative numbers effectively.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. **Loop through the List**: For each element in the list (starting from the second one):
   - It calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
3. **Update Best So Far**: After processing each number, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
4. **Return Best So Far**: Finally, it returns `best_so_far`.

### Edge Cases
- An empty list should return `-inf` because the product of no elements is undefined and negative infinity is the lowest possible value.
- The algorithm correctly handles sequences that include negative numbers by considering both the current element and the minimum product so far when calculating the new `max_ending_here`.

### Correctness

After reviewing the logic and the edge cases, the implementation appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray. The algorithm ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled properly.

### Conclusion
The program provided is **Correct**.

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Thus, the answer is **Correct**.
