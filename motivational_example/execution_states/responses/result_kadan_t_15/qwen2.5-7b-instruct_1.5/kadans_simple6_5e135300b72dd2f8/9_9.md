Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Code Breakdown

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

- **Loop through the list**:
  - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), calculate three possible products:
    - The current number (`num`) itself.
    - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`).
    - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values. This handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is always tracked properly.

  - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of these three values, which is important for maintaining the context of potential new maximums when encountering negative numbers.

- **Update best_so_far**:
  - After the loop, ensure that `max_ending_here` (which might still have old value) is compared with `best_so_far`, and if it's greater, update `best_so_far`.

### Test Cases

To validate correctness, we can run some test cases:

1. **Empty List**:
   ```python
   assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')
   ```

2. **Single Element List**:
   ```python
   assert func_1([5]) == 5
   ```

3. **List with Negative Numbers**:
   ```python
   assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == 12  # Products: -1, 2, -6, 24 -> Max is 24
   ```

4. **List with Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   ```python
   assert func_1([-1, -2, 0, 2, 3]) == 18  # Products: -1, 2, 0, 6, 18 -> Max is 18
   ```

### Conclusion

Based on the logic and the test cases, the function correctly handles all edge cases and computes the maximum product of any sublist. Thus, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
