The given solution is correct. The program logic for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers is implemented properly using dynamic programming principles. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works correctly based on the provided comments:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - If `max_ending_here` after processing the current number is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `float('-inf')` to indicate that no product can be computed.

Therefore, the given solution should work as expected for the described problem. So, the response:

Correctness: **True**
