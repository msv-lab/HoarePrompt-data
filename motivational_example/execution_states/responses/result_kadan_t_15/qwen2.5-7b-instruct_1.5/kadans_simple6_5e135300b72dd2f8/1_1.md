Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The algorithm uses dynamic programming concepts to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at each position, which helps handle cases where negative numbers can turn a previously small product into a large one and vice versa. The comments in the code outline the steps correctly and the logic follows a well-known approach for this type of problem. Therefore, the solution is correct.
