Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. This is typically solved using a variation of Kadane's algorithm, adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers efficiently.

Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. These variables track the minimum, maximum product ending at the current position, and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively.

2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each number, it calculates a temporary value by multiplying the current `max_ending_here` with the current number (`temp = max_ending_here * num`).
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, the temporary value (`temp`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This handles cases where a negative number might make the previous product negative but a subsequent one could turn it into a large positive number.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values: the current number itself, the temporary value (`temp`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This ensures that in case of negative numbers, the function can still keep track of the smallest possible product to reverse it if needed.

3. **Update Best Result**: If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This approach works for lists containing both positive and negative integers, including handling cases with zero.
