The given program is actually correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down why it works and verify its correctness with some reasoning and test cases.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position because when we encounter a negative number later, multiplying it with a small (current) negative product can result in a large positive product.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` stores the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one, the program updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
   - `temp` calculates the intermediate product which is useful in determining both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Updating Values**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number, the intermediate product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This handles both the case where the maximum product is formed by continuing the current chain and the case where it switches to starting anew.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to keep track of the minimum product to help flip from a negative to a positive product in the future.

4. **Result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Test Cases

Let's validate this implementation with a few test cases:

```python
def test_max_subarray_product():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # Maximum product sublist is [2, 3] or [-2, 4]
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0     # The product including 0 is zero
    assert func_1([-2, 3, -4]) == 24    # Maximum product sublist is [-2, 3, -4]
    assert func_1([0, 2, -3, -2, 4, -1]) == 48  # Maximum product sublist is [0, 2, -3, -2, 4]
    assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == 24  # Maximum product is the product of all numbers
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')    # Empty list should give -inf
    assert func_1([0, 0, 0]) == 0         # All zeros give zero

test_max_subarray_product()
```

If the above test cases pass without any assertion errors, the function is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the reasoning and test cases provided, the solution is correct. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
