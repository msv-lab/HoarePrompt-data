To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

The goal is to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The approach here is using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one and vice versa.

### Explanation of the Code

- `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far across the list.

### Logic Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list:
     - Compute `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - `num` (the current element).
       - `temp` (product of previous max and current element).
       - `min_ending_here * num` (product of previous min and current element). This helps handle the case where a negative number turns a small positive product into a large one.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - `num` (the current element).
       - `temp` (product of previous max and current element).
       - `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Result**:
   - After iterating through all elements, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any sublist.

### Testing the Solution:

Let's test the function with some inputs to see if it works correctly.

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]))  # Expected output: 6
```

### Correctness Check:

Based on the logic and the expected behavior, the function seems to be correctly implementing the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately, including cases where zero might be involved.

Thus, the provided code should work correctly for the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is indeed correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist.
