### Explanation

The given program aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a list of integers (`xs`). Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum product of the sublist ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, representing the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code computes three values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This calculates the product of the maximum product up to the previous element with the current element.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Here, the code updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element (`num`)
       - The product of the maximum product up to the previous element (`max_ending_here`) with the current element (`temp`)
       - The product of the minimum product up to the previous element (`min_ending_here`) with the current element.
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the same three values.

3. **Updating the best solution**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the code checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

This algorithm works because it considers both positive and negative numbers. When multiplying by a negative number, the sign can change, making what was a minimum product into a potential maximum product, and vice versa. The algorithm maintains the minimum product as well as the maximum to handle these cases.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct for finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. It effectively handles all edge cases, including lists with all negative numbers, all positive numbers, and mixed numbers.

### Correctness: **True**
