Let's reason through the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

The goal of the function `func_1` is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list `xs`. The algorithm seems to follow a dynamic programming approach where we maintain the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is initialized with the first element of `xs`.
   - `max_ending_here`: Keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position. This is also initialized with the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far. This is initially set to the first element of `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, calculate:
     - `temp`: The intermediate value which is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`). 
       - This accounts for both positive and negative products, which might turn around to provide a new higher maximum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Update the best-so-far product**:
   - After processing all numbers, check if the last computed `max_ending_here` is greater than the `best_so_far` and update it if necessary.

4. **Return the best-so-far product**:
   - Return the value of `best_so_far`.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly handles all scenarios:

- **Handling zero**: If a zero is encountered in the middle of the list, the product of any subarray including that zero will be zero, so the algorithm needs to skip over such zeros to continue tracking meaningful subarray products.
- **Multiple zeros**: The algorithm can correctly handle multiple zeros because when `min_ending_here` becomes zero due to a series of zeros, subsequent products involving non-zero numbers could again lead to a new highest product.
- **Positive vs Negative numbers**: By maintaining both the minimum and maximum ending products, the algorithm can switch between positive and negative numbers effectively and always keep track of the highest possible product.

Considering all these points, the implementation appears to handle various edge cases and general cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
