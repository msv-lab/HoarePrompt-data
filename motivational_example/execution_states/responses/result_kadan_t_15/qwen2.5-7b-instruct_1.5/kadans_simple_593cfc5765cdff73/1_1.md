### Reasoning:

To determine whether the provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list, we need to analyze how it works and compare it against what would be required to solve the problem accurately.

The key idea behind finding the maximum product sublist can be summarized as follows:
1. **Track Maximum and Minimum Ending at Each Position**: This is because the minimum product ending at one point could become a maximum when multiplied by a negative number.
2. **Keep Track of the Best So Far**: The best product found during the iteration should be updated whenever a new candidate with a larger product is found.

Let's break down the provided function step-by-step:

1. **Initial Checks**: It correctly handles an empty list, returning \(-\infty\), indicating that the empty list should give the smallest possible product (which doesn't affect the maximum non-empty product).

2. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list (`num`):
   - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of the current maximum product ending here (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated using the logic that it could come from three sources:
     - The current number itself.
     - The temporary value which might be larger if the current number is positive.
     - The product of the previous minimum product ending here and the current number which might bring in a negative contribution and thus increase the potential maximum product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated considering all three cases but with the logic flipped due to the need to handle negative products correctly.
   
4. **Best Update**: At each step, `best_so_far` is updated if the newly computed `max_ending_here` provides a better result.

This approach effectively captures the dynamic nature of the product calculation by maintaining both maximum and minimum products at each step. This way, even if the product sequence starts decreasing, a sudden negative number can turn a low product into a high one (as seen in the multiplication of two negatives), or vice versa.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided function seems to follow the correct logic to solve the problem accurately. It maintains both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, updating the best product accordingly.
