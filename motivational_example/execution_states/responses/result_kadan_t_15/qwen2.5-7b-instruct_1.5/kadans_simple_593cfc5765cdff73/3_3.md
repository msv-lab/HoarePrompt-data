Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist from the given integer list.

### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-infinity` which is appropriate because there is no product to compute.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element, we need to consider the product of the current `max_ending_here` with the next number and also the minimum and maximum values of the product considering the previous minimum and maximum ending at the current position.

4. **Key Calculation**:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This considers extending the current maximum product.
   - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among three options: the current number alone, extending the previous maximum product, and extending the previous minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
   - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum value among three options.

5. **Update Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, we ensure that `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum between itself and `max_ending_here`.

### Edge Cases:
- The algorithm correctly handles lists with all negative numbers or zeros. It ensures that the maximum product will still be found even when multiple negatives are encountered.

### Verification:
- The logic correctly considers both positive and negative numbers and zeros, ensuring the highest possible product is returned by properly tracking both local minimum and maximum values as we iterate through the list.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the program, we can conclude that the logic and handling of all edge cases seem to be correct. Therefore, the program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist from the given integer list.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
