Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Explanation:

The given function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the input list `xs`. This is a classic problem that can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of two variables at each step:
1. `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of the subarray that ends at the current position.
2. `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of the subarray that ends at the current position (this helps handle the case when the current number is negative and flips the maximum and minimum products).

The idea is that for each element in the list, the new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` will depend on the following possibilities:
- Starting a new subarray with the current element.
- Extending the previous subarray by including the current element.
- Flipping the sign of the previous subarray because of a negative number.

### Key Points to Check:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are correctly set to the first element of the list.
2. **Loop Logic**: The loop correctly updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` by considering the possibilities mentioned.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles empty lists correctly by returning `float('-inf')`.

### Verification:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = xs[0]`
   - `max_ending_here = xs[0]`
   - `best_so_far = xs[0]`

2. **Loop**:
   - For each `num` in `xs[1:]`, the logic inside the loop is correct:
     ```python
     temp = max_ending_here * num
     max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
     min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
     ```
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered at each step.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, `max_ending_here` is checked against `best_so_far` to update it if necessary.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the list is empty, the function returns `float('-inf')`, which is correct as there are no subarrays to compute the product from.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to follow the correct logic and handles the problem as described. It appropriately considers edge cases like an empty list and updates the `best_so_far` variable using the correct approach.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
