To reason about the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and verify whether it satisfies the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given list of integers. This requires handling both positive and negative numbers appropriately since a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large negative one, and vice versa.

### Program Breakdown
1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the list is empty (`xs`), the function returns `float('-inf')`, indicating no product can be calculated (which correctly handles the edge case of an empty list).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element.
   - `max_ending_here` is initialized to the first element.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the highest product found so far.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - Inside the loop:
     - A temporary value `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum value among three possibilities:
       - The current number itself.
       - `temp` (the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (since this could potentially change the sign if the current number is negative).
     - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum value among these three possibilities, ensuring it captures the smallest possible negative product when needed.

4. **Final Update**:
   - At each iteration, if the newly calculated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The final `best_so_far` value is returned.

### Reasoning for Correctness
- The approach effectively considers both the current value and the product of previously considered values, along with their products, allowing it to correctly handle sequences with negative numbers.
- By maintaining both the maximum and minimum product that end at each position, it can switch between them dynamically when encountering negative numbers.
- This ensures that the overall strategy is robust for all possible input cases.

### Conclusion
Based on the above reasoning, the provided code implements the required functionality correctly. It accurately finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
