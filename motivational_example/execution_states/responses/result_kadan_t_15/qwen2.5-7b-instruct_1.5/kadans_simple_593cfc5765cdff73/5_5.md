To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze its logic and compare it with a standard approach to solving this problem.

### Analysis:

The problem requires finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The key challenge here is that the presence of negative numbers can potentially reverse the product's sign and thus could make an otherwise low product turn into a high one.

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the input list `xs`.

- **Loop through the list**:
  - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`num`), we calculate three values:
    1. `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
    2. `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
    3. `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

- **Update `best_so_far`**:
  - If the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then update `best_so_far`.

### Reasoning:

- **Handling Negative Numbers**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where multiplying a negative number to a very small (potentially negative) product can yield a large positive product.
  
- **State Management**:
  - `max_ending_here` tracks the highest product we can get ending at the current index considering both the current number alone and the effect of previous elements on it.
  - `min_ending_here` ensures that even if the sequence starts negatively but has subsequent numbers making the product large, we capture that.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - When `xs` is empty, it returns `-inf`, which is the expected behavior for an edge case where no products can be computed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It properly manages negative numbers and ensures the tracking of the maximum possible product subarray.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
