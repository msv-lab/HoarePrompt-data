Let's reason about the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input.
   - It initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both set to the first element of `xs`.
     - `best_so_far` also set to the first element of `xs`.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The program then iterates through the rest of the elements in the list (from the second element).
   - For each element, a temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).

3. **Updating Values**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated using the maximum value among:
     - The current number (`num`).
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
   - This is to handle cases where a negative number multiplied by a small negative number can produce a large positive product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated using the minimum value among:
     - The current number (`num`).
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

4. **Storing Best Result**:
   - After updating the values, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are compared with `best_so_far` to ensure that the overall best product so far is stored.

5. **Returning Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

### Reasoning

The approach described is known as the Kadane's algorithm, but adapted for finding the maximum product of any sublist. It keeps track of the current minimum and maximum products ending at each position, which is crucial for handling cases with multiple consecutive negative numbers, as their product can become a positive maximum.

### Testing the Implementation

To confirm correctness, we can test the function with different cases:
- Empty list.
- Single element.
- Positive elements.
- Negative elements.
- Combination of positive and negative elements.

### Conclusion

Given the nature of the algorithm and the test cases it handles well, the implementation seems logically sound. However, without running through specific edge cases, one must be cautious.

Based on the explanation and common understanding of this algorithm, the provided program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
