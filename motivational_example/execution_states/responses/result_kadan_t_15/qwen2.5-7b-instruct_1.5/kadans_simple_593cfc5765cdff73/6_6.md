Let's reason through the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description
We need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given list of integers.

### Explanation of the Code
- The function `func_1` initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`. These variables track the minimum and maximum product ending at each position and the overall best product found so far.
- We iterate through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
- For each number `num` in the list:
  - We calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - We update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - After each iteration, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

### Analysis
The core idea of this approach is that the product of a subarray can flip from positive to negative or vice versa based on whether an even or odd number of negative numbers are included. This algorithm accounts for both scenarios:

- If the current number is positive, the new maximum product will be either the current number itself or the product of the previous maximum and the current number (if it results in a larger value), and the new minimum product will be the product of the previous minimum and the current number (if it results in a smaller value).
- If the current number is negative, the new maximum product can become the product of the previous minimum and the current number (because a negative times a negative is positive), and the new minimum product will be either the current number or the product of the previous maximum and the current number (which might make the product negative).

This method ensures that we consider both the maximum and minimum products at each step, thus capturing all possible subarrays, especially those containing multiple negative numbers.

### Correctness Check
After analyzing the logic, the implementation correctly handles edge cases like when the list contains only one element, multiple negatives, and zero. It also appropriately updates the `best_so_far` variable.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the provided code meets the requirements of finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the given list.

**Correctness: True**
