The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the input list `xs`.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, as the initial best product we know is just the product of the first element itself.

- **Iterate through the list starting from the second element:**
  - For each number `num` in the list, calculate the following possibilities:
    - The product if we consider only `num` (i.e., `num`).
    - The product with the current `max_ending_here` and the new number.
    - The product with the current `min_ending_here` and the new number.
  
  These calculations are used to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

- **Update the global best result**:
  - After processing each number, if `max_ending_here` becomes greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

- **Return the result**:
  - Finally, return the `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Example Test Case:
Let's test the function with a sample input to ensure its correctness.

```python
def test_max_product_sublist():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # The subarray [2, 3] has the largest product = 6
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0    # The product is 0 because of the 0 in the middle
    assert func_1([-2, 3, -4]) == 24   # The subarray [-2, 3, -4] has the largest product = 24
    assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]) == 6  # The subarray [-1, -2, -3] has the largest product = 6
    assert func_1([0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0    # All elements are 0, so the maximum product is 0

test_max_product_sublist()
```

### Conclusion:
Based on the explanation and the example tests, the function `func_1` should solve the given problem correctly. It efficiently handles various edge cases including lists containing negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.
