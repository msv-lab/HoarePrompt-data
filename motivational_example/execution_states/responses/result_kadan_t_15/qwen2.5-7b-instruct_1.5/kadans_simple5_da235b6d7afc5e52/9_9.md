Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables track the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - The new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated as follows:
       - `max_ending_here` is set to the maximum of:
         - `num`: Starting a new sublist from the current number.
         - `temp`: Continuing with the previous max product and multiplying by the current number.
         - `min_ending_here * num`: Continuing with the previous min product and multiplying by the current number (this handles cases where multiplying a negative number can change min to max).
       - `min_ending_here` is set to the minimum of:
         - `num`: Starting a new sublist from the current number.
         - `temp`: Continuing with the previous max product and multiplying by the current number.
         - `min_ending_here * num`: Continuing with the previous min product and multiplying by the current number (this handles cases where multiplying a negative number can change max to min).

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After processing each number, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly, as seen in the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. Here is the code with comments for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary product to handle updates
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
