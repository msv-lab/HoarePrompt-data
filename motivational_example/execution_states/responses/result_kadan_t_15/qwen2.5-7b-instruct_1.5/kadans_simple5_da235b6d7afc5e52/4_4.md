Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` (negative infinity), indicating that the maximum product is negative infinity when there are no elements to consider.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here`: Keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position (this is useful because a large negative number can become very positive when multiplied by another negative number).
   - `max_ending_here`: Keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iteration**: The function then iterates through the list starting from the second element:
   - For each number `num`, it calculates the potential new value of `max_ending_here` considering:
     - The current number `num` itself,
     - The product of the previous `max_ending_here` and `num`,
     - The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` considering these possibilities.
   
4. **Update Best Result**: After processing each number, it updates `best_so_far` if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found in the input list.

This algorithm efficiently handles the problem using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. It effectively considers both positive and negative numbers, which is crucial since the product of two negative numbers can yield a positive product that might be the maximum.
