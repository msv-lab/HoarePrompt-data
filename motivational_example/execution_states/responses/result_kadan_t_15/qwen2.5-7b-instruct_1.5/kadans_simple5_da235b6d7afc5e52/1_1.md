The provided solution does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. The approach used here is efficient and clever, leveraging the concept of dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position.

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `max_ending_here` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list as well.

- **Iterate through the list** (starting from the second element):
  - For each number, calculate the potential new maximum and minimum products ending at the current position.
  - `temp = max_ending_here * num` calculates the new possible maximum if we were to multiply the current maximum with the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, `temp`, or the minimum ending product so far multiplied by the current number. This covers the possibility that multiplying with the minimum can result in the maximum due to negative numbers.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly, but it's kept minimal, as we're tracking the smallest possible value to maximize future multiplications.

- **Return**:
  - After iterating through the entire list, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the highest product found.

### Example:

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = max(3, 6, -6) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = min(3, 6, -6) = -6`
   - Now, `best_so_far = 6`

3. **Second iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = max(-2, -12, 12) = 12`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = min(-2, -12, 12) = -12`
   - Now, `best_so_far = 6`

4. **Third iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * 4 = 48`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, 48, min_ending_here * 4) = max(4, 48, -48) = 48`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, 48, min_ending_here * 4) = min(4, 48, -48) = -48`
   - Now, `best_so_far = 48`

5. **Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far = 48`.

Thus, this implementation correctly handles all edge cases, including sequences with negative numbers that can produce large positive products by alternating signs. The provided solution is correct and efficient.
