The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness:

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of:
    - `min_ending_here`: the minimum product ending at the current position (considering both positive and negative numbers).
    - `max_ending_here`: the maximum product ending at the current position.
    - `best_so_far`: the best (maximum) product found so far across all possible sublists.

- **Loop through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`):**
  - For each number in the list:
    - `temp` is used to store the product if the previous maximum product ends here.
    - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three possibilities:
      1. The current number itself (`num`).
      2. The product of the current number and the previous maximum product ending here (`max_ending_here` * `num`).
      3. The product of the current number and the previous minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here` * `num`), because multiplying a negative number with a negative minimum can result in a large positive number.
    - `min_ending_here` is similarly updated to be the minimum of these three possibilities.
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated.

- **Return the final result:**
  - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider a few examples:

#### Example 1:
```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```
- Iteration 1: 
  - num = 3, max_ending_here = max(3, 6, -6) = 6, min_ending_here = min(3, 6, -6) = -6
- Iteration 2:
  - num = -2, max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 12) = 12, min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 12) = -12
- Iteration 3:
  - num = 4, max_ending_here = max(4, 48, -48) = 48, min_ending_here = min(4, 48, -48) = -48

Result: `max_ending_here = 48` which is the maximum product of any sublist `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

#### Example 2:
```python
xs = [-2, 0, -1]
```
- Iteration 1:
  - num = 0, max_ending_here = max(0, 0, 0) = 0, min_ending_here = min(0, 0, 0) = 0
- Iteration 2:
  - num = -1, max_ending_here = max(-1, 0, 0) = 0, min_ending_here = min(-1, 0, 0) = -1

Result: `max_ending_here = 0` which is the maximum product of any sublist `[0]` or empty product.

#### Example 3:
```python
xs = [-1, -2, -3, 0]
```
- Iteration 1:
  - num = -2, max_ending_here = max(-2, 2, 2) = 2, min_ending_here = min(-2, 2, 2) = -2
- Iteration 2:
  - num = -3, max_ending_here = max(-3, -6, 6) = 6, min_ending_here = min(-3, -6, 6) = -6
- Iteration 3:
  - num = 0, max_ending_here = max(0, 0, 0) = 0, min_ending_here = min(0, 0, 0) = 0

Result: `max_ending_here = 6` which is the maximum product of any sublist `[-1, -2, -3]`.

Based on these examples and the explanation, the provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
