The provided Python function `func_1` indeed solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down the logic to confirm its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the input list `xs`. This helps manage the state for both positive and negative numbers effectively.

2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element. For each number:
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
     - The current number itself.
     - `temp`, which accounts for the case where the previous maximum could have been part of a larger product (positive number).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number, which might help turn a previously small product into a large one (if multiplying by a large negative number turns it positive).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
     - The current number itself.
     - `temp`.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number, which helps maintain the smallest product to catch negative number sequences.

3. **Update Best Result**: After each iteration, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach ensures that even when the sequence includes negative numbers, the code can track both the maximum and minimum products to handle cases like `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, where the product of a negative sublist can still yield a maximum value.

### Example Usage:
```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
```

This output is correct because the maximum product subarray here is `[2, 3]` or `[-2, 4]`, and their product is 6.

Therefore, the provided solution correctly addresses the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist.
