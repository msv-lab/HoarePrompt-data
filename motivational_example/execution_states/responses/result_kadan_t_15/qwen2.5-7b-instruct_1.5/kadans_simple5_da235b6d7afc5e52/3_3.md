The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness:

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both start with the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` also starts with the first element, as this is our current best product seen so far.

2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the function computes three potential products:
     - `num` itself.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:**
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the above three values. This ensures that we're considering both positive and negative numbers to maximize the product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the above three values to handle cases where we encounter large negative numbers and need to switch to maximizing again.

4. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it's compared with `best_so_far`, and if it's greater, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to see how the function works:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
result = func_1(xs)
print(result)  # Output should be 6, since the sublist [2, 3] has the maximum product.
```

In this case, the function will iterate through the list and at some point update the `best_so_far` value to 6, which comes from the sublist `[2, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem. It effectively handles cases where the sequence includes negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product can still be found even when negative elements are involved. Thus, it satisfies the requirements of the problem.
