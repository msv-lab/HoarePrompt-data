The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `float('-inf')`. This is a common way to handle empty lists, indicating that no valid product can be computed.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`.

3. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The function iterates over each element in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   
4. **Updating Variables**:
   - For each number in the list, three possibilities are considered to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
     - The current number itself.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - These possibilities account for the effect of multiplying a positive or negative number on both the potential maximum and minimum products up to the current point.

5. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

6. **Return Statement**:
   - The function finally returns `best_so_far`, which will be the maximum product found.

### Example:

Let's consider an example with the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initial values: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- For the next number `3`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
- For the next number `-2`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * -2 = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
- For the last number `4`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, min_ending_here * 4) = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, min_ending_here * 4) = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`

Finally, `best_so_far` is updated to `24`, and the function returns `24`.

This approach ensures that we can handle lists with both positive and negative numbers, as the minimum and maximum products are tracked simultaneously to accommodate the effect of sign changes. Thus, the provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist.
