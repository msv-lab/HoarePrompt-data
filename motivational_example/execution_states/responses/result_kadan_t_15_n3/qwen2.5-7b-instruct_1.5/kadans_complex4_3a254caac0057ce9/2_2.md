The provided solution looks correct and addresses the given problem statement effectively. Let's break down the solution to verify its correctness:

### Analysis

**Objective**: Find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given list of integers.

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Base Case Check**: 
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty, returning negative infinity since the product of an empty list should be considered the lowest possible value.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position (useful for negative numbers).
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: The maximum product found so far, initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num

       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` stores the intermediate product which is the multiplication of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` updates to the maximum among the current number, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. 
     - `num` could potentially become the start of a new sublist with a high positive product.
     - `temp` represents extending the current sublist.
     - `min_ending_here * num` considers the effect of multiplying by a large negative number which might flip the sign and become the new max or min.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` updates to the minimum among the current number, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   Updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the previously best found value.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Example Cases

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`
  - Output: `6` (Sublist `[2, 3]`)
  - The solution correctly identifies that the maximum product comes from the sublist `[2, 3]`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `xs = [-2, 0, -1]`
  - Output: `0` (Sublist `[0]`)
  - The solution correctly identifies that including `0` in any product makes it zero, so the maximum product is zero.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `xs = [-1, -2, -3, 0]`
  - Output: `6` (Sublist `[-1, -2, -3]`)
  - The solution correctly identifies that the maximum product is the one obtained from the negative values multiplied together, considering they turn into a positive product when more numbers are included.

Given the analysis and examples, the provided solution appears to be both correct and efficient. There are no apparent flaws or logical errors.
