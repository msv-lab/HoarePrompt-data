The solution provided appears to be mostly correct, but there is a minor issue in the logic within the `for` loop where the intermediate variable `temp` is defined. The variable `temp` can be removed to simplify the logic, which also clarifies the process. Let's re-examine and correct the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf when the input list is empty
    
    # Initialize the variables to store the current minimum and maximum products ending at the current element
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the new minimum and maximum ending products based on the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

    # Update the best so far if the max ending product is better
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Loop through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each element `num` in `xs[1:]`, we need to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on three possible scenarios:
     - Using just `num` (i.e., starting a new sublist),
     - Continuing the existing sublist using `max_ending_here * num`,
     - Continuing the existing sublist but flipping the sign using `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the `best_so_far`**:
   - If the newly calculated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - After processing all elements, return `best_so_far`.

This approach correctly handles edge cases like negative numbers in the list, ensuring that the algorithm accounts for both large and small values contributing to the maximum product. 

Here's a test case to verify the correctness:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
print(func_1([-2]))           # Expected output: -2
```

These test cases should confirm that the function works as intended.
