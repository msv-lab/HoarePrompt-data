The given solution appears to be mostly correct, but there's a small issue with the logic inside the `for` loop that can be optimized. The current code might sometimes miss updating `min_ending_here` correctly, which is critical for finding the maximum product. Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Update min_ending_here and max_ending_here using the same expression
        min_ending_here, max_ending_here = min(num, min_ending_here * num, max_ending_here * num), \
                                           max(num, min_ending_here * num, max_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far only once per iteration, if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values:** `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop through List:** For each subsequent element in `xs`, we update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` by comparing three possible products:
  - The current element (`num`) itself,
  - The product of `num` and `min_ending_here` (since the minimum product ending at the previous element could lead to a larger negative product when multiplied by a negative number),
  - The product of `num` and `max_ending_here` (since the maximum product ending at the previous element could lead to an even larger positive product).

This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the smallest product ending at the current position, and `max_ending_here` always holds the largest product ending at the current position.

### Example Execution:
Let's run through an example to verify:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (Sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (Sublist [0])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]))# Expected output: 6 (Sublist [-1, -2, -3])
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```

The provided solution should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist for various input cases.
