The provided solution seems to be addressing the problem correctly, but there are some issues in the logic that need to be addressed. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_ending_here` needs to be corrected. Let's walk through the solution and correct it.

Hereâ€™s the revised annotated version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    
    # State: `xs` is a non-empty list of integers
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: At this point, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the second-to-last element
        # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the second-to-last element
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

    # State: After the loop, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the last element respectively
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: After checking, update the `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`
    
    return best_so_far

# Example usage
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (from subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (from subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2]))           # Expected output: -2 (single element case)
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]))  # Expected output: 6 (from subarray [-1, -2, -3])
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. **Updating `max_ending_here`**:
   ```python
   max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
   ```
   This ensures that we consider all possible subproblems including negative numbers, which can turn large products into smaller or vice versa.

2. **Updating `min_ending_here`**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
   ```
   This ensures we track both the maximum and minimum subarray products accurately, allowing us to correctly identify the global maximum product when a negative number flips the sign of the product.

With these adjustments, the function should work correctly for various edge cases, including sequences containing negative numbers, zeroes, and positive numbers.
