Let's review the provided Python function to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - The function handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `-inf`, which is correct.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`num`), it computes two temporary values: `temp` and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated by taking the maximum among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated by taking the minimum among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the `max_ending_here` value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.
   - The function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness:
The approach taken in this code is known as the Kadane's algorithm, adapted for handling products rather than sums. This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum ending products to handle negative numbers.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to be correct for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a list of integers. The logic seems sound, and the algorithm is correctly implemented.

To ensure correctness further, you can test the function with various test cases including edge cases (like empty lists, lists with all negatives, etc.).

Here’s a simple example to illustrate:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output should be 0
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output should be 12
```

These tests should validate the function’s correctness.
