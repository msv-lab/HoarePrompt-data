The provided solution appears to be almost correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, there's an unnecessary line that doesn't contribute to the logic, and the variable `temp` is not used correctly within the loop. Let's go through the corrected version step by step.

### Corrected Code

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # If the input list is empty, return -inf
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize the variables
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the potential new max and min products ending at this number
        temp_max = max(max_ending_here * num, num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(max_ending_here * num, num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update the current max and min products ending at this number
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # Update the best product found so far
        if temp_max > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = temp_max

    # Return the best product found
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Removed Unnecessary `temp` Variable:**
   - The `temp` variable was used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`, which isn't necessary for the logic. We can directly use `max_ending_here * num` for comparison and update the values.

2. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The `max` function should only include `max_ending_here * num`, `num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Similarly, the `min` function should only include `max_ending_here * num`, `num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updated Comments:**
   - Updated comments to better reflect the state of the program during each step.

### Correct Execution States with Comments

Hereâ€™s how the comments should look with the updated logic:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty

    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]  # Initialize the tracking variables

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max(max_ending_here * num, num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(max_ending_here * num, num, min_ending_here * num)

        max_ending_here = temp_max  # Update max product ending at this number
        min_ending_here = temp_min  # Update min product ending at this number

        if temp_max > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = temp_max  # Update best product found so far

    return best_so_far  # Return the best product found
```

This code now accurately finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given integer list.
