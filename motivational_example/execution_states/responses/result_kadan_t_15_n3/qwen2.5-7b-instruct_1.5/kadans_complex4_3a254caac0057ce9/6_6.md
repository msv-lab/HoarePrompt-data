Let's carefully review the code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the list is empty (`if (not xs)`), the function returns `-inf` which is correct since no sublist can be formed from an empty list.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

3. **Iterative Process:**
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`):
     - A temporary variable `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Final Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`.

### Key Insight
The key part of the algorithm here is the handling of negative numbers and zeros, which could affect the product. This approach ensures that we track both the maximum and minimum products up to the current point because multiplying by a negative number can flip the maximum and minimum values.

### Conclusion
The provided code is essentially implementing the Kadane's variant to solve the maximum product of a sublist problem. It correctly handles the edge cases and updates the state variables properly to account for both positive and negative numbers and zero.

Therefore, the solution is **correct** based on the problem description and the comments you provided.

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    # State: `xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the first element of xs.
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
    return best_so_far
```

This implementation should work correctly for the stated problem.
