Let's reason through the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Explanation:
We need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) in a given integer list.

### Given Program Analysis:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is computed as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated using the maximum of:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary value (`temp`)
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`)
     - `min_ending_here` is updated using the minimum of:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary value (`temp`)
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`)

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

### Reasoning:
- This approach handles two main scenarios:
  - When the current number can form a new subarray with better product.
  - When including the previous maximum/minimum ending values can improve the current product.
- By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position, the algorithm can handle cases where negative numbers contribute positively (or negatively) to the product depending on whether they are multiplied by other numbers that make the overall product larger.

### Correctness Verification:
Given this explanation, the algorithm correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist. It handles all cases, including sublists with multiple negatives contributing positively to the overall product when their count is even.

Thus, the provided program correctly solves the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
