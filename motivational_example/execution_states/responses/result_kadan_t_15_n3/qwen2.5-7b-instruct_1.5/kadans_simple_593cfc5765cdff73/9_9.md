### Explanation of Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The provided function `func_1` aims to solve this problem using dynamic programming principles.

Here's how it works:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is useful when there are negative numbers and we want to keep track of the lowest product so that multiplying by a future large positive number gives us a larger product.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` stores the best (maximum) product found so far among all possible sublists.

2. **Loop through the List**:
   - For each element in the list, we update `temp` which is essentially the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among three options: 
     - The current number itself (`num`),
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`), and
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among three options:
     - The current number itself (`num`),
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number,
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   
3. **Return the Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle scenarios where negative numbers can reverse the sign and thus increase the product. By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, the algorithm can efficiently find the solution.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in the code is consistent with solving this type of problem and seems to cover all edge cases including those with negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. However, it is good practice to test with some specific edge cases to ensure accuracy. Here are some key test cases to validate:

- A list with all negative numbers (e.g., \([-5, -3, -1, -6]\)).
- A list with a single element (e.g., `[4]`).
- A list with zeros (e.g., `[0, 1, -2, 3, 4, -2]`).

Based on the description and the logic presented, the provided program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
