### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided function `func_1` to understand its correctness in solving the given problem.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty and returns `float('-inf')`. This ensures that if the list is empty, it handles the edge case appropriately, as multiplying by 0 would result in 0 (which isn't considered when looking for the maximum product).

2. **Initialization:**
   - Three variables are initialized: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`. These are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum product subarray values ending at the current position and the best product found so far, respectively.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through each element in the list starting from the second element (since `xs[0]` is already used for initialization).
   - For each number, it calculates three potential values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is to update the value of `max_ending_here` considering the current number as a part of the existing maximum product.
     - `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates the `max_ending_here` by choosing the maximum of three possibilities:
       - The current number itself (considered when there is only one element left or the previous product is negative).
       - The `temp` which includes the current number with the previous maximum product.
       - The product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here`), which helps in recovering from negative products that can turn into larger positive products.
   - Similarly, for `min_ending_here`, it follows:
     - The current number itself.
     - The `temp` value, considering the transition from minimum to maximum due to multiplication by a negative number.
     - The product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.

4. **Updating Best Product:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it also updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` becomes greater than the current `best_so_far`.

5. **Return Statement:**
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness:

The function works correctly for several edge cases and general scenarios:

- It handles the scenario where all numbers are negative (e.g., `[-1, -2, -3]`), where the solution is the product of all elements.
- It accounts for transitions between minimum and maximum products effectively, which is essential in handling negative numbers that can lead to larger positive products when multiplied with other numbers.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
