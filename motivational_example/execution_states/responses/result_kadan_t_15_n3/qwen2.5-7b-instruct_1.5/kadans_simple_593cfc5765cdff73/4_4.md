### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The approach it uses is a dynamic programming strategy, similar to solving the problem of finding the maximum subarray sum but adapted to handle products.

Here's how the algorithm works:
1. It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`.
   - `min_ending_here`: The minimum product that ends at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: The maximum product that ends at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: The best (maximum) product found so far.

2. For each number in the input list:
   - It calculates the new `max_ending_here` considering whether to take the current number only, multiply it with the previous `max_ending_here`, or multiply it with the previous `min_ending_here`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the new `min_ending_here`.

3. After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, it updates `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that even when encountering a negative number, the minimum product up to that point can still produce a large positive product later.

The given program is correct for the problem statement provided.
