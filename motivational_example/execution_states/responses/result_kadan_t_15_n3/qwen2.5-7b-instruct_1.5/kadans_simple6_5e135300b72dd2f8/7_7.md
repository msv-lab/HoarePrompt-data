Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given integer list.

The code provided is implementing a variant of Kadane's algorithm, but adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers efficiently. The idea is to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a previously minimum product can become a maximum when multiplied by a negative number, and vice versa.

Here is a detailed analysis:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Save current max_ending_here before updating
        temp = max_ending_here
        
        # Calculate new values for max and min ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp * num, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list. This is a good start as the first element itself could be the maximum product.

2. **Loop Through List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one (`for num in xs[1:]`), the algorithm updates the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on whether the current number alone, the current number multiplied with `max_ending_here` (previous max), or the current number multiplied with `min_ending_here` (previous min) is greater.
   
3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After calculating the new values for `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new value is better than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Example:

For an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initially: 
  - `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- Iterating through the list:
  - At 3: 
    - `temp = 2`
    - `max_ending_here = max(3, 2*3, 2*3) = 6`, 
    - `min_ending_here = min(3, 2*3, 2*3) = 3`, 
    - `best_so_far` is updated to 6
  - At -2: 
    - `temp = 6`
    - `max_ending_here = max(-2, 6*(-2), 3*(-2)) = 6`, 
    - `min_ending_here = min(-2, 6*(-2), 3*(-2)) = -12`, 
    - `best_so_far` remains 6
  - At 4: 
    - `temp = 6`
    - `max_ending_here = max(4, 6*4, -12*4) = 24`, 
    - `min_ending_here = min(4, 6*4, -12*4) = -48`, 
    - `best_so_far` is updated to 24

Thus, the algorithm correctly finds that the maximum product of any sublist in this case is `24`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given integer list. Hence, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
