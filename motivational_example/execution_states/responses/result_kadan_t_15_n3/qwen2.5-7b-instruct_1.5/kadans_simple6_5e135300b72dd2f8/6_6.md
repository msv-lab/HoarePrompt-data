Let's analyze the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

The given code implements a dynamic programming approach where two variables (`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`) track the minimum and maximum products ending at each position. This approach allows the algorithm to consider both negative and positive numbers efficiently.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each number `num`, we calculate the following:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   
3. **Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return `best_so_far`**.

### Test Cases to Validate Correctness:
To ensure the correctness of the function, let's run it on some test cases.

```python
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0, "Test case 2 failed"
    assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]) == 6, "Test case 3 failed"
    assert func_1([-1]) == -1, "Test case 4 failed"
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf'), "Test case 5 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

test_func_1()
```

### Analysis:
The given solution should handle most edge cases, including negative numbers and zero. However, it has one minor issue when dealing with all zeros in the list, which would incorrectly return the last element rather than `float('-inf')`.

### Revised Solution:
If you want to fix the edge case of handling a list of all zeros, the code can be slightly adjusted to ensure it returns `float('-inf')` when the input list is empty and to handle the case where there are only zeros correctly.

Here's the revised version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    zeros_count = xs.count(0)
    
    # Handle list with all zeros separately
    if zeros_count == len(xs):
        return float('-inf')
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here == 0:
            max_ending_here = xs[1]
        if min_ending_here == 0:
            min_ending_here = xs[1]

    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

Given this analysis, the original solution without handling all zeros correctly does have a flaw, but the logic for solving the core problem is correct. Therefore, the overall answer to the correctness question is:

Correctness: **False**
