The provided solution seems correct for the given problem. The algorithm used is an efficient way to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. It keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Let's break down the correctness of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are correctly set to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list (starting from the second element), it updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on whether the current element (`num`) is positive, negative, or zero. This ensures that the maximum product found so far (`best_so_far`) is updated whenever a larger product is found.

3. **Handling empty list**: If the input list is empty, it correctly returns `float('-inf')`.

Given the comments about the expected execution state, we can conclude that the provided Python function is indeed correct for solving the given problem.

**Correctness:** True
