Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` step by step to ensure it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

The function `func_1` is implementing a dynamic programming approach that uses three variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position in the array. This is crucial because multiplying a negative number with a current maximum product can become a new minimum product, and vice versa. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `max_ending_here` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the following operations are performed:
     - Calculate `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Check for Best Result**:
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the Best Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return `best_so_far`.

Let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
```

After testing, the function works as expected and handles various cases including positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and multiple sublists.

Based on this analysis, the function seems correct.

### Final Answer
**Correctness**: True
