To determine if the given solution is correct, let's analyze the logic of the function and see if it accurately solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

The key idea here is that the maximum product of sublists can switch between positive and negative values depending on whether we multiply by another positive or negative number. To handle this, the algorithm uses `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product ending at the current position and `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This way, when a negative number is encountered, the minimum product becomes the new maximum, and vice versa.

Let's test this with a few examples:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (Sublist [2, 3] has product 6)
print(func_1([-1, -3, -10, 0, 60]))  # Expected output: 60 (Sublist [60] has product 60)
print(func_1([-2, -3, 0, -2, -40]))  # Expected output: 800 (Sublist [-2, -40] has product 800)
```

Given the logic described and the test cases, the provided solution appears to be correct. The solution handles both positive and negative numbers effectively, considering the possibility of zero and how it can reset the state of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the correctness of the provided solution is **True**.
