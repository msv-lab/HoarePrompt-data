The provided program appears to be a variation of Kadane's algorithm, but it aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist rather than the maximum sum. The implementation is generally correct for solving the problem described. Let's review the code step by step:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the input list is empty.
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]  # Initialize min_ending_here to the first element.
    max_ending_here = xs[0]  # Initialize max_ending_here to the first element.
    best_so_far = xs[0]      # Initialize best_so_far to the first element.
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num  # Calculate temp as the product of current max_ending_here and the next number.
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)  # Update max_ending_here.
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)  # Update min_ending_here.
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here  # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater.
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products that can be achieved up to the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.
- For each number in the list, we calculate three values: 
  - The product of `num` and `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
  - The product of `num` and `min_ending_here`.
  - Just the current number `num`.

The idea is to consider both positive and negative numbers, as a previously minimum product combined with a negative number can turn into a large product.

### Test Cases:
Let's test the function with some sample inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))     # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))     # Expected output: 42
print(func_1([]))              # Expected output: -inf
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Expected output: 24
```

### Correctness:
Given the nature of the problem and the logic implemented, the provided function seems to handle edge cases correctly and finds the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, the solution is **Correct**.
