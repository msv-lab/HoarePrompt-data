The solution provided appears to be correct based on the problem description. The program aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the input list.
2. As the function iterates through each number in the list starting from the second element:
   - It calculates three possible products: 
     - The product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`).
     - The current number itself.
     - The product of the current number and the current `min_ending_here`.
3. These three values determine what the new `max_ending_here` will be, considering that the minimum product (which could then become a large positive when multiplied by a negative number) also needs to be tracked.
4. The function updates `best_so_far` with the highest value of `max_ending_here` found during iteration.
5. Finally, it returns the best result found (`best_so_far`).

To ensure correctness, this logic correctly handles scenarios involving negative numbers, zero, and multiple zeros, which are key considerations for this type of problem.

Here is the solution again with added comments for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # Handle empty list case
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate potential new maximum ending here by considering current, temp, and min ending here
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Calculate potential new minimum ending here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # Update the global best so far if needed
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Given this explanation, your assessment of the solution's correctness should be:

**True**
