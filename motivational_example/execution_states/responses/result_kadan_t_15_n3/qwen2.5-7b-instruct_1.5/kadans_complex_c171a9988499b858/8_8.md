The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the comments provided. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly:

1. **Initial Checks and Conditions**: The program starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf`, which is correct because the maximum product cannot be determined without any elements in the list.

2. **Dynamic Programming Variables Initialization**: The program initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` to store the highest product found so far.

3. **Iterative Process**: It then iterates through the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`. This is used for comparison with other potential values.
   - `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to reflect the maximum and minimum possible products of subarrays ending at the current position. This update considers three scenarios:
     1. The current number itself.
     2. The product of `temp` and the current number (i.e., considering the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could change the sign).
     3. The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (since the minimum product might become the maximum when multiplied by a negative number).

4. **Updating Best So Far**: During each iteration, if `max_ending_here` becomes larger than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product found throughout the list.

This approach correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zeros, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is identified. Given the detailed state descriptions and logic flow, the program accurately implements the required functionality.

**Correctness:** True
