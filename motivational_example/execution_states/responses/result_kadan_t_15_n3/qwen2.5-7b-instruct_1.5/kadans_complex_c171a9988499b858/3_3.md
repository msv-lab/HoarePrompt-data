To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's review the logic and see if it correctly implements the solution to finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers.

The algorithm described in the comments and the code logic seems to be following the "kadane's variation" technique used to solve this problem, which is well-known for finding the maximum subarray sum but here it's adapted for the maximum product.

Here is the key logic in the code:
1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element, updating the `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` with the current element and the calculated product considering the current `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
3. Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` becomes greater than `best_so_far`.

The code does the following in detail:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        # Update the max and min ending at current position.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Track the best maximum seen so far.
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: *`xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. 
    # If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element (`xs[0]`).
- **Iterating through the list:** For each number `num` in the list, we calculate `temp` as the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number.
- **Updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`:** This step considers the transition from the previous elements and decides whether to start a new subarray (using just `num`), continue with the current maximum (`max_ending_here * num`), or the minimum product up to now (`min_ending_here * num`).
- **Updating `best_so_far`:** If `max_ending_here` is found to be greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` with `max_ending_here`.

This logic handles cases where there are negative numbers (which can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by a negative number).

### Verification:
The program correctly updates `best_so_far` to keep track of the highest maximum product found during iteration.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logic and its implementation in the program, it appears that the given Python program is correct in solving the stated problem. Therefore, the answer to your query is:

Correctness: **True**
