Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to be the first element of the list. This sets up the initial values that will track the minimum and maximum products of subarrays ending at each position.

2. **Iterate Through List**: The for loop iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each number, it updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
   - `temp` stores the product of the current number and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, `temp` (which represents extending the current maximum product subarray), and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here` (considering negative numbers could turn a small positive product into a large negative one).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list is empty, the program correctly returns `-inf`, which signifies no valid product.

This algorithm efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product subarray. Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided states.
