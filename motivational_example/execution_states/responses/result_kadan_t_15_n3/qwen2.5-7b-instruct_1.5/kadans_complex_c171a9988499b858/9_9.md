Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers. Let's break down the key points that validate this correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, returning `-inf` (negative infinity).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This initialization is crucial because it ensures the initial state considers the possibility of the maximum product starting from the first element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, tracking the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the program computes three possible scenarios for the maximum and minimum product ending at that element:
     - Multiplying the current number with the `max_ending_here`.
     - Using the current number directly.
     - Multiplying the current number with the `min_ending_here` (considering the effect of negative numbers flipping sign).
   - The `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated based on these calculations.
   - The `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found.

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After iterating through all elements, the function returns the `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly, including edge cases where the list might contain all negative numbers, leading to finding the maximum product as a large negative number when considering its absolute value.

Thus, the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement and should return the correct result for any valid input.
