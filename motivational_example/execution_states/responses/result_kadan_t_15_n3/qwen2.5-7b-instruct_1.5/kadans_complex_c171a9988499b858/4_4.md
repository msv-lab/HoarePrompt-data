Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the comments provided. Here's why:

1. The program initializes variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` correctly with the first element of the list.

2. It iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates three potential products:
   - `num` (current number itself).
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num` (product of the current maximum product ending at the previous element and the current number).
   - `min_ending_here * num` (product of the current minimum product ending at the previous element and the current number).

3. These three potential products are then used to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
   - `max_ending_here` is set to the maximum of these three values.
   - `min_ending_here` is set to the minimum of these three values.

4. This ensures that the program considers the effects of negative numbers on the product, which is crucial for finding the maximum product.

5. After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, it updates `best_so_far` with the value of `max_ending_here`. This ensures that the best maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

6. If the list is empty, it correctly returns `-inf`.

The comments and the logic within the program align well, making the program correct for the given problem.
