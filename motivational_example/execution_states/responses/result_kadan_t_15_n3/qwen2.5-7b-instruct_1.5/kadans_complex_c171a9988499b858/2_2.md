The given program is **Correct**.

Here's why:

### Analysis of the Given Code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # The following check and assignment are redundant since max_ending_here will hold the best_so_far already
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list, which helps track the smallest and largest products of subarrays that end at the current position.

2. **Iterate through the List:**
   - For each subsequent element, we compute:
     - `temp`: The product of the current maximum ending here (`max_ending_here`) with the next number.
     - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The next number itself,
       - `temp`, which represents extending the current subarray with the next number,
       - The product of the current minimum ending here (`min_ending_here`) and the next number.
     - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
       - The next number itself,
       - `temp`,
       - The product of the current minimum ending here (`min_ending_here`) and the next number.

3. **Update the Best Result:**
   - After iterating through all numbers, `max_ending_here` should hold the largest product of any subarray. Hence, it is correctly returned.

4. **Redundant Check:**
   - The check `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):` and assignment `best_so_far = max_ending_here` is unnecessary because `max_ending_here` was always being updated to the best product encountered during iteration.

In conclusion, the logic is sound and correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the maximum product subarray problem. The provided comments accurately describe the state transitions and logic flow.

Thus, **the given program is correct**.
