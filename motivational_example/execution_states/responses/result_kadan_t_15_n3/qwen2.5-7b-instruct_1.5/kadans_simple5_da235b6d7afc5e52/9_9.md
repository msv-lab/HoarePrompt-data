Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python function `func_1`.

### Problem Description
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a list of integers.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: The function iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element.
- **Update Logic**:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This variable stores the product if we continue the current maximum subarray product.
  - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: We update the maximum product ending at the current position by considering three possibilities:
    1. Starting a new subarray at the current position (just the current number).
    2. Continuing the previous maximum subarray product and including the current number.
    3. Continuing the previous minimum subarray product and including the current number.
  - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: We update the minimum product ending at the current position similarly to ensure that if the list contains negative numbers, we can still track the potential maximum products.

### Correctness
This approach is based on Kadane's algorithm but adapted for handling both positive and negative numbers efficiently. It works correctly by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, which allows it to correctly account for the effect of negative numbers.

### Example Test Cases
To verify the correctness of the function, let's test it with some example cases:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list should return `-inf`.
2. **Positive Numbers Only**: A list like `[2, 3, -2, 4]` should give the product of the whole list since all numbers are positive.
3. **Mixed Numbers Including Negative**: A list like `[2, 3, -2, -4]` should return the product of the entire array as `-2 * -4 = 8`.

Let's run a few test cases:

```python
# Test case 1: Empty list
print(func_1([]))  # Expected output: -inf

# Test case 2: Positive numbers only
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 24

# Test case 3: Mixed numbers including negative
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, -4]))  # Expected output: 8
```

### Conclusion
The provided solution does indeed solve the problem correctly. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the given list of integers.
