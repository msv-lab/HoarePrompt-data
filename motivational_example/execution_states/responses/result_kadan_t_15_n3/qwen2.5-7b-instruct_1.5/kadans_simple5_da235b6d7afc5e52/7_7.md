Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python function to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Provided Solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Handle empty list case
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # temp is used to store the product if we were to start a new subarray at this point
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:
The solution appears to be correct and follows a dynamic programming approach. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product seen so far.

2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - For each element in the list, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider the following cases:
     - Starting a new subarray at the current element.
     - Continuing a subarray with the current element as the last element.
     - Extending a subarray with the current element as the middle or second-to-last element (this is managed through `min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Update the Best So Far:**
   - After processing each element, the code checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than the previously recorded `best_so_far`. If it is, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Empty List Handling:**
   - The function correctly handles the case of an empty list by returning `float('-inf')`, which indicates that no product can be formed.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the solution provided in the `func_1` function correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist. It accounts for all necessary cases to ensure that the global maximum product is found.
