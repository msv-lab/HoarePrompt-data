The provided Python function `func_1` indeed solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
2. **Iterating through the list**: It iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates the following:
   - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
3. **Updating the best result**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.
4. **Returning the result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

This approach effectively handles both positive and negative numbers in the list. When the product of two negative numbers results in a positive product, it can lead to a new maximum product if the subsequent number is positive.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown to ensure correctness:
- If the list contains all positive numbers or all zero (except for the first element which is set as the initial value), the algorithm will simply return the maximum element.
- If the list contains a mix of positive and negative numbers, the algorithm correctly identifies the maximum product by considering the product of the minimum ending here (to capture potential future larger products) and the current number.

To illustrate the solution with some test cases:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6 (product of [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output should be 0 (single element is 0)
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output should be 24 (product of the entire list)
print(func_1([0, -1, -2, -3]))  # Output should be 6 (product of [-1, -2])
```

These test cases should all produce the expected outputs, confirming that the solution is correct.
