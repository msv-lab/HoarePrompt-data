The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The function uses dynamic programming concepts to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, which allows it to handle negative numbers effectively.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the list `xs` is empty, it returns `float('-inf')`, indicating that there's no valid product (this handles edge cases).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also set to the first element, initially storing the best (largest) product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the temporary product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, the `temp`, or the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here` is similarly updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number itself, `temp`, or the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing each number, `best_so_far` is updated if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found in the input list.

This approach ensures that the algorithm efficiently computes the result in linear time (O(n)) and handles both positive and negative numbers properly. Therefore, the provided function should correctly solve the given problem.
