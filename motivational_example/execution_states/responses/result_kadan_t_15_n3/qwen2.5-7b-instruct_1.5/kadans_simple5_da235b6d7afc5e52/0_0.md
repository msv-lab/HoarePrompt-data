Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` does solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from an integer list. 

Let's break down how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `float('-inf')`, which handles the edge case where no sublists can be formed.
   - It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. These variables are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at each position as well as the best product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one (i.e., `num` in `xs[1:]`), the function updates these values:
     - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current number `num`, `temp` (which is `max_ending_here * num`), and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values, ensuring that we consider the possibility of the product becoming smaller due to negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, the function ensures that the value of `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` has a larger value than the current `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

The logic used here is inspired by the Kadane's algorithm but modified to handle the possibility of products being minimized due to negative numbers, making it suitable for this specific problem.

So yes, the solution correctly solves the problem given the problem statement.
