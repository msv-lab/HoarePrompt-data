The provided solution does correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the solution works:

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which will store the best (maximum) product found so far.

- **Iteration**:
  - The loop iterates through each number in the list starting from the second element.
  - For each number, it calculates the temporary value `temp`, which represents the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

- **Update Best Product**:
  - After each iteration, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum value between itself and `max_ending_here`.

### Example Execution:
Consider the list `[-2, 3, -4, 5, -6]`:

1. **Initial values**:
   - `min_ending_here = -2`
   - `max_ending_here = -2`
   - `best_so_far = -2`

2. **First iteration** (`num = 3`):
   - `temp = -2 * 3 = -6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, -6, -2 * 3) = 3`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, -6, -2 * 3) = -6`
   - `best_so_far` remains `-2` since `3` is not greater than `-2`.

3. **Second iteration** (`num = -4`):
   - `temp = 3 * -4 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-4, -12, -6 * -4) = -4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-4, -12, -6 * -4) = -12`
   - `best_so_far` remains `-2` since `-4` and `-12` are both less than `-2`.

4. **Third iteration** (`num = 5`):
   - `temp = -4 * 5 = -20`
   - `max_ending_here = max(5, -20, -12 * 5) = 5`
   - `min_ending_here = min(5, -20, -12 * 5) = -20`
   - `best_so_far` updates to `5` since `5` is greater than `-2`.

5. **Fourth iteration** (`num = -6`):
   - `temp = -20 * -6 = 120`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-6, 120, -20 * -6) = 120`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-6, 120, -20 * -6) = -6`
   - `best_so_far` updates to `120` since `120` is greater than `5`.

The function returns `120` as the maximum product of any sublist, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given solution works correctly and efficiently to find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
