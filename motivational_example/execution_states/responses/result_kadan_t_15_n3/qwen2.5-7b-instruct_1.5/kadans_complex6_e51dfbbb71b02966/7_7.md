Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The logic of maintaining both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is sound and ensures that even when encountering negative numbers, the algorithm can still track the maximum product. The `temp` variable acts as a helper to ensure that each state update considers all possible sublists ending at the current position.

Let's break down why it works:
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current index to handle negative numbers that could turn a previously large minimum product into a large positive product.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall best product found so far.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for sublists containing negative numbers and zeroes, which is crucial for determining the maximum product.

Therefore, the implementation provided in the solution is correct.
