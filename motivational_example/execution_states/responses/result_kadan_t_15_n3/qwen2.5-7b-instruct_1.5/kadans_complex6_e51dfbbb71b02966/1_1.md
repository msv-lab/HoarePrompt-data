The given program is indeed correct. Let's verify it step-by-step based on the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Description:
- Given a list of integers (`xs`), find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Analysis of the Solution:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which makes sense as there is no product to be calculated.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`. This helps in handling the edge case where all numbers are negative.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
        
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one, the following logic updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: Compute the potential new `max_ending_here` if we multiply the current number with the previous maximum product.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Update the maximum product ending here by considering three cases:
       - The current number itself (`num`).
       - The potential new maximum product computed by multiplying the previous maximum (`max_ending_here`) with the current number.
       - The potential new maximum product computed by multiplying the previous minimum (`min_ending_here`) with the current number.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` considering the three cases but with `min` instead of `max`.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After iterating through all the elements, if the current maximum product `max_ending_here` is greater than the previously recorded best product `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to this new maximum.

5. **Return Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented correctly handles the edge cases and computes the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. The solution is mathematically sound and works as intended.

### Answer:
Correctness: **True**
