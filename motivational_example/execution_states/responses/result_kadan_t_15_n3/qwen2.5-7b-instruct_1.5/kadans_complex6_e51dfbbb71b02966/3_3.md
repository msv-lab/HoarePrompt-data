The provided solution seems to correctly address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's review the logic step-by-step:

1. The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
2. For each subsequent element in the list, it updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` based on three possibilities:
   - The current element alone.
   - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
   - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
3. After processing all elements, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
4. Finally, it returns `best_so_far`.

This approach accounts for the scenario where the product can be maximized by multiplying negative numbers, which can turn into positive products.

Given the logic and the comments, the solution appears to be correct. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
