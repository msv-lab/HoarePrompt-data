The given program is **Correct**. 

Let's break down the solution to understand why it works:

1. The function starts by checking if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf`, which means that there is no valid product to compute because the list has no elements.

2. It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` all set to the first element of the list. These variables will help track the minimum and maximum products that can be obtained ending at the current position as the algorithm iterates through the list.

3. For each subsequent element in the list, the following steps are taken:
   - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - The new `max_ending_here` is calculated by considering three possibilities:
     - The current number alone.
     - The product of `temp` and the current number.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Similarly, the new `min_ending_here` is calculated by considering the same three possibilities but looking for the minimum value instead of the maximum.

4. After updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iterations.

This approach correctly handles cases where negative numbers can lead to higher (i.e., more positive) products when multiplied together compared to large positive numbers. Thus, the given solution effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
