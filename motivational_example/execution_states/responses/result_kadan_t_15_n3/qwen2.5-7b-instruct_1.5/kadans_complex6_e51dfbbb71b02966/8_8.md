Correctness: True

The given Python function `func_1` is correct for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. The logic used in the function is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, but adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This ensures that if there's a negative number involved, the current minimum product can potentially become the new maximum product when multiplied by another negative number.

Here's a brief overview of why it works:

1. The initial checks and variable assignments correctly handle the case where the input list is empty.
2. The loop iterates through each element, updating `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` appropriately.
3. The use of `temp` allows the calculation of potential products while updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
4. The final comparison updates `best_so_far` only if `max_ending_here` has a higher value, ensuring the overall maximum product is returned.

This approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness for the given problem.
