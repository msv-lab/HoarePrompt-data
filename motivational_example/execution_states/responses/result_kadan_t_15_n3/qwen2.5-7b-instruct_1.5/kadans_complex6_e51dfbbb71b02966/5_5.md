The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Let's verify it step-by-step:

1. **Edge Case Handling:** The function correctly handles an empty input list by returning `float('-inf')`.
2. **Initialization:** It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
3. **Iterative Calculation:** It iterates through the list starting from the second element, updating the `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and tracking the best product so far.
4. **Updating Best Product:** After the loop, it ensures that the best product (`best_so_far`) is updated if the current `max_ending_here` is greater.

The algorithm correctly manages the product calculations even when there are negative numbers in the list, which can flip the sign and affect the maximum product.

Let's review the code again for correctness:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Given the logic described and the implementation, the solution should work correctly for all cases.

Thus, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
