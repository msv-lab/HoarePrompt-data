Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given integer list. The approach it takes uses a dynamic programming-like method where we keep track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - If the list `xs` is empty, return `-infinity` as specified.
   - Initialize three variables:
     - `min_ending_here` to track the minimum product ending at the current index (since a negative number could reverse a previous maximum to minimum).
     - `max_ending_here` to track the maximum product ending at the current index.
     - `best_so_far` to store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), calculate three possibilities:
     - `temp` represents the product of the current element with `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` updates to the maximum value between the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`. This captures the possibility that multiplying the negative `min_ending_here` with a positive number could give a larger product.
     - `min_ending_here` updates to the minimum value between the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`. This helps handle cases where the minimum product ending here might be needed later.
   
3. **Update**:
   - After calculating the maximum and minimum products ending at the current index, update `best_so_far` if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the highest product found (`best_so_far`).

The logic is sound and correctly handles both positive and negative numbers as well as zeros, which can reset the product to 1 (by default due to multiplication properties) but still need to be accounted for to update the minimum value appropriately. 

Therefore, the function is correct for solving the given problem.
