Correctness: True

### Explanation:
The provided program aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list `xs`. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both initialize to the first element of the list, which is the starting point for tracking the current minimum and maximum product that includes the last processed number.
   - `best_so_far` also initializes to the first element, which will keep track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), we need to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering three possibilities:
     1. The current number alone (`num`).
     2. The current number multiplied by the previous `max_ending_here`.
     3. The current number multiplied by the previous `min_ending_here`.

   - The reason for this logic:
     - If `max_ending_here` is negative, multiplying it by a negative number (or a very small positive number) could turn it into a large positive number, hence updating it.
     - Similarly, `min_ending_here` can be updated in a similar manner because it can turn negative values into larger negatives when multiplied by smaller negative numbers.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - During each iteration, the `max_ending_here` is compared with `best_so_far`, and `best_so_far` is updated if a new maximum product is found.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `float('-inf')`, which handles the edge case correctly by assuming that the product of any empty subarray is undefined but represented as negative infinity.

The given program effectively captures all these aspects, making it a correct solution for finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in the given integer list.
