Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided program `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The solution is indeed correct and follows a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of two values at each step:

1. **`max_ending_here`**: The maximum product of the sublist ending at the current element.
2. **`min_ending_here`**: The minimum product of the sublist ending at the current element.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the code works correctly:

- **Initialization**: 
  - We initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list `xs`.

- **Iterate through the list**:
  - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
    - We temporarily store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp = max_ending_here * num`).
    - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among:
      - The current number itself (`num`),
      - The temporary product (`temp`),
      - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
    - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum value among:
      - The current number itself (`num`),
      - The temporary product (`temp`),
      - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

- **Update `best_so_far`**:
  - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

- **Edge case**:
  - The function returns `float('-inf')` if the input list `xs` is empty, ensuring that any non-negative value returned from the list will be larger.

### Example:
For the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initial state: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
- Iterating through the list:
  - At 3: `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`, `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, -4) = 6`, `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, -4) = -4`, `best_so_far = 6`.
  - At -2: `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`, `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, -8) = -2`, `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, -8) = -12`, `best_so_far = 6`.
  - At 4: `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`, `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -48) = 4`, `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -48) = -48`, `best_so_far = 6`.

So, the function correctly returns the maximum product, which is `6` for this example.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
