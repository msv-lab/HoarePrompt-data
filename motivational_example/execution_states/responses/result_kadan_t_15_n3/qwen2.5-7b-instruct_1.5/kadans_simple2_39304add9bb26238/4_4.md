Correctness: True

The given Python program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a step-by-step verification:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This handles cases where the list might have negative numbers that could turn a large negative product into a large positive one.
   
2. **Loop Through List**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), it calculates the possible new products based on the current `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: this considers if extending the current maximum product ending here (if `max_ending_here` is positive) makes sense.
     - `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: this selects the best value among starting fresh, extending the current maximum product, and extending the minimum product (to consider cases where a negative number can make a big difference).
     - `min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: similar logic but for the minimum product to handle scenarios where a negative number can turn a large positive product into a larger negative one.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing each number, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product found.

This algorithm efficiently keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position to handle sequences of negative numbers and zeros correctly. Thus, the given code is correct for solving the problem.
