Let's think through this step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input and returns the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist).

2. It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to be the first element of the list. This setup allows tracking the minimum and maximum products up to the current element, considering both positive and negative numbers which could flip the sign of the product.

3. It then iterates over the list starting from the second element:
   - For each element, it calculates three potential new values for `max_ending_here`:
     - The element itself (`num`)
     - The product of the current `max_ending_here` and the element (`max_ending_here * num`)
     - The product of the current `min_ending_here` and the element (`min_ending_here * num`)
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of these three values.
   - Similarly, it calculates and updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the three values. This is important because even though `min_ending_here` tracks the minimum so far, it needs to consider how a negative number can potentially turn into a maximum product if multiplied by a subsequent negative number.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. The loop continues until all elements are processed, and the final `best_so_far` value is returned, representing the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product efficiently with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.

Therefore, the provided program appears to be correct in solving the problem.
