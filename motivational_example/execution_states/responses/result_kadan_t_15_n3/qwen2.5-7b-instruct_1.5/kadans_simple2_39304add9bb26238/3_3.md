Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Understanding the Problem
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a list of integers. The problem involves considering both positive and negative numbers since a negative number multiplied by another negative number results in a positive number which could be part of the maximum product.

### Given Code
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element.
   
2. **Loop through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each element `num` in the list, three potential products are computed:
     - `num` itself (considering the start of a new subarray).
     - `max_ending_here * num` (continuing an existing subarray where `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product up to the previous element).
     - `min_ending_here * num` (since multiplying a negative number can turn into a larger positive number).

3. **Update Variables**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the three computed values.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the three computed values.

4. **Track the Best Solution**:
   - If `max_ending_here` at the current iteration is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return `best_so_far`.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty List**: The function correctly handles this edge case by returning `float('-inf')`.
- **List with All Negative Numbers**: The algorithm works well for such cases. For example, for the list `[-2, -3, -4]`, the output should be `-2 * -3 * -4 = -24`. The algorithm will correctly identify that the maximum product is `min_ending_here` when it encounters the third element.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and potential scenarios, we see that the given implementation correctly solves the problem by considering the impact of negative numbers and maintaining the necessary states (`min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`). It handles both positive and negative products accurately.

### Final Answer
**Correctness: True**
