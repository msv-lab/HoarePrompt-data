Let's think through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Understanding the Program

The given function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (or sublist) from a given list of integers `xs`.

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary because even though we're looking for the maximum product, we need to handle cases where the product can become negative (turning large negatives into large positives).
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far across all positions in the array.

### Key Logic

- At each step, the algorithm calculates three possibilities:
  1. The current number itself (`num`).
  2. The product of the maximum product ending at the previous position (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`temp = max_ending_here * num`).
  3. The product of the minimum product ending at the previous position (`min_ending_here`) and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

- The reason behind calculating these three possibilities is:
  - If the current number itself is positive, then we should use it.
  - If the previous product (`max_ending_here`) multiplied by the current number results in a larger product than `min_ending_here * num`, then we choose the larger one as the new `max_ending_here`.
  - The logic for `min_ending_here` is symmetric: we need to consider the minimum because multiplying a large negative number with a positive number can still give a smaller (more negative) result, which could lead to a larger maximum product when combined with another factor later.

### Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Empty List**: 
   - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is correct since no product can be computed and the smallest possible value is returned.
   
2. **List with Positive Numbers Only**:
   - For example, `xs = [2, 3, 4]`, the function correctly identifies the maximum product as `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

3. **List with Negative Numbers Only**:
   - For example, `xs = [-2, -3, -4]`, the function correctly identifies the maximum product as `-2 * -3 * -4 = -24`.

4. **List with a Mixture of Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - For example, `xs = [2, -5, 6, -4, 3]`, the function correctly identifies the maximum product as `2 * -5 * -4 * 3 = 120`.

### Conclusion

Based on the logic provided and the explanation above, the given program correctly computes the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

**Correctness:** True
