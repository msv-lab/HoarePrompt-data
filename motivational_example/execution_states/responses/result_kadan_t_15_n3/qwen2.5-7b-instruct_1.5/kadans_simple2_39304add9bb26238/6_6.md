Correctness: True

The provided Python program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products that end with the current element, considering that the next element could be positive or negative.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - The `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum value among the current number, the temporary value `temp`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
     - The `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum value among the current number, the temporary value `temp`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, if it is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

4. **Return statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which will be the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach works even when there are negative numbers in the list because the product of two negative numbers can become positive, potentially leading to a larger maximum product. Therefore, the logic correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, including zero. 

So, the given code is correct and handles all necessary edge cases.
