Let's analyze the provided solution to see if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Solution Analysis

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This tracks the minimum and maximum products that can end at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element, which will keep track of the maximum product seen so far.

2. **Loop through the list:**
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (i.e., `xs[1:]`), calculate `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - After processing all elements, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return `best_so_far`:**
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which will be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Test Cases:
To validate the correctness of this solution, let's test it with some examples:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (because 3 * -2 * 4 = 24, but considering the sign alternation, the answer is 3 * 4 = 12 or 4 * 3 = 12 or 2 * 3 = 6)
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (because the best product is just 0, since including any negative number would reduce the product to zero or a smaller value)
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 24 (because -2 * -3 * -4 = -24, but considering the absolute values, the answer is 24)
```

Running these test cases, the function should provide the correct answers.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum product of any sublist, handling both positive and negative numbers effectively. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness:** True
