The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why:

- The function maintains three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`. These help track the minimum and maximum products that can end at the current position.
- `min_ending_here` helps account for the possibility of turning a large negative number into a large positive number when multiplied by another negative number.
- The loop iterates through each element of the list, updating these values appropriately.
- The final answer is returned as `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product found during the iteration.

Let's test it with some cases to ensure its correctness:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))      # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))        # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))        # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]))    # Expected output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2])
print(func_1([0, 2, 3, -1, 4, -2, 1]))  # Expected output: 24 (sublist [2, 3, -1, 4])
```

Based on the description and the logical flow of the code, it seems the solution correctly implements the logic needed to find the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
