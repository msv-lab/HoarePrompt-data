The provided solution is generally correct and will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. However, there's a small optimization that can be made to ensure clarity and robustness.

Hereâ€™s the original code with a minor comment adjustment for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Compute the temporary values before updating min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_min, temp_max)
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_min, temp_max)
        
        # Update the best so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

The solution works as follows:
1. If the input list `xs` is empty, it returns `float('-inf')`.
2. It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
3. It iterates through the list starting from the second element.
4. For each element, it calculates two temporary values (`temp_min` and `temp_max`) which are used to decide the new values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
5. It updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` based on these temporary values.
6. It also updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

This logic ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly because the minimum and maximum products at each step are considered.

So, the correctness of the solution is:
Correctness: **True**
