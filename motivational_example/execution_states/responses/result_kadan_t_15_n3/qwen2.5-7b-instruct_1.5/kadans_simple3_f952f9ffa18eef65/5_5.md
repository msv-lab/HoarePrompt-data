The provided solution appears to be correct. Let's break it down to understand why:

### Explanation:

The algorithm used here is a common approach for solving problems related to finding the maximum product of a contiguous subarray. The idea is to maintain two values:

- `max_ending_here`: This stores the maximum product that can be obtained up to the current element.
- `min_ending_here`: This stores the minimum product that can be obtained up to the current element.

The reason we keep track of both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is because when a negative number is encountered, what was once a minimum product can now become the maximum product due to the multiplication of the new negative number with this minimum product.

Here's how the logic works:

1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. For each element, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
   - `temp` is the current element multiplied by the previous `max_ending_here`. This helps decide the new value of `max_ending_here` based on whether to continue extending the existing sequence or start anew.
4. After processing all elements, the value of `max_ending_here` (which should hold the best product found so far) is returned.

### Edge Case Considerations:
- If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `float('-inf')`.
- Handling negative numbers properly is crucial, as they can invert the maximum and minimum products.

Given these considerations, the function appears to correctly solve the problem. 

### Correctness:
**True**
