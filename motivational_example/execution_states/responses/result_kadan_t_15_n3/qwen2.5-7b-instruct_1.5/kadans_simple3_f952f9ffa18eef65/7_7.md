The provided solution appears to be correct. Let's break down why it works:

1. The algorithm initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here`: Keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position (this is needed to handle negative numbers).
   - `max_ending_here`: Keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the maximum product found so far.

2. It iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), updating these values as follows:
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current number and `max_ending_here`. This represents continuing a sequence with a positive product.
   - `max_ending_here` is then updated to be the maximum of:
     - The current number (`num`) itself.
     - `temp`, which is the previous maximum product sequence extended by the current number.
     - The minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here` multiplied by `num`), to handle the case where the previous minimum product turns into the new maximum when multiplied by a negative number.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
     - The current number (`num`).
     - `temp`.
     - The minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here` multiplied by `num`).

3. After processing all elements, it ensures that the final answer is stored in `best_so_far`.

This approach efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and can detect large positive products in lists that contain multiple negatives. Here is the solution again for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

So, based on the description and the analysis, the provided Python code is indeed correct.
