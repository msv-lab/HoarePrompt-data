The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist correctly. The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position, which allows it to handle cases where negative numbers can turn large products into small ones or vice versa.

Here's a brief explanation of why the function works:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current number.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current number.
- For each element in the list, the function considers three possibilities: starting a new sublist with the current element, extending the previous maximum product sublist with the current element, and extending the previous minimum product sublist with the current element.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
