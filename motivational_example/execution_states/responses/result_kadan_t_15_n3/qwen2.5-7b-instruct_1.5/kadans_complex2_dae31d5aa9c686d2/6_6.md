Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the input list `xs`. Let's break down the logic and ensure its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `xs` is empty (`not xs`), the function returns `-inf`. This handles the case where no elements are present, ensuring a valid negative infinity value is returned.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of `xs`. These variables keep track of:
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
     - `best_so_far`: The maximum product found across all sublists seen so far.

3. **Iterate Through List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values:
       - `num` (considering starting a new sublist).
       - `temp` (continuing the existing sublist with the current element).
       - `min_ending_here * num` (extending a previous minimum product to a possible higher value, useful when there are negative numbers).
     - Update `min_ending_here` similarly to track the minimum product, ensuring that even in scenarios with negative numbers, the logic correctly captures the highest product.

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After the loop, check if the newly calculated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
   - Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is larger, but since we're tracking the best throughout the loop already, this final check is somewhat redundant.
   - Return `best_so_far`.

### Verification:
- The approach leverages the idea of maintaining both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to handle cases with negative numbers.
- The use of these two values ensures that even if the sequence contains multiple negative numbers, the algorithm can still find the maximum product.
- This dynamic programming approach ensures correctness by considering all possible sublists through local maxima and minima updates.

Hence, the given implementation is correct for finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.
