Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This part correctly handles the edge case where the input list `xs` is empty, returning `float('-inf')` to indicate no valid product can be calculated.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. `best_so_far` is also initialized with the same value.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` starting from the second element of the list, we calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update Best Product:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop completes, this checks whether the current `max_ending_here` value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iterations.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program correctly accounts for the maximum product of sublists, even when the sublist contains negative numbers (which could turn a previously minimum product into a new maximum one, or vice versa). This is because both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated simultaneously to ensure that the state of the sublists is always correctly maintained.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given Python program is correct and will produce the expected result of finding the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True**
