Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   This initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop Through List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` stores the intermediate result of multiplying `max_ending_here` by `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to the value of `max_ending_here`.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling of Sublists:**
  The logic of updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that the program considers all possible sublists (both positive and negative products). 
  - When encountering a large negative number, it can potentially convert from negative to positive, leading to a new potential maximum.
  - Similarly, a large positive number can convert to an even larger one.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Empty list (`[]`): The function correctly returns `-inf`.
  - Single-element list: The function correctly returns the single element itself.
  - Lists containing zeros: If the list contains zero, the algorithm will treat each zero as a boundary and start anew from 1 (since `0 * anything = 0`).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, the code logic is sound and handles the problem requirements effectively. Thus, the provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
