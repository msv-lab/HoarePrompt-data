Correctness: True

Explanation:
The given program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`. Let's break down the logic and ensure each part works as intended:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where `xs` is empty by returning `-inf`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also set to the first element of `xs`. This means initially, the `best_so_far` value reflects the product of the entire list as if it were a single element (or zero elements if the list is empty).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each element `num` in `xs` starting from the second element, the program updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`, which acts as a "neutral" variable.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated using the maximum of three values:
     - `num`: In case the current element itself is the largest.
     - `temp`: This could be larger if there was a previous negative product (`min_ending_here`) which turned positive when multiplied by the current `num`.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: In case the current `min_ending_here` turned positive when multiplied by the current `num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is similarly updated using the minimum of three values:
     - `num`: In case the current element itself is the smallest.
     - `temp`: Could be smaller if there was a previous negative product (`max_ending_here`) which turned even more negative.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: Could turn negative if the product of two negative numbers results in a positive number.

4. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if so.

This approach ensures that both local maxima and minima (due to potential negative numbers) are considered, capturing all possible products of sublists within the input list `xs`.

Thus, the given program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
