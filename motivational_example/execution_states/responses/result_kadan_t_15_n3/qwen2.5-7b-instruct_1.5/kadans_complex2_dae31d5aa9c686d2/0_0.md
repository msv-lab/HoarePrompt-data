Let's go through the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Iterate Over the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list `xs` (excluding the first element):
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This logic ensures that we track both positive and negative products.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This helps to track potential negative sublists as well.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Return the maximum product found.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided code uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products at each point in the list. This helps handle both positive and negative numbers correctly.

- **Positive Products:** The algorithm keeps track of the highest possible product.
- **Negative Products:** The algorithm also tracks the lowest possible product so that multiplying it with a negative number can result in a large positive product.

The initial checks and the iterative process ensure that the function will correctly identify the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the logic and the steps taken, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True**
