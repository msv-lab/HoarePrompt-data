Correctness: True

### Explanation:
The given Python program aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a list of integers. Let's analyze it step by step to verify its correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty, by returning `-inf` as the maximum product.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to be the first element of the list, and `best_so_far` is also set to this first element.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` computes the product of the current number (`num`) and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` updates to the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` updates to the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

   This approach ensures that the state variables (`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`) keep track of the potential subproblems, enabling us to handle negative numbers and zero values correctly.

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   After the loop, it checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

This algorithm effectively considers both the maximum and minimum products at each step due to the presence of negative numbers and zeroes, ensuring it can find the true maximum product of any sublist.

Therefore, the given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers.
