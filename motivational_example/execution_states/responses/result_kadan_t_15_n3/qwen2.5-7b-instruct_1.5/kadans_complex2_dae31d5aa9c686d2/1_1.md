Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The given program aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list `xs`.

#### Key Components of the Program:
1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function first checks if the list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `float('-inf')` as per the problem statement. This makes sense because if there's no number to consider, we cannot form a product and thus return a very small number that indicates an invalid scenario.

2. **Dynamic Programming Variables:**
   - `min_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is crucial because if the product becomes negative (and we have large negative numbers), we need to remember the minimum so far.
   - `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position. This will help in determining the overall maximum product seen so far.
   - `best_so_far`: This is the global maximum product found throughout the iterations.

3. **Iterating through the List:**
   - The for loop iterates over each element of the list starting from the second element.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is used to consider the current element without any change from previous state.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Here, the maximum of three possible states is chosen: just the current number (starting a new sublist), `max_ending_here * num` (continuing the current sublist), or `min_ending_here * num` (considering a transition to a new minimum).
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Similarly, the minimum of three states is chosen.
   - These computations ensure that both the local maximum and minimum products are tracked correctly.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` will be updated to the maximum product found during the iteration.
   - The function then returns `best_so_far`, which holds the result.

#### Verification:
- The logic ensures that every sublist's maximum product is considered, including those starting at different points and handling edge cases like transitioning from minimum to maximum products and vice versa.
- The program efficiently handles negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears correct for the stated problem.
