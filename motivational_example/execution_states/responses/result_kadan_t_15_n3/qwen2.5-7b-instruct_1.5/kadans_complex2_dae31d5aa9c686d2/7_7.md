Let's go through the code step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of `xs`.

2. **Iteration through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After iterating through the list, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if true.

4. **Return `best_so_far`:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Correctness Verification

- **Initialization:** Setting the initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list seems reasonable since we need to start from somewhere and `xs[0]` makes sense for these values.
  
- **Iterative Update:**
  - The use of `temp = max_ending_here * num` helps keep track of both potential future maxima and minima based on multiplying with the current number `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is correctly updated to ensure it reflects the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position, considering both positive and negative numbers (due to the product with `min_ending_here`).
  - Similarly, `min_ending_here` correctly tracks the minimum product, ensuring it can also handle cases where the minimum becomes a new maximum due to negative multiplication.

- **Updating `best_so_far`:**
  - The check `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):` ensures that the best product found so far is updated if the current maximum ending here is better.

- **Return Value:**
  - Finally, returning `best_so_far` provides the answer to the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, the logic appears sound, and the implementation correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeroes.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
