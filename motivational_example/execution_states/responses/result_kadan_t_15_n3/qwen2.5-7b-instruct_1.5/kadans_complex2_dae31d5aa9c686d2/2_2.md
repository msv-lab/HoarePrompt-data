Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`xs`) as input.
   - It handles the case where the list is empty by returning `float('-inf')`.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

3. **Loop through the List**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `xs` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, the program calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` as follows:
     - `max_ending_here` is set to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is set to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return `best_so_far`**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Check

- **Initialization**:
  - The initializations `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list cover the base case of considering the entire list as a single sublist.

- **Handling Sublist Ends**:
  - By tracking both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the program can account for the possibility that a previously minimum product (when multiplied by a negative number) might become the new maximum product.

- **Iteration Logic**:
  - The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering the current element (`num`), the product with `temp` (which accounts for continuation of the previous sublist), and the cross-product (`min_ending_here * num`), ensuring all possibilities are covered.

- **Updating `best_so_far`**:
  - The final update ensures that the global maximum product is maintained throughout the iterations.

Given this analysis, the logic and steps of the program are correct and handle all necessary cases.

### Conclusion
**Correctness: True**

The given program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list of integers.
