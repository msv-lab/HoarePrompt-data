Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given integer list.

### Problem Description:
- Given an integer list `xs`.
- Find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) in the list.

### Function Analysis:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the best (maximum) product found so far.
   
2. **Loop through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one (`for num in xs[1:]`), update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
   - `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` with the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the case when multiplying by a negative number can turn a small product into a large one (or vice versa).
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` with the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After processing all elements, check if the last computed `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update accordingly.

### Correctness:
This approach is a variant of Kadane's algorithm but adjusted for both minimum and maximum products, which is crucial because a product can become positive by multiplying a small negative value by a large negative value.

The logic is sound and this algorithm works as intended for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python function `func_1` is indeed correct and effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.

```python
# Example Test Case
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output should be 6, as the maximum product is from the sublist [2, 3] or [-2, 4]
```
