The solution provided is generally correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. However, there's a minor mistake that needs to be fixed. Specifically, the `temp` variable is not needed, and it simplifies the logic slightly. Here is a corrected version of the function with some minor adjustments for clarity:

```python
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    if not nums:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = nums[0]
    max_ending_here = nums[0]
    best_so_far = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        
        # Update the variables directly without using temp
        max_ending_here, min_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num), min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(max_product_subarray(nums))  # Output: 6 (subarray [2, 3])
```

In this updated version, the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values are updated in one line without using an intermediate `temp` variable. This maintains the core logic but simplifies the code.

This function correctly handles all edge cases, including when the input list is empty or contains only negative numbers. It finds the maximum product subarray efficiently in O(n) time complexity.
