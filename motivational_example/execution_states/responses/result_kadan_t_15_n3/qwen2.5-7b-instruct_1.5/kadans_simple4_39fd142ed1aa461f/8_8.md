Let's analyze the provided solution to ensure it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list.

The given solution appears to use a variation of Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used for finding the maximum subarray sum. However, since we are dealing with a product rather than a sum, this logic needs to be adjusted to account for the impact of negative numbers on the product.

The core idea here is that the maximum product can change from negative to positive (and vice versa) due to multiplication with negative numbers. We need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, because a previously minimum product might become a new maximum when multiplied by a negative number.

Let's review the solution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` start with the first element.
   - `best_so_far` also starts with the first element.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element, we calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `max_ending_here` considering three possibilities:
     - The current number itself.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (since a small negative number can turn into a large positive number).
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to consider the smallest possible product (which helps handle negative numbers).

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes larger than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

Here is the provided code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the input list is empty.
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- This solution is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist.
- It correctly handles negative numbers and maintains both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position.
- The use of `temp` helps in deciding between keeping the current number, extending the previous max, or extending the previous min.

Therefore, the provided solution appears to be correct for the problem statement given.
