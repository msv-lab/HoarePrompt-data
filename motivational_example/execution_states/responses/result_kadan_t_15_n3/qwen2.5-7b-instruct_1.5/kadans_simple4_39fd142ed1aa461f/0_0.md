The provided solution is almost correct, but it can be slightly optimized and made clearer with some small adjustments. The core logic seems right: it uses dynamic programming concepts to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at each position, which helps in finding the maximum product of any sublist.

Here's the cleaned-up version of your function:

```python
def max_subarray_product(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        # Temporarily store max_end_here before updating
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        temp_min = min_ending_here
        
        # Update the values based on the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, temp_min * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, temp_min * num)
        
        # Update the best-so-far product
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far

# Example usage
print(max_subarray_product([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(max_subarray_product([-2, 0, -1]))   # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Variable Renaming**: Renamed `xs` to `xs` to follow Python naming conventions.
2. **Renamed Variables**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are renamed for clarity (though not strictly necessary).
   - `temp_max` and `temp_min` were added to temporarily store the previous state of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` respectively. This step ensures that the transition from one element to the next is clearly seen.
3. **Improved Clarity**: Added comments to explain the logic.

This version should work correctly for the given problem. It efficiently handles all edge cases and transitions through the array to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.
