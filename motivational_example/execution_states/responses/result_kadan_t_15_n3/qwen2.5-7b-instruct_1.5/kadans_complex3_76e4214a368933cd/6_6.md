To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's break down the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a list of integers.

### Logic Review
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These lines initialize three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. 

2. **Iteration**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating Best Result**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After iterating through the list, the `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns `best_so_far` which represents the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Verification
This approach is commonly known as the Kadane's algorithm with two pointers for handling both positive and negative numbers. It works correctly because it maintains a running `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` which allows it to handle sublists that start with a negative number and end with a larger positive number, effectively turning a negative product into a positive one.

### Test Cases
To further validate the correctness, we can test with some example lists:

```python
assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6
assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0
assert func_1([0, -1, 1, -3, 4]) == 4
```

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and logical steps taken, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the right approach to solving the problem. The implementation handles edge cases such as all negatives, positives, and zeros correctly.

Therefore, the provided solution is **Correct**. So, your assessment is:
- **True**
