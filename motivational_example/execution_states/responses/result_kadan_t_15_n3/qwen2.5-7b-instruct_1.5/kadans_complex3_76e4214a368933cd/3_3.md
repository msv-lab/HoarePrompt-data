The provided program seems to be aiming to solve the problem correctly, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The initial values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` should be initialized to `float('-inf')` instead of `xs[0]` because `xs[0]` might be negative, which would lead to incorrect results when comparing subsequent products.

2. The `best_so_far` should be updated only if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, and the condition should also check if `min_ending_here` is less than `best_so_far` to handle cases where the current minimum product can still produce a higher overall product when multiplied by a large negative number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = float('-inf')
    max_ending_here = float('-inf')
    best_so_far = float('-inf')

    for num in xs:
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

With these corrections, the function should work correctly. Given the original code and the logic flow explained in the comments, here is the corrected correctness statement:

**Correctness: True**

The corrected version ensures that all possible sublists are considered for both the maximum and minimum products, and it updates the best-so-far value appropriately based on these considerations.
