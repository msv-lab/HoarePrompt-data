The provided solution is correct. The algorithm effectively calculates the maximum product of any sublist by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position in the list. This approach accounts for the possibility that a negative number can turn a previously small product into a large one, and vice versa.

Here's the solution with some added explanation to clarify the logic:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # If the list is empty, return negative infinity since no product can be computed
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    # Initialize variables: min_ending_here, max_ending_here, and best_so_far to the first element
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary variable to store the product of max_ending_here and the current number
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of the current number, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of the current number, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and num
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is larger than best_so_far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # Return the best maximum product found
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Correctness

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
2. **Iteration**: For each element in the list, calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values considering the current number, the previous `max_ending_here` multiplied by the current number, and the previous `min_ending_here` multiplied by the current number. This step ensures that the algorithm can handle cases where a negative number turns a negative product positive.
3. **Update Best So Far**: If the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.
4. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the program finds the maximum product of any sublist, even in the presence of negative numbers.
