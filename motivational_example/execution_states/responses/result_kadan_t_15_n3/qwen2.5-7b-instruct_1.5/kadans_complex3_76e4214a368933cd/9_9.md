To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function, let's walk through it step-by-step and verify its logic against the problem description.

### Function Walkthrough:
1. **Initial Check**: The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf`.
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```

2. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of `xs`.
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```

3. **Main Loop**: The function iterates over each element in the list starting from the second element (`num in xs[1:]`). For each element:
   - A temporary variable `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```

4. **Final Update and Return**: After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated. Finally, `best_so_far` is returned.
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Verification:
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles an empty list correctly by returning `-inf`.
- **Logic Flow**: The approach used is similar to the Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray sum but adapted for the maximum product of any subarray.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The function correctly accounts for negative numbers, which can reverse the sign of products.
- **Efficiency**: The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, which is efficient.

### Conclusion:
Based on the walkthrough and verification, the provided Python function seems to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness:** True
