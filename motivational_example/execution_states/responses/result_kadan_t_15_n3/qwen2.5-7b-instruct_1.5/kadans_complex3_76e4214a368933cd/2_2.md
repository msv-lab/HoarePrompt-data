Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The solution uses dynamic programming concepts to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which is crucial because the product of a positive number and a negative number can turn into a larger (positive) product.

Here's a brief explanation of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both start with the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` also starts with the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - `temp` (which could potentially lead to a higher product if `max_ending_here` was positive)
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`) (which could help turn a large negative number into a large positive number)
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - `temp` (this keeps the potential lowest negative product for future turns positive if needed)
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`)

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all numbers, update `best_so_far` to the maximum value between itself and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the code correctly handles sublists with large negative numbers, zero, and both positive and negative numbers.

The states described in the comments correctly reflect the progress of the algorithm as it iterates through the list and updates the necessary variables.

Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
