The given program seems to solve the problem correctly based on the provided states and logic. Here is a step-by-step verification of the logic in the function:

### Problem Understanding
Given a list of integers, the goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the list.

### Function Analysis
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` is set to the first element of the list.
   - `max_ending_here` is set to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also set to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration through the list (`num`)**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second one:
     - Calculate `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the best-so-far product**:
   - After the loop, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge case handling**:
   - If the list is empty, it returns `-inf`.

### Execution States
- The states mentioned align with the logic of maintaining both the current maximum and minimum products of subarrays ending at the current index. This is crucial for handling negative numbers, which can turn large negatives into large positives.

### Correctness Check
- The approach correctly accounts for subarrays that might start from any position in the list and can end anywhere.
- It handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing only non-positive numbers.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given implementation should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the list.

Thus, the solution is **Correct**.

So, the answer is:
```
Correctness: True
