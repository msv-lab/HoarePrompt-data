Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works and ensures that all states and logic are properly handled:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity), which is the correct initial state since the product would be undefined or minimal when no elements are present.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Loop Through the List**: 
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element, the following steps are taken:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step accounts for scenarios where the maximum product can arise from continuing the previous sublist or starting a new one.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This helps in handling cases where the minimum product (which could later become the new maximum due to negative numbers).

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After processing all elements, the final value of `best_so_far` is returned, which holds the maximum product of any sublist within the given list.

This algorithm efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as edge cases like single-element lists or empty lists. Thus, the solution provided is indeed correct.
