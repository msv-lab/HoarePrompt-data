Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the given problem description and the annotated states. The logic in the function correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step verification of the correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, returning negative infinity as the result, since an empty product has no defined value and negative infinity makes sense as a placeholder for "no valid product".

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.
   
3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each subsequent number in the list, we calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated using the formula `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`, which considers all possible sub-products that can be formed up to the current number.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to consider the negative possibility.

4. **Update Best Result**:
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` is updated if the new `max_ending_here` is larger.

This algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, and it efficiently tracks the maximum product while also considering negative values (since multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one).

The final return statement correctly provides the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

Given the states and the steps described, the code meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the solution is correct.
