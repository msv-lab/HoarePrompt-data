The given program appears to be implementing Kadane's algorithm, but it does not seem to be correctly solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist. The issue lies in the logic used to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

### Corrected Version

To solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist, we need to consider the effect of negative numbers, especially how they can flip the sign when multiplied. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    # Initialize the state variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Update temporary values based on the current number, the product of max_ending_here and num,
        # and the product of min_ending_here and num.
        temp_max = max(num, num * max_ending_here, num * min_ending_here)
        temp_min = min(num, num * max_ending_here, num * min_ending_here)

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # Update best_so_far if the new max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version

- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list because these values represent the minimum and maximum products that end at the first position.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element, we calculate the potential maximum and minimum products that end at the current position by considering the current element alone and the products of the current element with the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Conclusion

The given code has a logical error in updating the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Therefore, the provided program is **incorrect**.
