The provided Python code is almost correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist. However, there's a small issue in the logic used to update the `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` values during the iteration over the list. Let's go through the annotated program and identify the correct solution.

### Annotated Program Analysis

Hereâ€™s the correct logic with proper annotations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers.
    
    if not xs:
        # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
        return float('-inf')
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: `num` is the current number from the list being processed.
        # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # The key insight is to use three-way comparisons:
        # - The current number itself.
        # - The product of the current number with `max_ending_here`.
        # - The product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
        # This ensures that we consider both positive and negative values.
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Similarly, to find the new `min_ending_here`, consider all possibilities.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is larger.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`.
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`.
    # `best_so_far` contains the overall maximum product of any sublist.
    return best_so_far
```

### Corrected Code
Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` start with the first element of `xs`.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent number `num`, compute three potential values:
  - `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`
  - The value of the number itself (`num`)
  - The product of the number and `min_ending_here` (`min_ending_here * num`)
- **Update Values**: 
  - Update `max_ending_here` with the maximum of these three values.
  - Update `min_ending_here` with the minimum of these three values.
- **Update Best So Far**: If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is accurately determined.
