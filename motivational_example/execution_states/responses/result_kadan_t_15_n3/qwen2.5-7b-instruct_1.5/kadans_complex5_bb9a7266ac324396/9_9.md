The provided Python function for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers is correct. Let's break down the logic and confirm its correctness through reasoning and a brief examination of the annotated states.

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This helps in managing both negative and positive products effectively.
  - `best_so_far` is also set to the first element. It keeps track of the highest product found so far.

- **Loop through the list**:
  - For each element in the list (except the first one), it computes three possible products:
    1. `temp = max_ending_here * num`: Continuing the previous sublist product.
    2. `num`: Starting a new sublist with the current element.
    3. `min_ending_here * num`: Turning a previous minimum product into a potential large product if the current element is negative.

- **Update state variables**:
  - `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated based on the computed `temp`.
  - If the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

- **Return the result**:
  - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Annotated Program with Corrections

Here's a cleaned-up version with corrected and slightly refined comments for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf when the input list is empty
    
    # Initialize state variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Compute temporary values for updating max and min ending here
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Example Execution States

Let's consider an example list `[-2, 0, -1, 3, 5, -6]` and follow the state changes:

- Initial state:
  ```python
  xs = [-2, 0, -1, 3, 5, -6]
  min_ending_here = -2
  max_ending_here = -2
  best_so_far = -2
  ```

- After processing the first few elements:
  ```python
  for num in xs[1:]:
      temp_max = max(0, -2*0, -2*0) -> 0
      temp_min = min(0, -2*0, -2*0) -> 0
      max_ending_here = 0
      min_ending_here = 0
      best_so_far = max(-2, 0) -> 0
      
      temp_max = max(-1, 0*-1, 0*-1) -> 0
      temp_min = min(-1, 0*-1, 0*-1) -> -1
      max_ending_here = 0
      min_ending_here = -1
      best_so_far = max(0, -1) -> 0
  ```

- Continuing this process for all elements, `best_so_far` will eventually be updated to `90` (from the sublist `[3, 5, -6]`).

This matches our understanding that the code works correctly to find the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, your provided solution is indeed correct.
