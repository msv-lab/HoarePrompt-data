The provided solution appears to be mostly correct but contains some minor issues and unclear comments. I'll explain and improve the comments for clarity and correctness.

### Problem Statement
Given a list of integers, the task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the given array.

### Corrected Program with Improved Comments

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf when the input list is empty.

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: num is the current number in the iteration, and temp is the product of the previous max ending here and the current number.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of three possibilities:
        # 1. The current number itself (start a new subarray),
        # 2. The product of the previous maximum and the current number (extend the existing subarray),
        # 3. The product of the previous minimum and the current number (flip sign and extend).
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here similarly, to account for the case where the minimum product might be larger due to negative numbers.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
    # State: After the loop, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any subarray ending at the last element of xs, and min_ending_here is the minimum product of any subarray ending at the last element of xs. 
    # If max_ending_here is greater than best_so_far, update best_so_far to be max_ending_here.
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: Return the maximum product of any subarray found.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of `xs`.
2. **Loop**: For each element in `xs` starting from the second one:
   - Compute `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
     - The current element itself (to start a new subarray),
     - The product of the previous maximum and the current element (to extend the existing subarray),
     - The product of the previous minimum and the current element (to flip the sign and extend).
   - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
     - The current element itself (to start a new subarray),
     - The product of the previous maximum and the current element (to extend the existing subarray),
     - The product of the previous minimum and the current element (to flip the sign and extend).
3. **Result**: Finally, we check if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

This approach efficiently handles cases where the subarrays can include negative numbers, ensuring the correct maximum product is found.
