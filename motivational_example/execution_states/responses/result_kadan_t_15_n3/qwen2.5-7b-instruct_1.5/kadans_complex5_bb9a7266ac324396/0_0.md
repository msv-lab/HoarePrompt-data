The provided solution is generally correct, but there are some improvements and clarifications that can be made. Let's break down the logic and the states to ensure the solution is accurate and clear.

### Problem Restatement:
Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided function `func_1(xs)` uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Here is the step-by-step analysis with added explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # State: xs is a list of integers.
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a non-empty list of integers
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary variable to store the product of the current number with the previous maximum ending here.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the minimum ending here and the current number.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the minimum ending here and the current number.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # State: After processing the next element, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` will hold the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current element, respectively.
    
    # Update the best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is larger than the previously recorded best.
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: best_so_far holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list, we calculate the potential new maximum (`temp = max_ending_here * num`) and update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current element and the intermediate results.
   - The key idea is to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position because negative numbers can flip the sign of the product.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is larger.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Return the `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Correctness:
The logic appears to be correct. The solution accounts for the presence of negative numbers which can affect the product. By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, the algorithm ensures it captures the largest possible product.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct and the steps are logically sound. The only suggestion would be to add more comments to explain why certain operations are performed, especially the updates to `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. This can help other readers understand the rationale behind these choices.
