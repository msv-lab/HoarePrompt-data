Let's carefully review the provided Python function to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Analysis of the Function

The function `func_1` uses the following logic:
- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- For each subsequent element, it updates these values to reflect the maximum and minimum products that end at the current element. This is necessary because negative numbers can turn large negatives into large positives or small positives into large negatives.
- Finally, it returns the highest product found during this process.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Function

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    return best_so_far
```

### State Comments

Your comments on the state transitions are accurate but could be slightly refined for better clarity:

1. **Initialization State**: The function starts with the first element of the list set as the initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`.

2. **Update Logic State**: During the loop, for each new element, it calculates a temporary product (`temp`), then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering three scenarios:
   - The number itself,
   - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number,
   - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   
3. **Comparison and Update State**: After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to the new value of `max_ending_here`.

4. **Final Return State**: The function returns the maximum product of any sublist, which has been tracked as `best_so_far`.

### Conclusion

The solution presented is essentially correct and implements a dynamic programming approach known as Kadaneâ€™s algorithm, adapted to handle subarray products rather than sums. The comments accurately describe the states of the function as it progresses through its logic.

The function should correctly identify the maximum product of any sublist in the input list. There are no apparent logical errors, and the approach taken is sound. 

To further validate the correctness of the implementation, you could test it with various test cases including edge cases like lists containing only negative numbers or zeros.
