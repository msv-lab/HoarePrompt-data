The provided Python function `func_1` does correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's review it step by step to ensure its correctness.

### Function Logic Review

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function first checks if the list is empty (`if (not xs)`). If so, it returns `float('-inf')`. This ensures that an empty list returns the smallest possible value.
     ```python
     if (not xs):
         return float('-inf')
     ```

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.
     ```python
     min_ending_here = xs[0]
     max_ending_here = xs[0]
     best_so_far = xs[0]
     ```

3. **Dynamic Programming Iteration**:
   - A loop iterates through the rest of the list (from the second element onwards).
   - For each element, three potential new states for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are considered.
     ```python
     for num in xs[1:]:
         temp = max_ending_here * num

         max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
         
         min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
     ```

4. **Update Best Solution**:
   - After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.
     ```python
     if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
         best_so_far = max_ending_here
     ```

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's analyze how this function behaves with different input cases:

- **Empty List**: It returns `-inf`, which is correct since no elements exist.
- **Positive Integers Only**: The function finds the largest number because all multiplications will yield positive results.
- **Negative Integers**: The logic handles this correctly, alternating between `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to find the overall maximum product.

### Summary

The provided solution is correct. It handles edge cases (empty lists), correctly initializes variables, and iterates through the list to maintain optimal states for sublists.

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

This implementation correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist.
