The provided solution is correct and it uses a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify the steps:

### Logic Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` all to the first element of the list.
  - The initial values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are set to `xs[0]` to start tracking the minimum and maximum products that end at the current element.

- **Iterate through the list**:
  - For each element `num` in the list (excluding the first one), calculate three values:
    - `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
    - `max_ending_here` as the maximum value between `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
    - `min_ending_here` as the minimum value between `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

- **Update the best product**:
  - After each iteration, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

- **Return the result**:
  - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Verification

The logic works because:
- **Minimum and Maximum Products**: The idea here is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products that end at the current position because a small number multiplied by a negative number can result in a large positive number, which might be the new maximum product.

### Execution States

Your commented code has correctly identified and documented the states at different points in the algorithm. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```

2. **Initializations**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```

3. **Loop through the list**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```

4. **Final Update and Return**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```

All these steps and conditions are logically sound and cover the possible cases where the product of elements changes due to the presence of negative numbers or zeros.

### Conclusion

Yes, the solution is correct based on the provided annotated comments. The code efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list of integers using dynamic programming principles.
