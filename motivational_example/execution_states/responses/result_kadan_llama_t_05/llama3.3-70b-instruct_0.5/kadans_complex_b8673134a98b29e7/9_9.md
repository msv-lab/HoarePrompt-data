Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly update the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated at each iteration of the loop, not just after the loop. 

Here's the correct code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

This code correctly updates `best_so_far` at each iteration of the loop, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
