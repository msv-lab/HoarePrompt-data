# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
2. The function correctly handles the edge case where `xs` is an empty list by returning negative infinity.
3. The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of `xs`.
4. The function then iterates over the rest of the elements in `xs`, updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step to keep track of the maximum and minimum product of sublists ending at the current position.
5. **However, there is a mistake in the update logic for `best_so_far`**. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop finishes, but it should be updated at each step if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
6. **Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the maximum product is a single negative number**. If all numbers in the list are negative, the function will return the first element, which may not be the maximum product.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far at each step
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
* **Updated the logic for updating `best_so_far`**: Now, `best_so_far` is updated at each step if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
* **No changes were made to handle the case where the maximum product is a single negative number**, as the updated logic for `best_so_far` already handles this case correctly.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 24
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output: 24
print(func_1([1, -2, 3, -4]))  # Output: 24
print(func_1([]))  # Output: -inf
```
