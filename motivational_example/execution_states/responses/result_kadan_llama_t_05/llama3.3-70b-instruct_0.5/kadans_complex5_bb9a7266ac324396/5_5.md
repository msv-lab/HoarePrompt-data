# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given problem is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
2. The provided solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product of sublists ending at each position.
3. **The issue with the solution is that it doesn't correctly update the `best_so_far` variable**. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated at each step to keep track of the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
4. **The solution also doesn't handle the case where the maximum product is less than the first element of the list**. This can happen if the first element is the maximum product itself.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far at each step
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
* **Updated the `best_so_far` variable at each step** to keep track of the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
* **Removed the conditional update of `best_so_far`** and instead updated it at each step to ensure that it always holds the maximum product.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))  # Output: 0
print(func_1([1]))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([]))  # Output: -inf
```
