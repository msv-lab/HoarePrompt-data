# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given problem asks to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.
2. The solution provided uses dynamic programming to track the maximum and minimum product ending at each position.
3. It correctly handles the case when the list is empty by returning negative infinity.
4. The solution iterates through the list, updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current number and the previous maximum and minimum products.
5. **However, the solution only updates `best_so_far` at the end of the iteration, which is incorrect**. It should update `best_so_far` whenever it finds a new maximum product ending at the current position.
6. The solution also correctly handles the case when a negative number is encountered, which can change the maximum product to minimum and vice versa.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far whenever a new maximum product is found
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
* **Updated `best_so_far` inside the loop**: Now, `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product ending at the current position is found.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 24
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output: 24
print(func_1([0, 0, 0]))  # Output: 0
print(func_1([]))  # Output: -inf
```

Correctness: **False** (The original solution was incorrect, but the fixed solution is correct.)
