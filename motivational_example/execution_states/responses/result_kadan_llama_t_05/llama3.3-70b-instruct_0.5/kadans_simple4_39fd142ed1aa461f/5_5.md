# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given problem asks to find the **maximum product of any sublist** in a given integer list.
2. The provided Python solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position.
3. The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are used to store the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position, respectively.
4. The variable `best_so_far` is used to store the maximum product seen so far.
5. However, there seems to be a **logical error** in the given solution. The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far: best_so_far = max_ending_here` should be inside the loop, not outside. This is because `best_so_far` should be updated at each step, not just at the end.
6. Moreover, the initial value of `best_so_far` should be set to `float('-inf')`, not `xs[0]`. This is because the maximum product could be negative if all numbers in the list are negative.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = float('-inf')
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
* **Moved the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop**: This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end.
* **Initialized `best_so_far` to `float('-inf')`**: This ensures that the maximum product can be negative if all numbers in the list are negative.
* **Updated `best_so_far` with the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`**: This ensures that `best_so_far` always stores the maximum product seen so far.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([2,3,-2,4]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-2,0,-1]))  # Output: 0
print(func_1([-4,-3,-2]))  # Output: 12
