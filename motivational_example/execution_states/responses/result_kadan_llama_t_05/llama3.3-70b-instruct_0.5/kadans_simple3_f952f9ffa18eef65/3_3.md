Correctness: **True** 

The given Python solution is correct. It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The solution maintains two variables, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, to track the maximum and minimum product ending at the current position, respectively. It also keeps track of the best product found so far in `best_so_far`. 

The solution correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity. It also correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step, considering the possibility that the current number could be negative and thus flip the maximum and minimum products. 

However, the given solution can be optimized. The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far: best_so_far = max_ending_here` is unnecessary because `best_so_far` is already updated to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` in each iteration. 

Here's the optimized version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```
