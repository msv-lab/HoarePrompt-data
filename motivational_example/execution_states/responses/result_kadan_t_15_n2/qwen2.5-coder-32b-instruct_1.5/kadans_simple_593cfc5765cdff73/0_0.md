To evaluate whether the provided code correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given list `xs`, we need to analyze its logic and implementation. The approach taken here resembles the algorithm typically used to solve problems of finding the maximum product subarray.

Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current index. They're important because multiplying a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest product encountered during the iteration so far.

2. **Iteration through the list (from the second element onward)**:
   - For each element `num`, the product `temp` of `num` and the current `max_ending_here` is computed. This value represents the product of the longest subarray ending at the previous index plus the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated as the maximum among three values: `num` itself (in case starting fresh with this number gives a better result), `temp` (the product of the longest subarray up to the previous index including the current number), and `min_ending_here * num` (the product that can become positive after multiplying a previous negative product).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated as the minimum among three values to keep track of the lowest possible products, which might turn into maximums upon subsequent multiplications.
   
3. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - If `max_ending_here` exceeds `best_so_far` after the iteration for the current number, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always carries the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function also includes a check for an empty list `xs` and returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) to signify that no product can be found from an empty list, which seems to address the boundary condition for such inputs.
  
After reviewing the above, it appears that the function follows the correct approach and logic to compute the maximum product of any sublist accurately. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
