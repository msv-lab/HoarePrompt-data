To determine the correctness of the program `func_1` for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list, let's walk through its logic step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`. This initialization correctly assumes that initially, the smallest and largest product ending at the first element are both equal to that element, and this value is also the best so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1). 
   - For each new number `num`, it calculates a temporary value `temp` which represents the potential new maximum ending here, considering multiplication of `num` with the previous maximum product.
   - It then recalculates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: the current `num`, the previous `temp` (maximum product), and the product of `num` with the previous `min_ending_here` (this handles negative numbers correctly, as a negative times a small negative number could be a large positive).

3. **Updating Min Value**:
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `num` with the previous `min_ending_here` to keep track of the smallest possible product (useful for subsequent multiplications).

4. **Comparison**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks whether this is larger than the current `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return**:
   - After completing the iteration over the entire list, `best_so_far` should indeed hold the maximum product of any sublist found during the traversal.

The logic seems consistent with the algorithm needed to solve the problem correctly by taking into account the possibility of changing signs (which would cause the maximum and minimum products to swap roles) during iteration through the list. No flaws were detected in the approach or implementation.

Correctness: **True**
