The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (or subarray) from a given list of integers. To determine its correctness, we need to evaluate whether it follows the necessary steps and conditions to solve this problem.

### Reasoning:
The core idea behind the solution is using dynamic programming principles where it tracks two states at each step (iteration over the list `xs`):
1. **max_ending_here:** the maximum product of a sublist ending at the current position.
2. **min_ending_here:** the minimum product of a sublist ending at the current position.

These states are essential because:
- The maximum product can be obtained by multiplying a negative number with the current minimum product, which turns into a maximum if the new number is also negative.
- We keep track of the minimum because it might turn into the maximum if multiplied by another negative number.

The key lines are:
```python
temp = max_ending_here * num
        
max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
```
This logic updates the maximum and minimum products for the sublist including the current number `num`. 

### Best So Far Update:
The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (highest) maximum product found so far, which is updated towards the end of the iteration when needed:
```python
if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
```

### Handling Edge Cases:
- An empty list is correctly handled by returning `-inf` which signifies that no valid product can be computed.

Overall, these mechanisms ensure that all possible contiguous sublists' products are considered effectively while minimizing unnecessary computations.

### Conclusion:
The given code logically addresses the task described in the problem statement by maintaining a running calculation of the maximum and minimum subproducts, updating them accordingly, and selecting the maximum possible result encountered throughout the process.

Thus, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
