To determine the correctness of the provided code, we need to understand the intended solution and validate whether the code aligns with that.

The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given integer list `xs`. To accomplish this, the code utilizes the "Kadane's algorithm" adapted for the multiplication case where both positive and negative products must be considered. The idea is to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current index, because multiplying a minimum product (which could be negative) by a negative number might yield the maximum product.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This seems appropriate because there are no sublists in an empty list, so the product doesn't exist.
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. This sets the context of starting from the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function then iterates through the rest of the list (i.e., from the second element onward).
   - For each number in the list, it calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This accounts for three possibilities: starting a new product with `num` alone, continuing with the existing maximum product and multiplying by `num`, or turning a negative product into a potentially large positive one using the smallest current product and the current number.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to account for potential new smallest products.

3. **Best Product Update**:
   - After each iteration step, the code checks if the `max_ending_here` value has exceeded the `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns the best product found (`best_so_far`).

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- The code correctly handles both positive and negative numbers in the list.
- By keeping track of both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the code can dynamically adapt to transitions that might increase the overall product by switching signs.
- Initialization and boundary conditions (empty list) are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in an integer list. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
