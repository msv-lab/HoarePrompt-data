To determine whether the program is correct, we need to understand the algorithm used and how it handles different scenarios in finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Explanation:
The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach where two variables (`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`) are kept to track the minimum and maximum product sublists ending at the current position as it iterates through the input list. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can change the sign, meaning a large negative product can become the largest positive product when multiplied by another negative number.

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product subarray ending at the current index.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product subarray ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` stores the maximum product encountered during the iteration.

Here’s the logic breakdown step-by-step:
1. If the list is empty, return `-∞` since there's no product that can be computed.
2. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
3. For each subsequent element, update `temp` as the current `max_ending_here` multiplied by the element (considering only positive products).
4. Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among the current element itself, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (which accounts for flipping the sign in the presence of negative numbers).
5. Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum value among the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
6. After processing the current element, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.
7. Return `best_so_far` which will contain the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- Handling empty lists.
- Positive-only or negative-only lists.
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers.
- Lists containing zeros, as zero will reset any existing product to zero.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the described algorithm and should handle the given problem accurately.
