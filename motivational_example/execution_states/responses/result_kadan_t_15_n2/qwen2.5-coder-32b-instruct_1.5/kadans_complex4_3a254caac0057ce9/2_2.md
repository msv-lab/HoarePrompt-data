The given solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`. However, there's a subtle flaw in the implementation: the variable `best_so_far` is only updated after the for-loop, whereas it should be updated at every iteration.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temporary max product
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max and min products ending at current position
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best so far if the new max product is better
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Corrections:
1. **Update `best_so_far` during each iteration**: 
   - In the original solution, `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop ends. Instead, `best_so_far` should be updated at each step to reflect the highest product encountered so far. This is crucial because the maximum product could occur anywhere within the list, not just at the end.

2. **State Comments**:
   - It might also help to add clarifications in the state comments regarding the updates made during each iteration.

### Example:
For the input `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function now correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist, which is `6` (from the sublist `[2, 3]`).

In summary, the initial solution has logical flaws that can lead to incorrect results. By updating `best_so_far` during each iteration, we ensure the algorithm captures the maximum product for any sublist within `xs`.
