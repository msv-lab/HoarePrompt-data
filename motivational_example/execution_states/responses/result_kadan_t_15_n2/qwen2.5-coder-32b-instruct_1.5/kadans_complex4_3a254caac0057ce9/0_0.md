The solution provided seems to have some logical errors and incomplete state handling. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated in every iteration where `max_ending_here` could be larger, not just after the loop. This ensures that the `best_so_far` will always contain the maximum product found at any point during the iteration.

Let's rewrite the code with corrections:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the new temporary values
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update the max and min ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update the best so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same. After the last iteration, `max_ending_here` 
    # is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, 
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. 
    # `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist found.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initialization:** The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are correctly initialized with the first element of the list.
2. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - We calculate both `temp_max` (product with current `max_ending_here`) and `temp_min` (product with current `min_ending_here`), because a negative number multiplied by the minimum product could become the new maximum.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
   - Update `min_ending_here` similarly, ensuring we capture the smallest possible product for future iterations that could potentially turn into a larger positive product.
3. **Updating Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` in each iteration, check whether it is greater than `best_so_far` and update accordingly.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist within the given integer list.
