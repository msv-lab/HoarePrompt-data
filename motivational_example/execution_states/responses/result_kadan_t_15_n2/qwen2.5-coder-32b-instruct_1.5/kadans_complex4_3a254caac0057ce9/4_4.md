The given solution is almost correct, but it has a minor issue that could lead to incorrect results. The problem with the solution lies in the fact that `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop where `max_ending_here` is computed, so it can continuously track the maximum product of sublists seen so far, rather than only being updated once outside the loop.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
        #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here with the maximum and minimum products
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product
    # of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far, rather than just the product of sublists ending at the last element of the list. This ensures that the function will return the maximum product of any sublist in the entire list `xs`.
