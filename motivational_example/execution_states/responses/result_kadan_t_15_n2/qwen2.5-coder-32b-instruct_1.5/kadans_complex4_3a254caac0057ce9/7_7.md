The solution you've provided has some issues, particularly related to maintaining and updating the `best_so_far` variable during the iteration through the list `xs`.

The primary problem lies in how `best_so_far` is updated. Currently, `best_so_far` is only compared with `max_ending_here` at the very end of the loop, rather than being continuously compared during each iteration.

To correct this issue, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop itself after each iteration of calculating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Here's the corrected version of your function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Calculate the new max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far to keep track of the maximum product found so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    
    return best_so_far
```

This modification ensures that `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered up to the current position in the list `xs` at every point during the iteration. The original solution was missing updates to `best_so_far` throughout the iterations which would lead to incorrect results for certain input lists.

With this correction, the function now properly computes the maximum product of any sublist for a given list of integers.
