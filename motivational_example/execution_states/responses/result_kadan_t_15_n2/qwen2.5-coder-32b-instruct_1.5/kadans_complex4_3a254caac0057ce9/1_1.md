The provided Python solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there's a minor issue with the current implementation that can be fixed.

### Issues:
1. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to keep track of the highest product found as we iterate through the list.
2. The initial state comment after the `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far)` check incorrectly indicates the state of `best_so_far`.

### Correct Solution:

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if xs is empty
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Calculate new max and min ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    #State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp_max is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    #       max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    #       min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    #       best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found throughout the loop.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- We initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- For each number in the list starting from the second one, we calculate the potential maximum (`temp_max`) and update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- We then update `best_so_far` with the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This solution now correctly tracks the maximum product throughout the list and handles negative numbers appropriately.
