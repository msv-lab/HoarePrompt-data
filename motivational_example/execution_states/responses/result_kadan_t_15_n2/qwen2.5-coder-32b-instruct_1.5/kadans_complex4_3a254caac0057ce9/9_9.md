The provided Python function `func_1` is intended to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given list of integers `xs`. However, there is a mistake in the implementation that prevents it from functioning correctly.

Here's the problem:

- The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, outside the loop, which means that it does not keep track of the maximum product encountered during the iteration over the list.

To fix this, we need to update `best_so_far` in each iteration where `max_ending_here` is calculated to ensure it reflects the maximum product of any sublist found so far. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update the max and min products ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in every iteration to make sure it holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far. This ensures the function correctly computes the desired result.

Let's look at the state annotations for better clarity:

- **State**: After the initial check, `xs` is not empty.
- **State**: After initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of `xs`.
- **State**: In each iteration of the loop, `num` is an element from the list `xs`, starting from the second element.
- **State**: `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
- **State**: `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
- **State**: `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
- **State**: `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum value among `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Final State**: When the loop ends, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

With these corrections, the function should work as intended.
