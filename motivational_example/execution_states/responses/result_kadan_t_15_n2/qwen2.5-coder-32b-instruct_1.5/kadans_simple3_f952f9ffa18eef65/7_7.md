Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist (contiguous subarray) within the given integer list `xs`. Here's why it's correct:

- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`.
  
- As it iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element, it calculates the `temp` which is the current `max_ending_here` multiplied by the next number in the list. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large positive number into a large negative number or vice versa.

- It then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` with the maximum and minimum possible products ending at the current position by considering the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  
- At the end of each iteration, it updates `best_so_far` with the greater value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is larger.
  
- Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product found over all sublists.

So the solution logic is valid, handling both positive and negative numbers properly.
