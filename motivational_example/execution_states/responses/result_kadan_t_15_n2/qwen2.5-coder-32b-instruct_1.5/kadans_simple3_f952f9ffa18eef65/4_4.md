Correctness: **False**

The solution provided has an issue with updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. Specifically, `temp` stores the value of `max_ending_here * num` but it should be used to calculate both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` correctly. However, the issue arises when calculating `min_ending_here` using the updated `max_ending_here`, which could lead to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary values before updating min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        # Update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are calculated based on the original values of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current iteration.
