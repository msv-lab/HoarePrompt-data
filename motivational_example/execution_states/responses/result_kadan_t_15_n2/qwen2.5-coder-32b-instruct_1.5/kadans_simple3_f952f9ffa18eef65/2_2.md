Reply Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (or subarray) within a list of integers. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number could turn a small minimum product into a large maximum product when multiplied. 

Here is a brief summary of the approach used in the code:
- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the array.
- Iterates through each number in the list starting from the second one.
- Updates the maximum and minimum products that can be obtained ending at the current position.
- Updates `best_so_far` if the `max_ending_here` for the current position is greater than the current value of `best_so_far`.
- Finally returns `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

The code also correctly handles edge cases such as when the input list is empty by returning negative infinity as specified.
