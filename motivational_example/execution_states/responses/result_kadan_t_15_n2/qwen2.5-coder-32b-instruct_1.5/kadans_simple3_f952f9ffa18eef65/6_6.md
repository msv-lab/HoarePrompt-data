Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the input list `xs`. 

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:

- The function starts by checking if the list is empty, returning negative infinity if it is, as there are no products to consider.
  
- It then initializes three variables: 
  - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the smallest product of sublists ending at the current position (this is useful because multiplying a negative number with a negative smallest product could become the largest product).
  - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the largest product of sublists ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` to store the maximum product found so far, which is initially set to the first element of the list.

- The function iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element. For each element `num`, it calculates two potential values:
  - `temp`, which is the product of `num` and `max_ending_here`.
  - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` (the product of the current number and the minimum product up to this point). This accounts for the possibility that multiplying the smallest product so far (a negative number) with the current number might yield the highest positive product.
  - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

- After the loop, `max_ending_here` will contain the maximum product of a contiguous sublist ending at the last element considered. The function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if it is, before returning it.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity and handles various edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros. Hence, the solution provided is correct.
