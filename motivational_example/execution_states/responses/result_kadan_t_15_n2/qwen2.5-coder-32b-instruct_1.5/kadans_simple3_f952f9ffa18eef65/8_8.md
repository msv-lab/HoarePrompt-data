Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a subtle issue. The variable `best_so_far` is not updated inside the loop correctly. It should be updated in each iteration of the loop to ensure that we are keeping track of the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This update ensures that `best_so_far` is always holding the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
