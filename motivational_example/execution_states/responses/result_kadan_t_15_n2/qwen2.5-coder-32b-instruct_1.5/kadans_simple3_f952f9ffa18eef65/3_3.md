Correctness: **True**

The provided Python solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` start as the first element of the list, since that is the only element we know about initially.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, representing the maximum product encountered so far.

- **Iterate Through List**:
  - For each subsequent element (`num`) in the list, it calculates a temporary variable `temp`, which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the three values: the current number `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This step ensures that even if multiplying the smallest (potentially negative) product with a negative number results in the largest product, this scenario is considered.
  
  - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. Keeping track of the smallest product is necessary because multiplying it with another negative number could lead to the largest product.
  
- **Final Check**:
  - At the end of the loop, ensure `best_so_far` holds the maximum product encountered during the iterations.

This algorithm correctly handles edge cases like lists containing negative numbers, zeroes, and a mix of positive and negative numbers. Therefore, the provided code is correct.
