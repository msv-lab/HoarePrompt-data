Correctness: **False**

The given solution has a logic error. The key idea in solving this problem is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. However, there's an issue with the way `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        # Temporary variable to store the current max_ending_here as we'll need it for calculating min_ending_here
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the effect of multiplying by num and also considering previous min product
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Check if we have found a new global maximum
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In the original code, `best_so_far` was only compared with `max_ending_here` after the loop ends, but we should update it inside the loop after recalculating `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found so far at each step.
