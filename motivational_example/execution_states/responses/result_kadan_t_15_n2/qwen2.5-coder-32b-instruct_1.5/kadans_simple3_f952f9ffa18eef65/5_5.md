Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) in the given integer list `xs`. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach where it maintains two variables, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, to track the maximum and minimum products ending at each index. This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far. 

Here's the key logic of the solution:
- Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
- For each number, calculate the potential maximum and minimum products that can be formed by multiplying the current number with the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` accordingly.
- Keep updating `best_so_far` whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds it.

Therefore, this implementation correctly handles all edge cases, such as lists containing zeros and negative numbers, to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.
