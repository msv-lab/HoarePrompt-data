Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as a subarray) in an integer list `xs`. Here's a step-by-step reasoning on why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The algorithm starts by initializing three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product of the sublist ending at the current index.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product of the sublist ending at the current index.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the highest maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate Through List**:
   - The algorithm iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), updating the minimum and maximum products that can be formed by including the current element.

3. **Update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**:
   - The current element (`num`) can either start a new sublist or extend the existing sublist. Thus, the new `max_ending_here` could be `num`, the previous `max_ending_here * num`, or the previous `min_ending_here * num` (since multiplying two negatives gives a positive number).
   - Similarly, the new `min_ending_here` is computed using the same logic but tracks the smallest possible product instead.

4. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - At each step, after computing the new `max_ending_here`, it checks if this value is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

5. **Handle Edge Case**:
   - The function first checks if the list `xs` is empty. In such cases, it returns negative infinity as specified in the problem context, meaning no valid sublist exists, which is an edge case consideration.

Therefore, this algorithm correctly identifies the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given list `xs`.
