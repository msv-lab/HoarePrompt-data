Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a list of integers. This is achieved by maintaining two variables, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, to track the maximum and minimum products up to the current position. The reason for keeping track of the minimum product is that multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product could result in a new maximum product.

The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest product encountered during the iteration. At each step, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number alone or the product involving the previous sublists, adjusting for possible sign changes due to multiplication by negative numbers. Finally, it checks whether `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

Thus, the function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
