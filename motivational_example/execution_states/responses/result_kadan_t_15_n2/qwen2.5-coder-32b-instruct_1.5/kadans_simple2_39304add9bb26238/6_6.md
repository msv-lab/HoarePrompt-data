To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine its logic in finding the maximum product of any sublist within the given integer list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how the code processes it:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to compute the maximum product of any sublist from a list of integers `xs`.

2. It first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity because there's no sublist to evaluate, and therefore no finite product to compare against.

3. It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of `xs`. These variables serve the following purposes:
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of the sublists that end at the current index.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product (which can become maximum when multiplied by a negative number) of the sublists that end at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product encountered during the iteration.

4. For every subsequent element in the list, the function calculates `temp`, which is the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`. This variable represents the candidate maximum product ending at the current index, assuming the previous sequence was also part of the product.
   
5. The code then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum among the current number itself (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This is necessary to account for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign, which could turn a previously negative `min_ending_here` product into a new `max_ending_here`.

6. Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum among the current number itself (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number, considering how the negative values can contribute to the minimum product.

7. After the loop, it ensures that `best_so_far` holds the maximum value encountered by comparing it to `max_ending_here` and storing the greater value in `best_so_far`.

8. Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should hold the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list `xs`.

This algorithm correctly accounts for scenarios involving negative numbers and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time using dynamic programming principles.

Thus, the correctness of the given program can be confirmed as **True**.

Correctness: **True**
