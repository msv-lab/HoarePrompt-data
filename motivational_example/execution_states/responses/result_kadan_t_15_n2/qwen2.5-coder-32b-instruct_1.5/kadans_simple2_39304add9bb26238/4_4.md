To determine the correctness of the provided Python function, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given list `xs`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic implemented by the function:

- It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the input list. 
- It iterates over each subsequent number in the list (`num`), updating these variables:
    - `temp` stores the product of the current `num` and `max_ending_here` from the previous step.
    - `max_ending_here` is then calculated as the maximum of `num` itself, `temp` (product of current `num` and previous `max_ending_here`), and `min_ending_here * num` (which can result in a larger positive number when `num` and `min_ending_here` are both negative).
    - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to track the minimum product subarray, which could turn into the largest when multiplied by a negative number.
    - Finally, `best_so_far` is updated with `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is larger than `best_so_far`.
- At the end, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray found during the iteration.

This dynamic programming approach ensures that we consider the effects of positive numbers increasing the product and negative numbers potentially converting a large negative product into a large positive product when multiplied again by a negative number.

Given the steps above, the algorithm is designed correctly to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist. Thus,

Correctness: **True**
