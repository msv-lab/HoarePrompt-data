To determine the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze its logic and compare it against the problem requirements.

The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) in a given list of integers. The program implements an efficient approach using dynamic programming, where `max_ending_here` tracks the maximum product ending at the current position, `min_ending_here` tracks the minimum product (important when there's a negative number that could turn a large negative product into a large positive one), and `best_so_far` stores the best maximum product found so far.

The logic in the loop:
- It multiplies the current `num` with `max_ending_here` and stores this in a temporary variable `temp`.
- Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `num` and `min_ending_here`.
- Updates `min_ending_here` similarly, considering `temp` to be the result of multiplying `num` with `max_ending_here` before it got overwritten.
- Finally, checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` after the loop ends, and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered, especially handling scenarios with negative numbers properly. 

After analyzing these steps, the provided code seems logically sound for solving the given problem.

Therefore, the answer is:
Correctness: **True**
