To determine the correctness of the provided Python function, let's go through its logic step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within the given list `xs`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized with the first element of `xs`. It keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position. This is crucial because a negative number multiplied by a small negative can turn into a large positive number.
   - `max_ending_here` is also initialized with the first element of `xs`. It keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` stores the maximum product found during the iteration. It is initialized with the first element.

2. **Iteration through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of `xs`.
   - For each number, we calculate a temporary value `temp` which represents the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number. This is used in deciding new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
     - the current number itself (`num`),
     - the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`),
     - the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
     - the current number itself (`num`),
     - the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`),
     - the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - After the above updates, if `max_ending_here` exceeds `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in `xs`.

### Verification of the Logic:
The logic correctly handles the potential of products involving negative numbers turning into positive ones when multiplied with another negative number. Also, it continuously updates the maximum product encountered.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which aligns with returning no finite product possible. 
- **Single Element List**: The maximum product would indeed be the single element itself.
- **Lists with Negative Numbers**: The function correctly calculates the maximum product considering both the highest positive and lowest (negative) products up to the current point, as well as transitions through multiplying by negatives.

After considering all these points, the program appears to be correctly implemented.

**Correctness:** True
