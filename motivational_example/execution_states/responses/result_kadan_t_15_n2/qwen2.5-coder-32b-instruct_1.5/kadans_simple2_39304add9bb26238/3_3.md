Correctness: **True**

Here's a step-by-step reasoning why the provided Python program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist (also known as contiguous subarray):

1. **Initial Setup**: The code begins by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) because there are no sublists from which to obtain a product.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`. Each of these is set to the first element of the list. 
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current index. It's necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a small (negative) product into a large (positive) one.
   - `max_ending_here` tracks the maximum product that can be obtained with the sublist ending at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` is used to keep track of the maximum product seen throughout the iteration.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: Starting from the second element, the code iterates through each number `num` in the list `xs[1:]`.

4. **Handling Negatives**: The code calculates `temp = max_ending_here * num` to account for continuing the maximum product from the previous element to the current one.
   - The `max_ending_here` is then updated using `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)` to determine whether to start fresh from `num` itself or to continue with `max_ending_here * num` or possibly `min_ending_here * num` if a negative `num` turns the `min_ending_here` product positive.
   - `min_ending_here` follows a similar logic but with `min()`.

5. **Updating Best So Far**: At each step, after updating `max_ending_here`, the code checks if it should update `best_so_far` by comparing it to `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` contains the maximum product seen thus far.

6. **Final Output**: After iterating through all elements, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within `xs`.

The algorithm efficiently solves the problem with a linear time complexity (O(n)), where n is the number of elements in the list, by using a dynamic programming approach. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be affirmed as **True**.
