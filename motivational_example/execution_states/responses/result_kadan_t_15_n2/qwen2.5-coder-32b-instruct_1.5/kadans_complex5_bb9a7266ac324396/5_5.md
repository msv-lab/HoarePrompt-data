The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. However, there is an issue in the implementation that needs to be corrected.

### Explanation of the Correctness:

#### Key Points:
- The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- It iterates through the list starting from the second element.
- For each element, it calculates the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number, storing this in a temporary variable `temp`.
- It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
- Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to track the minimum product up to the current point, which is necessary because a minimum product multiplied by a negative number could become the maximum.
- After iterating through the list, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, it updates `best_so_far`.

### Issue:
The main issue with the code is that `best_so_far` should be continuously updated inside the loop during the iteration through the list. In the provided solution, `best_so_far` is only compared and updated once after the loop ends, which means it misses the opportunity to track the maximum product encountered at each step.

### Correction:
To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original solution had a logical error due to the misplaced update of `best_so_far`. By moving the `best_so_far` update inside the loop, the solution now correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist. With this correction, the solution should be correct.
