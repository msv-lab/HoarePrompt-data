The solution provided has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be continuously updated within the loop whenever a new maximum product is found. Currently, the `best_so_far` variable is only updated once after the loop completes. This means that the function might miss updating `best_so_far` with a higher product encountered during earlier iterations of the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each number in the list starting from the second element:
  - Calculate `temp_max` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - Calculate `temp_min` as the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

- **Return**: After the loop completes, return `best_so_far`, which now contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the function keeps track of the highest product encountered at any point during the iteration, rather than just at the end.
