The provided Python code is intended to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical issue in the implementation. The variable `best_so_far` should be continuously updated during each iteration, as it needs to track the maximum product found so far, not just the initial value of the list or the final value of `max_ending_here`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), we calculate two temporary values:
     - `temp_max`: The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`). This handles the case where multiplying by the current number increases the magnitude positively.
     - `temp_min`: The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`). This helps in scenarios where the current number might turn a very small negative product into a large positive one.
   - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number itself, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number itself, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
   - We also update `best_so_far` to ensure it holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

With these changes, the function should work correctly for the problem statement.
