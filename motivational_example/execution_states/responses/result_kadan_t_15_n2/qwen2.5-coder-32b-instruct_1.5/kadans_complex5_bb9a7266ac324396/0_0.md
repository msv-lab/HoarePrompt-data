The provided solution is almost correct but there is a missing part in the loop where you should update the `best_so_far` variable within each iteration to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of your function with annotations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]  # This will store the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current index
    max_ending_here = xs[0]  # This will store the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current index
    best_so_far = xs[0]      # This will store the overall maximum product of any sublist

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Calculate new max_ending_here and min_ending_here including the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if a larger max_ending_here has been found
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far  # State: Returns the maximum product of any sublist in xs
```

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Updating `best_so_far`:** In the original solution, `best_so_far` was only updated once outside of the loop, meaning it only got updated if the last element of `xs` resulted in the highest product. By moving the update for `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it gets updated with the highest product found so far during each iteration.

2. **Annotations:** Annotations have been added to clarify the roles of each variable and the purpose of each line, particularly noting when `best_so_far` is updated within the loop.

With these changes, the code will correctly find and return the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
