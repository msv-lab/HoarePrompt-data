Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and determine if it is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Key Components:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates over the rest of the elements in the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the same three values. This is crucial because a large negative product can become a large positive product if multiplied by another negative number.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - After processing each element, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current value of `best_so_far`.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist, which is returned.

### Issues:

The current implementation has an issue with the handling of the `best_so_far` variable. It is only being updated at the end of the loop if `max_ending_here` exceeds the initial value stored in `best_so_far` (`xs[0]`). This logic doesn't allow `best_so_far` to update during the course of the loop if new maximum products are found during intermediate steps.

### Corrected Solution:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far at every step
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

### Summary:
The original code does not correctly update `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop. To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value within the loop. Once corrected, the function accurately computes the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
