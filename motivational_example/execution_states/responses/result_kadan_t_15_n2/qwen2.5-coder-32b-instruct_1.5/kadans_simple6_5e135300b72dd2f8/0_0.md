Correctness: **True**

The provided Python solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (or subarray) within the given integer list `xs`. The approach uses dynamic programming, maintaining two variables (`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`) to track the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position in the array. This is necessary because multiplying a negative number by a negative number can result in a larger product than either number individually. 

The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the highest maximum product found so far. At each iteration, it updates based on whether the new calculated `max_ending_here` exceeds it. The algorithm also handles edge cases like an empty list (returns `-inf`, indicating no possible sublist), which is specified per the problem statement. Therefore, this solution meets the requirements of the given problem accurately.
