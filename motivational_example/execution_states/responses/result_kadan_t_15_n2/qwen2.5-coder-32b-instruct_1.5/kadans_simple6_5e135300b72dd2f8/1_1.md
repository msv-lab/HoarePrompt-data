Reply Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. The algorithm keeps track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position, which is crucial since multiplying a negative number with the minimum product (a large negative number) could result in a maximum product (large positive number). This logic is well-implemented and aligns with the Kadane's algorithm adapted for products. The edge case of an empty list returning negative infinity is also correctly handled.
