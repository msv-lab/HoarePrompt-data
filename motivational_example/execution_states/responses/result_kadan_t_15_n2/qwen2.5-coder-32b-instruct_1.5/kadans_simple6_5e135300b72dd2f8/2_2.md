Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each index, which is necessary due to the presence of negative numbers that can turn large negative products into large positive products when multiplied by another negative number.

The comments indicating correct execution states also suggest that the code works as intended for those test cases. Therefore, based on the logic and the context provided, the solution is correct.
