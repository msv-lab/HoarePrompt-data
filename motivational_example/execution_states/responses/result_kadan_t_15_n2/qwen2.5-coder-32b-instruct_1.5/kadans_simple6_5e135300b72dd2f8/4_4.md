Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. It utilizes the dynamic programming approach where `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position, and `min_ending_here` tracks the minimum product (to handle negative numbers properly). `best_so_far` stores the maximum product found so far. The solution efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers in the list.

Here's a brief step-by-step explanation for clarity:
- If the input list is empty, it returns `-inf` as there are no sublists.
- Initialize `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- Iterate through the rest of the list starting from the second element.
- For each element, update `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
- Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
- Update `min_ending_here` similarly, taking the minimum instead of the maximum.
- At each iteration, ensure that `best_so_far` contains the largest product found up to that point.

The final return value of `best_so_far` will be the maximum product of any sublist in the given list. Therefore, the solution is indeed correct.
