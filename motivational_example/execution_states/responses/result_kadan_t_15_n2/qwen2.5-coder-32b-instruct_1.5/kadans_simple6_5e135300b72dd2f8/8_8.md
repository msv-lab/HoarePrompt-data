Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. 

The approach uses two auxiliary variables, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- For each subsequent element in the list, it updates `temp` to the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element (`num`).
- It then updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
- Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
- Finally, after iterating through the list, it updates `best_so_far` with `max_ending_here` if it is greater than `best_so_far`.
- It returns `best_so_far`, which will be the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

This method efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity. The given solution works correctly for all valid inputs, including those with negative numbers and zeros. Therefore, the solution is correct.
