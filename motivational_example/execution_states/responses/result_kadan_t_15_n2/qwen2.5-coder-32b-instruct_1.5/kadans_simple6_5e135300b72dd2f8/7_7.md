Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. This algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach, keeping track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position to account for the effect of negative numbers which can turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied by another negative number. The solution also handles edge cases, such as empty lists, by returning negative infinity, indicating that no product can be computed from an empty list. The final comparison and update of `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found throughout the iteration is returned as the result.
