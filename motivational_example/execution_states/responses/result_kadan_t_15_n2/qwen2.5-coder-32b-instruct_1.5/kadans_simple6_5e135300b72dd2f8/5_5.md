Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. This solution utilizes dynamic programming principles by keeping track of both the maximum (`max_ending_here`) and minimum (`min_ending_here`) products ending at each position in the list. The reason for maintaining the minimum product is to account for the possibility of a large negative number being multiplied by a previously smallest (most negative) product, resulting in a large positive product. 

The comments indicating expected outcomes during execution align with the logic of the code and its intended functionality, further supporting the correctness of this implementation. Therefore, based on the description and code provided, the solution is correct.
