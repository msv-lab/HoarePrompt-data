To determine if the solution is correct, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If so, it returns `-inf` because an empty list has no sublist that can produce a product, and using `-inf` as the "best so far" product handles this gracefully.
   - It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum product sublists starting at the first element will both be that element initially.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates over the rest of the elements in the list.
   - For each element, `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`. This represents what the product of the current max_ending_here sublist would become if it were to include the current number.
   - The new value of `max_ending_here` is determined as the maximum of `num` (starting a new sublist with the current number), `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` (in case the current min_ending_here is negative, multiplying by `num` could result in a large positive number).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated as the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` to keep track of the minimum product sublists that could potentially grow larger when multiplied by subsequent negative numbers.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After iterating through all elements, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
   - This ensures that after examining all sublists, the highest possible product found is stored in `best_so_far`.

Based on this analysis, the logic appears to correctly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program can be assessed as:
Correctness: **True**
