Correctness: **False**

The program contains a small issue that needs correction. While the logic of keeping track of both the minimum (`min_ending_here`) and maximum (`max_ending_here`) products up to the current position is correct, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated during each iteration through the loop, rather than only after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf if the input list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update the best_so_far with the max value between the current best and the max product ending here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found.
    return best_so_far
```

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop after each iteration, you ensure that you capture the maximum product of any sublist encountered throughout the list, not just the maximum product ending at the final element.
