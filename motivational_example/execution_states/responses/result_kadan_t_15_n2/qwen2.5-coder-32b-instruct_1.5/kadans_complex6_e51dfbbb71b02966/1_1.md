Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The current implementation of `func_1` does not keep updating the `best_so_far` variable during each iteration, which is necessary to track the maximum product found throughout the list. It only checks once at the end of the loop if the last computed `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
        # State: xs is an empty list, so return negative infinity as there's no sublist product

    # State: xs is a non-empty list of integers
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)

        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            # Update `best_so_far` if the new `max_ending_here` is greater

    # Final state: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, 
    # temp_max is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
    # `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist found in the list.
    
    return best_so_far
```

This revised version correctly updates `best_so_far` inside the loop whenever a new maximum product ending at the current element is found. This ensures that by the end of the loop, `best_so_far` truly represents the maximum product of any sublist in the entire input list `xs`.
