Correctness: **False**

The solution provided does not keep track of the `best_so_far` variable during each iteration, meaning it may not correctly update the maximum product found so far when encountering sublists with larger products later in the list.

Here's the corrected version with annotations:
```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf for an empty list.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)  # Update max product ending at this point
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)  # Update min product ending at this point
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)  # Update the overall best max product so far
        
    # Final state: xs is still the original list of integers;
    # min_ending_here and max_ending_here reflect the last element's computations.
    # best_so_far has been updated through the loop to hold the max product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

In the above correction, `best_so_far` is continuously updated with the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` inside the loop to ensure that the overall maximum product encountered so far is tracked correctly.
