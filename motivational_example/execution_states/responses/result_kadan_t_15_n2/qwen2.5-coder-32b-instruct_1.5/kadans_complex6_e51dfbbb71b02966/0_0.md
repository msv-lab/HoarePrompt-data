Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop, meaning it may miss out on the maximum product of sublists that end at elements before the last one. 

The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it keeps track of the maximum product found so far throughout all sublists, not just those ending at the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this modification, `best_so_far` will be correctly updated during each iteration, ensuring it always holds the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
