Correctness: **False**

The given program has an issue in how it keeps track of the best product found so far (`best_so_far`). While the logic to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element is correct, the program does not consistently update `best_so_far` during each iteration. It should continuously check whether the current `max_ending_here` is the highest found so far and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop after updating `max_ending_here`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        # Update max_ending_here with max of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update min_ending_here with min of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Continuously update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # best_so_far is the highest maximum product of any sublist found throughout the iteration.
    
    return best_so_far
```

This change ensures that the `best_so_far` variable always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered in the list.
