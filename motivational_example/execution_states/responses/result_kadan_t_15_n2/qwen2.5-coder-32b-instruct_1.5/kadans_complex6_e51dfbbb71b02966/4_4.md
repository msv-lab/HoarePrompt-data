Correctness: **False**

The given Python function aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers. The implementation contains logical errors that prevent it from working correctly. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated in every iteration if `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, rather than just after the loop ends. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

The critical change made here is the inclusion of an `if` statement to update `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` exceeds `best_so_far`. This ensures that `best_so_far` is always holding the maximum product encountered throughout the iteration process.
