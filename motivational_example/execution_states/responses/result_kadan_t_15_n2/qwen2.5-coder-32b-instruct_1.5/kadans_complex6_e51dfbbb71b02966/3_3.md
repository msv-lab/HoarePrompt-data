Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a logic flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration to store the maximum product found so far, rather than just comparing `max_ending_here` at the end of the loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers; min_ending_here is the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element of xs; max_ending_here is the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element of xs. best_so_far holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

By updating `best_so_far` within the loop after recalculating `max_ending_here`, the program correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist across all elements in the list.
