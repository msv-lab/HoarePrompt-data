Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program has a critical error in how it tracks the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` variable is only updated once, after the loop ends, and that too only when `max_ending_here` from the final iteration is greater than `best_so_far`. It should be continuously updated throughout the loop to ensure it always stores the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

To correct this, the line:

```python
if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
```

Should be placed inside the `for` loop:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the first element of xs and updated during each loop to be the max found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

This change ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the traversal of the list.
