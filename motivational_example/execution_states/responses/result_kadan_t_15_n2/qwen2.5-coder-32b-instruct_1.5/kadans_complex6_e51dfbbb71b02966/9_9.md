**Correctness:** **False**

The current implementation does not correctly keep track of the best product found so far. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated at each step of the loop to store the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far. However, the provided code only updates it after the loop if `max_ending_here` at the end of the list is greater than the initial element.

To fix this, you need to update the `best_so_far` inside the loop whenever a new maximum product ending at the current index is found.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        #Update both max and min, because the negative numbers can turn the minimum to a maximum.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        #Keep track of the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    #State: After processing all elements, best_so_far holds the maximum product of any sublist.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that `best_so_far` is always updated to the maximum product of any sublist ending at any position in the list, not just the end.
