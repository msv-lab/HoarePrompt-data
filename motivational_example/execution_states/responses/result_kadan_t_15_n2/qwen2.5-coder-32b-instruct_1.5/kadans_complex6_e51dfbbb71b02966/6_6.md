Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution almost solves the problem, but it has one key issue: it does not update the `best_so_far` during the loop. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once, after the loop has finished, based on the last computed `max_ending_here`. This approach fails to account for sublists that yield maximum products at earlier positions in the list.

To correctly find the maximum product of any sublist, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop whenever a larger product (`max_ending_here`) is found. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`,
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `best_so_far` is the largest maximum product found in any sublist.
    return best_so_far
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist within the given list.
