The solution you provided aims to find the maximum product of any sublist (or contiguous subarray) in a given integer list. The approach used is dynamic programming, which keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the array. This is because multiplying a negative number with the minimum product could yield a higher positive product.

Let's break down the solution to verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of subarrays that end at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent number in the list, calculate the temporary product (`temp`) as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, the temporary product, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the same three values. This helps in cases where two negatives might make a large positive number, so we need to consider this combination too.
   
3. **Final Update**:
   - After processing all numbers, update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

The solution logic is correct based on the dynamic programming approach. However, there is one small optimization that can be made. The final check `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` and assignment `best_so_far = max_ending_here` can be removed as the maximum product ending at the last element will naturally be checked during the iteration. The last value of `max_ending_here` should already be considered in `best_so_far`.

Here's the optimized version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This revised solution should work correctly and efficiently to solve the problem as described.
