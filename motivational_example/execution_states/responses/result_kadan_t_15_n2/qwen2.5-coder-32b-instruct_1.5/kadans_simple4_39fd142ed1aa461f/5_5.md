The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The algorithm used is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. However, this adaptation handles products, taking into account the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.

Here is a step-by-step review of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
     - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position (which can become a large positive product when multiplied by a negative number).
     - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far` stores the maximum product found so far.
     
2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from the second element and goes through each element in the list.
   - For each number, it calculates `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the number.
   - Then it updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current number itself, `temp` (previous max product multiplied by the current number), and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (to handle negative numbers turning a small negative product into a large positive one).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to handle potential sign flips.

3. **Update best-so-far**:
   - After processing each number, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, it returns `-inf` which seems unconventional but can be considered valid for indicating no possible product.

The logic appears to be correctly implemented according to the described algorithm. It efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input list.

However, the function should probably return 0 for an empty list since the maximum product of an empty list of numbers isn't really defined in a product sense. Returning 0 might be more intuitive and aligned with common expectations in practical scenarios.

Here's the adjusted code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return 0  # or handle differently based on context
  
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With these considerations, the solution should work correctly for the given problem statement.
