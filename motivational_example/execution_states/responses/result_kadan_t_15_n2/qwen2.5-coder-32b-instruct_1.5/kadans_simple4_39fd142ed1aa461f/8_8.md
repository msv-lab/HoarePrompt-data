The provided solution is almost correct but has a small oversight. The main idea behind this solution is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current element. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a small (minimum) product into a large (maximum) product and vice versa.

Here's a breakdown of what the solution does and why it might need some adjustment:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each subsequent number in the list, it calculates a `temp` value as the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`. This handles the case where a negative number turns the smallest product into the largest.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.

3. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Why the Solution Might Be Missing a Step

- The update for `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop after calculating `max_ending_here`. The current code checks only once after the loop ends, which is incorrect because `max_ending_here` could have changed to a larger value during any iteration that wasn't the last one.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that we capture the maximum product of any sublist, regardless of whether it ends at the last element or not.
