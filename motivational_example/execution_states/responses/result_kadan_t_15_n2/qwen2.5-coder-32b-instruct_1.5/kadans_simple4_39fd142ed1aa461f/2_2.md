The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming by keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one, or vice versa.

Let's break down the code and check its correctness step-by-step:

### Code Explanation:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the list `xs` is empty, it returns negative infinity. This is reasonable as there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables store the minimum product, maximum product ending at the current index, and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively. Initialized with the first element of the list.

3. **Iteration**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, the following steps occur:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

4. **Updating Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater.

5. **Return Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Correctness:

The logic of the code is correct. The algorithm efficiently computes the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in O(n) time complexity using a single pass through the list. It correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position, ensuring that any transition from negative to positive or vice versa is considered.

### Edge Cases:

- **Empty List**: Correctly handled by returning negative infinity.
- **List with One Element**: Will return that single element, which is correct.
- **All Negative Numbers**: It will still find the correct maximum product, even if it is a single negative number.
- **Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum product by considering transitions caused by negative numbers.

### Conclusion:

Yes, the solution is correct. It efficiently finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the list of integers using a well-thought-out dynamic programming approach.
