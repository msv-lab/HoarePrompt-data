The provided Python function aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as a subarray) within a given integer list. The approach uses a dynamic programming technique where it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, as the minimum product can become the maximum product if multiplied by a negative number.

Let's break down the code and see if it handles all edge cases correctly:

### Code Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.
  
- **Iteration**:
  - For each subsequent element `num` in the list, calculate `temp` which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: `num` (if `num` itself is larger), `temp` (if continuing the existing maximum subarray), or `min_ending_here * num` (if flipping from negative to positive product).
  - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

- **Final Check**:
  - After iterating through the list, update `best_so_far` to the maximum value between itself and `max_ending_here`.

- **Return**:
  - Return `best_so_far` as the result, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist found.

### Correctness and Edge Cases:
The code correctly handles most edge cases such as negative numbers, zeros, and single-element lists.

However, there is a slight inefficiency in updating `best_so_far`. The update should happen during each iteration step, rather than just once after the loop. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update the max and min products for the current subarray ending at 'num'
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Track the best product seen so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This modification ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any subarray found up to the current position, which guarantees the correctness of the final result. 

### Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the function:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))        # Expected output: 6 (subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))          # Expected output: 0 (subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))          # Expected output: 24 (subarray [-2, 3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -1, 3, -4, 2])) # Expected output: 96 (subarray [2, -1, 3, -4, 2])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -9, -6]))     # Expected output: 108 (subarray [-9, -6])
print(func_1([5]))                  # Expected output: 5 (single element array)
```

All these test cases should pass with the corrected code.
