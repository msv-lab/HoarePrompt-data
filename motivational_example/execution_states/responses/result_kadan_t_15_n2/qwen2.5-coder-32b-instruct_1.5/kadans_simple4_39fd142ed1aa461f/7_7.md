The provided solution is mostly correct, but it can be optimized slightly. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one.

However, there's a small improvement you can make to the code. Instead of checking `if max_ending_here > best_so_far` after the loop, you can update `best_so_far` within the loop whenever a new `max_ending_here` is calculated that is greater than `best_so_far`. Here is the corrected and slightly optimized version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # If the current number is negative, swapping max and min will handle it
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This version directly updates `best_so_far` during each iteration if `max_ending_here` exceeds it, making the final check outside the loop unnecessary. This change doesn't affect the time complexity (which is O(n)), but it does slightly simplify the code.
