The solution provided attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. However, there's a small mistake in the logic. Specifically, `max_ending_here` should be updated after `min_ending_here` because `temp` relies on the previous value of `max_ending_here`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # or 0 if you prefer to handle empty list cases differently

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # temp stores the current num * previous max_ending_here product
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here considering the possibility of num starting a new sublist or including the previous max or min product
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here considering the same possibilities as max_ending_here but tracking the minimum
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points:
- **Handling Empty List**: The initial condition returns `float('-inf')` if the list is empty. This assumes that no valid product can be formed.
- **Updating `min_ending_here` First**: Since `temp` is used to calculate `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here` should be updated first before `max_ending_here` to ensure the logic is consistent.
- **Tracking Both Minimum and Maximum**: We keep track of both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to handle cases where multiplying by a negative number could flip the sign and result in a larger product than previously seen.

This corrected function should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.
