The solution provided attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. However, there are some issues with the implementation that need to be addressed.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**:
   - The code initializes both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` with the first element of the list. While this is correct in some contexts, it doesn't handle cases where the product might involve negative numbers. It is crucial to consider initializing them to `1` to correctly account for products that can flip signs due to negative numbers.

2. **Logic for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**:
   - When updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the current number itself should also be considered separately from the product calculations (since a sublist could simply consist of a single element).
   - The code correctly considers all three possibilities (current number, current number multiplied by `max_ending_here`, and current number multiplied by `min_ending_here`), but needs proper initialization and logic for `best_so_far`.

3. **Updating `best_so_far` inside the loop**:
   - Instead of waiting to update `best_so_far` outside the loop, you should update it inside the loop after adjusting `max_ending_here` for each iteration.

### Corrected Solution:
Below is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    if not nums:
        return float('-inf')  # Handle the case when the list is empty

    # Initialize these variables to 1, not to nums[0].
    max_ending_here = 1
    min_ending_here = 1
    best_so_far = nums[0]

    for num in nums:
        # If the current number is negative, swap max and min
        if num < 0:
            max_ending_here, min_ending_here = min_ending_here, max_ending_here
        
        # Update max and min products ending at the current position
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are initialized to `1` because we are dealing with products, and multiplying by `1` will not alter the values.
- **Swapping on Negative Numbers**: When encountering a negative number, the maximum product can become minimum, and vice versa, so `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are swapped.
- **Updating Best So Far**: The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the highest product found at any point in the array.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum product of any sublist with a time complexity of O(n).
