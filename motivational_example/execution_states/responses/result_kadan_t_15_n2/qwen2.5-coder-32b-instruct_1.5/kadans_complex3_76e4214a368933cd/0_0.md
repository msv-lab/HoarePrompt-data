Correctness: **False**

The provided solution contains a flaw that prevents it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist in all cases. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable is only updated once, at the end of the loop, if `max_ending_here` exceeds its initial value (the first element of `xs`). 

The issue arises when the sublist with the maximum product does not include the first element, and its maximum product is found during the intermediate iterations. In this case, the `best_so_far` will not capture the correct maximum product.

To fix the program, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated during each iteration to keep track of the highest maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
        # Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` within each iteration.
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element of `xs`. `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest maximum product found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function now correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
