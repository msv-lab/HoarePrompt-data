Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error. It updates `best_so_far` only at the end of the loop without updating it within the loop, which might result in a situation where the maximum product occurs somewhere in the middle but is not captured.

Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses this issue by updating `best_so_far` during each iteration:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if xs is empty
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        #Update best_so_far here, to make sure we capture the maximum product seen so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs,
    # temp_max is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # temp_min is the product of min_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, `best_so_far` is always updated during each iteration if `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, ensuring that it captures the maximum product found across all sublists.
