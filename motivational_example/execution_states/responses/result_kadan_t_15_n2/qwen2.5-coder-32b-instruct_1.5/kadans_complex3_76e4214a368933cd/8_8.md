Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has an issue. It initializes `best_so_far` to the first element of the list but only updates it once at the end of the loop, meaning it won't always store the maximum product of any sublist throughout the iterations.

To correct this, `best_so_far` should be updated at each step if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far after updating max_ending_here
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

With this update, `best_so_far` is correctly updated to store the maximum product of any sublist encountered throughout the iterations.
