Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the way it keeps track of the maximum product so far (`best_so_far`). The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration to keep track of the highest maximum product found as the algorithm progresses through the list.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to keep track of the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- `best_so_far` needs to be updated within the loop with `max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)` in order to track the global maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, rather than only comparing at the end of the loop. 

With these corrections, the function should provide the correct result for the problem statement.
