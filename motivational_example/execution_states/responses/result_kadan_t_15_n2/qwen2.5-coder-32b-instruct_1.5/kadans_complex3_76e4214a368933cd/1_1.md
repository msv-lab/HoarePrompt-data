Correctness: **False**

The given solution has a logical error. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop after the `max_ending_here` value has been recalculated in each iteration, rather than after the loop ends.

Here's the corrected version of the function with appropriate annotations and logic:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far after calculating the new max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same; `num` is the last element of `xs`; 
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration;
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found in any sublist so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is compared and possibly updated during each iteration based on the latest `max_ending_here`. This ensures that the global maximum product of any sublist is recorded and returned.
