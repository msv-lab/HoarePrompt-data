Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a logical issue that it doesn't update `best_so_far` within the loop after each iteration. This means it only compares the `best_so_far` against the `max_ending_here` of the final iteration. It should update `best_so_far` with the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` at each step of the loop to ensure it tracks the global maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far after each iteration
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum value of itself and `max_ending_here` after processing each element, ensuring that the largest product of any sublist is captured.
