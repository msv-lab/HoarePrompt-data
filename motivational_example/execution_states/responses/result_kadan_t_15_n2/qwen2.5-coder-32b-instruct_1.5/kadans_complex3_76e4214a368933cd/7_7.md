Correctness: **False**

The given solution is mostly correct but there is one critical issue. Specifically, it doesn't correctly update the `best_so_far` variable inside the loop after each iteration.

Here's what needs to be corrected:

The current implementation updates the `best_so_far` only after exiting the loop, comparing it only with the final value of `max_ending_here`. However, the maximum product could occur at any point during the traversal of the list, not just at the end. Therefore, we need to continuously check whether `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` within each iteration of the loop.

Let's modify the code accordingly:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
        #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far after calculating max_ending_here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`.
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, the program will correctly keep track of the maximum product encountered during the entire traversal of the list, making sure that `best_so_far` always holds the highest product of any sublist encountered so far.
