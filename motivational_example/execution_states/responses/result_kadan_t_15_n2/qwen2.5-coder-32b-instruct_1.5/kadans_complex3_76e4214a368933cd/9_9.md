Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, but it should be updated during each iteration if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` to ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the last element.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated whenever a new maximum product of any sublist is found during the iterations.
