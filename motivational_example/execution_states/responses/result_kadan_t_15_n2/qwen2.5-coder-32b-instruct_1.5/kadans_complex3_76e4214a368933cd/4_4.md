Correctness: **False**

The solution is incorrect because the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. However, during each iteration, `max_ending_here` could represent the maximum product of any sublist that ends at the current position, so it should be compared against `best_so_far` in every iteration to ensure `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found so far.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far after each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found.
    return best_so_far
```

With this modification, `best_so_far` will always contain the maximum product of any sublist by the end of the function execution.
