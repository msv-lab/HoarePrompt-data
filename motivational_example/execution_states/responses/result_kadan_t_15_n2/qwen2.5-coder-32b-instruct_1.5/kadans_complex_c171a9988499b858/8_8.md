Correctness: **False**

The program contains a flaw in its final comments regarding the state. Specifically, the comment after the conditional update of `best_so_far` is not entirely accurate. 

At that point in the program, `best_so_far` is meant to track the maximum product of any sublist found so far, not just the one that ends at the current element. The loop iteratively updates `best_so_far` when it encounters a new maximum in `max_ending_here`.

Here's the corrected version of the relevant comment:

```python
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; 
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`;
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray encountered so far.
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; 
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`;
    # If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.
    # Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
```

However, this doesn't change the correctness of the program's logic. It's merely correcting a comment for clarity.

So if we're evaluating the program's logic alone (ignoring the slight inaccuracy in the comment), the code is correct and would compute the maximum product of any sublist as described. The answer regarding the program's correctness in fulfilling its intended function would still be **True**, but the comment needs a minor clarification.

Since the question explicitly asks whether the provided comments along with the program logic align correctly, we must answer:

Correctness: **False**
