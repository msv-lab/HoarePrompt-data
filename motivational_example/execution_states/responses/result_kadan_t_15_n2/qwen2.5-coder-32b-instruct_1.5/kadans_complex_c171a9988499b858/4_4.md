Reply Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotations in the program are not entirely correct in terms of the states they describe, and the logic to update `best_so_far` needs some attention.

1. After iterating through the list, `best_so_far` should be updated in every iteration where `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. The current program only checks once after the loop ends which might miss out on the global maximum if it happens later in the array.

2. Here's how the corrected function should look like:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here to ensure we're tracking the max product across all subarrays
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far in any subarray.
    return best_so_far
```
3. In this version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration of the loop, ensuring that it reflects the maximum product of any subarray seen up to the current element. This aligns with the requirement to find the maximum product of any sublist.
