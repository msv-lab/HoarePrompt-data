Correctness: **False**

The issue in the program lies in the final comments describing the state after the comparison and update involving `best_so_far`. The comment states that if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated, but it does not reflect that `best_so_far` is updated at every iteration within the loop as well.

Within the loop, every time `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum product found so far for subarrays ending at the current position, there should be a check to update `best_so_far` to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. However, the provided code does have this logic correctly implemented. The comment only reflects the final update outside the loop.

However, the more significant issue lies in the description of `best_so_far`'s initial state, which says "best_so_far is `xs[0]`" after the for-loop comment. This is incorrect since `best_so_far` was already updated inside the loop and possibly holds the value of `max_ending_here` for the maximum product found during the loop iteration rather than just `xs[0]`.

A correct description should mention the updated value held by `best_so_far` before returning it. Hereâ€™s a more precise state description right before the return statement:

```#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any subarray found throughout the list `xs`.```

But considering only the logic correctness, the implementation of `func_1` appears to follow the required algorithm correctly and thus the core logic of the function seems right based on the annotated state descriptions (ignoring minor issues in state descriptions). Since the task here is just asking about the correctness with regard to both program logic and the annotated descriptions, and given the presence of a discrepancy in the annotation about `best_so_far`'s final value description after the for-loop (which doesn't directly affect the logic correctness), the answer should still reflect overall correctness in functionality:

Thus, Correctness: **True**, under the assumption that we are primarily focusing on functional correctness rather than perfection in comments. However, strictly based on given instructions which involve checking correctness of states as mentioned in the annotated comments as well, it would be marked as False due to the inaccurate final state description. 

To resolve ambiguity, let's consider the more rigorous standard:

Correctness: **False**
