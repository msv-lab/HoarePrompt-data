Correctness: **False**

There is an issue with the final state mentioned in the comments within the program. The comment states:

```
#State: *`xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
```

This comment is somewhat misleading. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable should store the highest product found so far across the entire list, not just the last comparison. It needs to be updated every time a new maximum is found inside the loop. Here's the correct implementation along with appropriate comments:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf if xs is empty
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update the best product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray in `xs`.
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.
