Correctness: **False**

The annotated state comment after the loop contains an incorrect statement regarding `best_so_far`:

```python
#State: *`xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
```

The last part is incorrect because `best_so_far` can also be updated with a value of `max_ending_here` inside the loop when `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`.

Additionally, `best_so_far` should initially be updated with every new computed `max_ending_here` during each iteration in the loop to keep track of the maximum product seen so far.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```
In this revised function, `best_so_far` is updated in every iteration if the new `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`. This guarantees that `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist after the loop completes.
