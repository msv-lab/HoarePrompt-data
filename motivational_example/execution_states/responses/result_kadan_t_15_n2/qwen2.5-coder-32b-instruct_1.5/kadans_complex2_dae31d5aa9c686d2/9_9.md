Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given integer list.

The function `func_1` follows a dynamic programming approach, where `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element, and `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element. The variable `best_so_far` stores the maximum product encountered so far.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - If `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) as the product of an empty sublist is undefined and should not affect maximum calculations.
   - Otherwise, initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of `xs`.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element `num` in `xs` starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that even if `max_ending_here` became negative due to multiplying two negatives, it might still be the largest possible end product considering multiplication with the current number.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` to capture potential negative products.
   
3. **Final Update and Result**:
   - After iterating through all elements, if `max_ending_here` (the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element) is greater than `best_so_far` (which initially contains the first element of `xs` and is updated during iterations whenever we find a larger product), `best_so_far` is updated to this new maximum.
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which now holds the maximum product of any sublist found throughout the execution of the loop.

### Example Consideration:
- For an input like `[-2, 0, -1]`, the algorithm initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to `-2`. On iterating over `0`, both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` become `0` due to the presence of `0`. When encountering `-1`, `min_ending_here` becomes `-1` (since `-1` is smaller than both `0` and `-2*0`), while `max_ending_here` remains `0`. Since no other positive maximum was found, the final result will be `0`, which indeed is the maximum product of any sublist in the input.

### Conclusion:
The provided code handles the edge case of an empty list and correctly updates the `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` during iterations to account for changes in sign. It also maintains the correct `best_so_far` variable, ensuring the final returned value is accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
**Correctness: True**
