Correctness: **False**

The annotated program is mostly correct in its approach but has an issue that prevents it from correctly tracking and updating the `best_so_far` variable throughout the iteration over `xs`. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` at the end of the loop. However, the `best_so_far` should continuously track the maximum product found during the entire iteration process. 

Here's a corrected version of the function which ensures that `best_so_far` is continuously updated with the maximum value found at each step:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        # Consider the current number itself, the product with the previous max ending here, and the product with the previous min ending here (since multiplying a negative by a negative could yield a large positive)
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best so far if we found a larger product
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

This modification ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated after evaluating the products involving the current element in every iteration.
