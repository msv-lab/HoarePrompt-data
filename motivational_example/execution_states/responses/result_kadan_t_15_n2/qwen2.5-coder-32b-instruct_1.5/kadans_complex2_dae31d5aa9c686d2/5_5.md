To determine the correctness of the program, we need to carefully review each step and understand how it calculates the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers. The function `func_1` follows a common algorithm that handles positive and negative numbers effectively. It tracks the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list because a large negative number can become a large positive number when multiplied by another negative number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, it correctly returns `-inf` indicating there is no valid sublist to calculate a product.
   - Initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the temporary product `temp` of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product that could end at the current index `num`, considering previous products as well.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. It helps keep track of the lowest possible product to handle negative numbers correctly.

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After iterating through the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that the algorithm considers both increasing and decreasing sequences due to the presence of negative numbers. Thus, the function correctly handles the problem statement as given.

**Correctness: True**

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
