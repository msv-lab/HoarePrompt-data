Correctness: **False**

While the program attempts to find the maximum product of any sublist using dynamic programming principles, it has a logical error. Specifically, the program fails to update `best_so_far` at each step within the loop, so it might miss the maximum product that could be obtained before reaching the last element of the list.

Here's a corrected version of the code with the necessary updates:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
        # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of max_ending_here and num, and min_ending_here and num after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
    return best_so_far
```

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function ensures that the maximum product encountered is always recorded and can thus return the correct result for the input list.
