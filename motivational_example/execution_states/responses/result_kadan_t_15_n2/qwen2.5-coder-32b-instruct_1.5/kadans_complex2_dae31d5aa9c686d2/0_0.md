Correctness: **True**

Here's a step-by-step explanation to verify the correctness of the program:

### Key Steps and Explanation

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if the list `xs` is empty using `if (not xs):`.
   - If the list is empty, it returns `-inf` which correctly signifies that there is no product possible from an empty list.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - This makes sense because the initial maximum and minimum product ending at the first element is simply the first element itself.

3. **Iteration through the List**:
   - For each subsequent number `num` in the list `xs` (after the first), it calculates the potential maximum and minimum products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
   - `max_ending_here` is then updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. 
     - `num` is considered in case `max_ending_here` might become smaller than `num` when `num` is encountered directly.
     - `temp` is included as it represents the continuation of the previous subsequence.
     - `min_ending_here * num` can become larger if `min_ending_here` is negative, which flips its sign upon multiplication.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to track the smallest possible product ending at that point.

4. **Tracking Best Maximum Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each iteration, the program checks whether this new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. 
   - If it is, it updates `best_so_far`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far` which holds the highest product of any sub-list found during iterations.

### Final Thoughts

The above steps ensure that the program maintains a running account of the best possible products ending at each element and keeps track of the overall maximum product seen. It handles both positive and negative numbers correctly since multiplying two negatives produces a positive.

Thus, the logic is sound, and this approach will correctly yield the maximum product of any sublist of `xs`. Therefore, **Correctness: True**.
