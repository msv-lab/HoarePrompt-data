To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist, we need to analyze the program's logic step-by-step.

The function `func_1` is designed to handle the following:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` start as the first element of the list because the product of the smallest/largest sublist ending at the first element is the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized as the first element. This will keep track of the maximum product found so far across all iterations.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through each number in the list starting from the second one (since the first one was already processed).
   - In each iteration:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current element (`num`) and the previous maximum product (`max_ending_here`). 
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element (`num`), the product just computed (`temp`), and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`). This latter consideration is necessary because multiplying two negative numbers can yield a large positive number, thus `min_ending_here` plays a critical role.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly, but it keeps track of the minimum product up to the current position to cater to potential future multiplications that could result in a larger maximum product when combined with a negative number.
   
3. **Comparison and Update**:
   - After processing each element, the program checks whether `max_ending_here` (which holds the maximum product ending at the current index) is larger than the current `best_so_far`.
   - If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray using dynamic programming techniques in O(n) time complexity. It handles both positive and negative integers by considering minimum products that could become maximum if paired with another negative number.

**Conclusion**: The logic is sound and addresses all edge cases such as lists containing only one element, lists with alternating signs, and lists with all positive/negative elements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
