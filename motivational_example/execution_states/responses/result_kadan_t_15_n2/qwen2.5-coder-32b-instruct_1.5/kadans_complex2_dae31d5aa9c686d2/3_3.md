Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does update the `best_so_far` within the loop, but it never uses this value during iterations. As a result, it doesn't correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.

Here's a corrected version with the necessary update inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

This change ensures that at each step, the best possible product found so far (`best_so_far`) is updated to include the new maximum product ending at the current position.
