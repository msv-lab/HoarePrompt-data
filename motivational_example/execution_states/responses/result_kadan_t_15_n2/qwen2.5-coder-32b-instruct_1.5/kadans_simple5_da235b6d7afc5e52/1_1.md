Yes, the solution provided in the `func_1` function correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist (also known as contiguous subarray) in a given integer list. 

The function implements Kadane's algorithm with modifications to account for both maximum and minimum products up to the current position. This is necessary because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which could potentially lead to a larger product than previously recorded.

Here's a quick breakdown of the logic:
- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- It iterates through the rest of the list.
- For each element, it calculates a temporary maximum product (`temp`) assuming that the current maximum product can be extended by the current number.
- It updates `max_ending_here` by comparing the current number itself, the temporary maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product (because multiplying a negative minimum with another negative number can result in a new maximum).
- Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to track the smallest product, considering the possibility that a minimum product might become a new maximum when multiplied by another negative number.
- Finally, it updates `best_so_far` if the newly computed `max_ending_here` is greater than the previously stored `best_so_far`.
- Returns the `best_so_far` value, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the array.

This approach efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list.
