The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The function uses a dynamic programming approach, keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Let's analyze whether this function correctly solves the problem step-by-step.

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`. This indicates that there is no sublist to evaluate.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This tracks the minimum and maximum product that can be achieved ending at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, representing the best product found so far across all sublists.

3. **Iteration through List**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list (starting from the second one), the function recalculates the possible values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` holds the value of the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the new number. It's necessary because once `max_ending_here` is updated, it can no longer be used to compute `min_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three possible products: the current number itself, the product of the previous `max_ending_here` with the current number (`temp`), or the product of the previous `min_ending_here` with the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of these same three possible products.
   - This ensures that both potential extremes are tracked correctly.

4. **Updating Best Product**:
   - After processing each number, the function checks if `max_ending_here` (which now holds the best product ending at this index) is greater than `best_so_far`, and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Returning Result**:
   - Finally, `best_so_far`, which now contains the maximum product of any contiguous sublist, is returned.

**Conclusion**:
Yes, the solution as implemented in the function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given list of integers. It efficiently computes the result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list, using a constant amount of extra space.
