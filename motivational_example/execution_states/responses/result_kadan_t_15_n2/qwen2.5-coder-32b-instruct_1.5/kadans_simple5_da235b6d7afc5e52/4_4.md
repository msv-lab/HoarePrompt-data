The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist (contiguous subarray) in the given integer list. The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, considering that a negative number can turn a small (minimum) product into a large (maximum) one and vice versa.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - These variables help in tracking the maximum and minimum products up to the current element, as well as the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` holds the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that we account for both positive and negative products.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far` as the result, which represents the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution does correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The use of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` efficiently handles the case where a negative number can flip the sign and magnitude of the product, ensuring that all possible combinations are considered.
