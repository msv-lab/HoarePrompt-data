The provided Python solution does correctly address the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The algorithm efficiently computes the desired result using a dynamic programming approach with a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here`: This keeps track of the minimum product of the sublist ending at the current position.
  - `max_ending_here`: This keeps track of the maximum product of the sublist ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far`: This keeps track of the maximum product encountered so far.

- **Iterate through the List**:
  - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), calculate the new `temp` value as the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, the product calculated above (`temp`), and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`. This last product is considered because multiplying a negative number with a previously negative `min_ending_here` could potentially yield a positive number that is larger than `max_ending_here`.
  - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.

- **Update Best So Far**:
  - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that all possible contiguous sublists are considered without explicitly generating them, making it efficient in terms of both time and space.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The function returns `-inf` if the input list is empty, indicating that there is no valid sublist to consider.
- It correctly handles cases with negative numbers and zeroes, updating both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` appropriately based on these values.

In summary, the provided solution accurately and efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in an integer list.
