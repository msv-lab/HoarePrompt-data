Yes, the provided solution does solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist (also known as contiguous subarray) within a given list of integers.

Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables will track the minimum and maximum products of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to `xs[0]`. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all possible subarrays.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the rest of the elements in the list (from `xs[1:]` to the end).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates `temp` which is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This update considers three cases:
     - Starting a new subarray with the current number (`num`).
     - Continuing the previous subarray and multiplying by the current number (`temp`).
     - Continuing the previous subarray but considering the effect of multiplying by a negative number that would have previously resulted in the smallest product (`min_ending_here * num`).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we can correctly handle negative numbers, as multiplying by another negative number might turn a small negative product into a large positive one.
   
3. **Final Comparison**:
   - After processing each element, the code compares `max_ending_here` with `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is larger.

The approach efficiently computes the desired result in a single pass through the list (`O(n)` time complexity), which makes it optimal for this problem. The solution correctly handles edge cases like negative numbers, zeros, and mixed sign sequences. 

Thus, this implementation is correct for the problem statement provided.
