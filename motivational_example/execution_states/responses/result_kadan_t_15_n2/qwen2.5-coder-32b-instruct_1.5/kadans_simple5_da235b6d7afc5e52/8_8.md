The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's examine whether the function achieves this goal correctly.

### Analysis

The algorithm uses a variation of Kadane’s algorithm, typically used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. In this context, it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position, because multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product can yield a larger positive product.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: The smallest product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: The largest product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: The largest product found so far, initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration through the list**:
   - For each subsequent element (`num`), it calculates the potential new products considering multiplication with the previous `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here`, and the number itself.
   - `temp` holds the result of multiplying the current `max_ending_here` with `num`. 
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.
   - This handles both positive and negative numbers effectively, since multiplying two negatives yields a positive.

3. **Comparison and update**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` in each iteration, the function compares it to `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated.
   - This ensures that after the loop, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist.

4. **Edge case handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, it returns `-inf`, which seems a sensible response as there’s no valid sublist to consider.

### Verification of Correctness

The function handles:
- **Positive and negative numbers**
- **Single-element lists**
- **Lists starting or ending with negative numbers**
- **Multiple sublists having varying products**

### Conclusion

Based on this analysis, **the function does solve the problem correctly**. It efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given integer list. However, for readability and adherence to best practices, you might want to consider renaming variables (`min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, `best_so_far`) to more descriptive names, such as `min_product`, `max_product`, and `max_global`, respectively.

Here is the slightly modified version of your code with better variable naming:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_product = nums[0]
    max_product = nums[0]
    max_global = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        temp_max_product = max_product * num
        
        max_product = max(num, temp_max_product, min_product * num)
        min_product = min(num, temp_max_product, min_product * num)
        
        max_global = max(max_global, max_product)
    
    return max_global
```

This maintains the same logic while improving clarity.
