Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a small but critical flaw that affects its correctness in certain cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is not updated correctly within the loop. It should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist as it iterates through the list. The original code might miss the correct maximum product if it occurs later in the list.
