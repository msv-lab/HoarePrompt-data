Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the final check for updating `best_so_far`. The current implementation only checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` after the loop, but it should be updated inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always captured correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at each step is correctly captured. This ensures that the function returns the maximum product of any sublist correctly.
