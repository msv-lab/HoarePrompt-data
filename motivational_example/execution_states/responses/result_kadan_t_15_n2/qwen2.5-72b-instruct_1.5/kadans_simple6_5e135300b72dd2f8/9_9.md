Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is almost correct, but there's a minor issue in the logic where `best_so_far` is updated. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the highest value of `max_ending_here` as the loop progresses. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, the update can be simplified to:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Simplified update
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In the original code, `best_so_far` was only updated once after the loop, which could lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurred before the last element. The corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far.
