Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly handles the task of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with the current `max_ending_here`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This handles cases where a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that the smallest product is also tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input list is empty, the function returns negative infinity, which is a sensible default for the problem.

This approach ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist, even when the list contains negative numbers. Therefore, the solution is correct.
