Correctness: **False**

The given program is mostly correct, but there is a small issue that can cause incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable is only updated once at the end of the loop. This means that if the maximum product occurs at the beginning of the list, it might not be captured correctly.

To fix this, the `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop after each iteration, ensuring that the maximum product found so far is always tracked correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the missing update inside the loop.
