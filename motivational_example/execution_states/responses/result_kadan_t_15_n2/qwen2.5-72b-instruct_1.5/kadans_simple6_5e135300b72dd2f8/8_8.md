Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a minor flaw that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop after each iteration, rather than only at the end. This is because the maximum product might occur at any point during the traversal of the list, and not just at the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, even if it occurs in the middle of the list.
