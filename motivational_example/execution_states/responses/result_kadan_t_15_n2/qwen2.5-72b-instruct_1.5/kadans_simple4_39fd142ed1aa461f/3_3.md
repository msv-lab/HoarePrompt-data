The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the code step by step to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Empty List**:
  - The function correctly handles an empty list by returning `-inf`, which is appropriate since there is no valid product in an empty list.

- **Handling Negative Numbers**:
  - The use of `min_ending_here` ensures that the function can handle negative numbers correctly. This is crucial because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which could potentially be the maximum product.

- **Initialization**:
  - Initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list is correct.

- **Loop Logic**:
  - The logic inside the loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
  - The final check to update `best_so_far` ensures that the best product found so far is tracked correctly.

### Example Test Cases

Let's run a few test cases to verify the correctness:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([-1]))           # Expected output: -1 (sublist [-1])
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf (empty list)
```

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. The use of dynamic programming with `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the solution works even when the list contains negative numbers.
