The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue that could affect the final result. The problem is with the update of `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum value found so far. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
  
- **Loop**:
  - For each subsequent element in the list, we calculate the potential new maximum and minimum products ending at the current position.
  - `temp` is used to store the product of the current maximum product and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to ensure it tracks the minimum product (important for handling negative numbers).
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to keep track of the highest product found so far.

### Example:
For the input list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function should return `6` because the maximum product subarray is `[2, 3]`.

For the input list `[-2, 0, -1]`, the function should return `0` because the maximum product subarray is `[0]`.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated and reflects the maximum product of any subarray in the list.
