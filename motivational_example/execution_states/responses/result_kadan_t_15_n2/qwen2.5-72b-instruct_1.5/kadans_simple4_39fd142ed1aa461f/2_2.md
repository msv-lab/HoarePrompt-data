The provided solution has a logical issue that prevents it from correctly calculating the maximum product of any sublist for all possible cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at each step is compared with the best one found so far. The current implementation updates `best_so_far` only after the loop ends, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is encountered before the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
3. **Temporary Variable**: `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
4. **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These variables are updated based on the current number, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
5. **Update `best_so_far`**: This is done inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always up-to-date.

This corrected version will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist for the given input list.
