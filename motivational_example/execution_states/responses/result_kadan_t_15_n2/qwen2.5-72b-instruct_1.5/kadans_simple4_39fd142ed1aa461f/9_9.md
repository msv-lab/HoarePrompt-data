The solution provided is almost correct but contains a minor mistake in updating the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here before updating
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the product with max_ending_here, and the product with min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum value seen so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second one:
  - `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any subarray in the given list.
