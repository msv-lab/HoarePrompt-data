The provided solution is mostly correct but contains a minor logical error that could prevent it from always returning the correct maximum product of any sublist. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Problem Analysis
Given a list of integers, we need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist). The key challenge is handling negative numbers because multiplying two negative numbers can yield a positive product, which might become the new maximum.

### Provided Solution
The solution uses a dynamic programming approach where it keeps track of both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn the smallest product into the largest product and vice versa.

### Issues in the Provided Solution
1. **Update of `best_so_far`**:
   - The update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far at each step.
   - Currently, the update of `best_so_far` is outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here`.

### Corrected Solution
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Simplified Update of `best_so_far`
Alternatively, you can simplify the update of `best_so_far` using a `max` function inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each element, compute the temporary product `temp` and update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: Ensure `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` at each step.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
