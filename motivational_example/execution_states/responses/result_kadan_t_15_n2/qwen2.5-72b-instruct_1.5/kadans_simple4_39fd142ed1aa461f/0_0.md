The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic implemented in the code is generally correct, but there's a small oversight that needs correction. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop, not just at the end, to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far as the algorithm progresses through the list.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element `num` starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist, even when the list contains negative numbers or zeros.
