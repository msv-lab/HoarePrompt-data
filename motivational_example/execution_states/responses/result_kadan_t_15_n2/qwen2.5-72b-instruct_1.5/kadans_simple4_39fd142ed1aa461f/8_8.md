The provided solution is almost correct, but there is a small issue in the logic that could lead to incorrect results. The main problem is in the update of `best_so_far`. The `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures we keep track of the smallest possible product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist, which is returned.

This corrected version ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.
