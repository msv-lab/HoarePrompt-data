The provided Python program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the logic used to update `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the highest value of `max_ending_here` throughout the iteration, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum value, ensuring that we keep track of the smallest possible product.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

This ensures that `best_so_far` correctly captures the maximum product of any subarray as the function iterates through the list.
