Correctness: **False**

The program provided is almost correct but has a couple of issues that prevent it from working as intended:

1. The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop, not outside. As currently written, the program only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` and ignores all the previous potential maximum values.

2. The comment after the loop incorrectly states that `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, and other details. This is misleading because these variables are overwritten in each iteration of the loop, and their final state does not necessarily correspond to the last element of `xs`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
        # State: xs remains the same, num is the current element being processed, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element, best_so_far is the maximum product found so far.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, min_ending_here is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of xs, max_ending_here is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of xs, and best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist of xs.
    return best_so_far
```

With these corrections, the function will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.
