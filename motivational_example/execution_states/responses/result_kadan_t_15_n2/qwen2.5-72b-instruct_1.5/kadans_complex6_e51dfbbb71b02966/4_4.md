Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error that could prevent it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist. The issue lies in the placement of the final check for updating `best_so_far` outside the loop. This check should be performed inside the loop after each iteration to ensure that the `best_so_far` is updated appropriately as the algorithm progresses through the list.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values considering the current element and the products with the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. It should be updated within the loop to ensure that the best value is captured at each step.

This corrected version will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
