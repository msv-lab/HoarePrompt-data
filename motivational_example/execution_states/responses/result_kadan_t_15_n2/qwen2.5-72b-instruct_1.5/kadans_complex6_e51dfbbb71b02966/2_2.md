Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that prevents it from correctly updating the `best_so_far` variable throughout the loop. The `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always stored. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In the original code, `best_so_far` was only updated once outside the loop, which could lead to incorrect results if the maximum product was found earlier in the list. By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
