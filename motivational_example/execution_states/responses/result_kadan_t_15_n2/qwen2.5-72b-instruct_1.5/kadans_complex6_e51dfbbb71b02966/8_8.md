Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list `xs`. This handles the base case for the first element in the list.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` to indicate that no valid product can be found.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: The function iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element `num`, it calculates:
   - `temp`: The product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `max_ending_here`: The maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here`: The minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Updating the Best Result**: The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. It is updated at each step if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Final Return**: After the loop, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

The program logic and state comments are consistent and accurately describe the steps and state of the variables throughout the execution. Therefore, the solution is correct.
