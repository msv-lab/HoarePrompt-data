Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This keeps track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, which is crucial because a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative product and vice versa.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that the current element might be part of a new subsequence or extend the previous one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product in case it becomes useful later (e.g., when multiplied by a negative number).

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly. However, this check is actually redundant because `best_so_far` is already updated inside the loop. The final value of `best_so_far` will be the maximum product of any sublist.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

The annotations provided in the comments are also consistent with the logic of the program. Therefore, the solution is correct.
