Correctness: **False**

The provided program is almost correct, but there's a subtle issue in the logic that prevents it from working correctly in all cases. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done within the loop, not after the loop ends. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` **within the loop**.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the best possible product is always captured, even if the maximum product occurs at any point during the iteration.
