Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor logical flaw that affects the final result. The issue lies in the placement of the update statement for `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, the update is placed outside the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far` once, after the loop has completed. However, to ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, the update should be performed inside the loop after each iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Check**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through the rest of the elements in the list, updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current element and the products of the previous sublists.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: The critical part is moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always captured.

With this correction, the function will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
