Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is almost correct but has a small flaw in the final part of the function where it checks and updates `best_so_far`. The issue lies in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. According to the logic of the algorithm, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop each time a new maximum product is found, not just at the end of the function. This ensures that the maximum product found during the entire iteration is captured, even if it doesn't occur at the very end of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at each step is considered for the final result. This correction addresses the issue and makes the solution correct.
