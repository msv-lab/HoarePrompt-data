### Explanation:

The program aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity represents the absence of any valid product.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to `xs[0]`, which keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.

4. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the edge case of an empty list.
- The dynamic programming approach using `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that both positive and negative sublists are considered, which is crucial for finding the maximum product.
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is sound and ensures that the algorithm can handle sequences with negative numbers and zero values.
- The final check and update of `best_so_far` ensure that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as intended for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

Correctness: **True**
