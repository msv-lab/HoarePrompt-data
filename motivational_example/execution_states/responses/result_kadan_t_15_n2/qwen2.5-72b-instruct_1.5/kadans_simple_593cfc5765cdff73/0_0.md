### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers. The provided function `func_1` aims to solve this problem using dynamic programming principles.

#### Key Points in the Function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the maximum product ending at the current position is correctly updated.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the minimum product ending at the current position is correctly updated, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered as undefined (negative infinity).

#### Potential Issues:
- **Final Update to `best_so_far`**:
  - The final update to `best_so_far` is inside the loop, which means it only updates during the last iteration. However, the maximum product could be found earlier in the list. To ensure `best_so_far` captures the true maximum, the update should be inside the loop but outside the conditional check.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. The corrected version ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.

**Correctness: False** (due to the placement of the update to `best_so_far` inside the conditional check).
