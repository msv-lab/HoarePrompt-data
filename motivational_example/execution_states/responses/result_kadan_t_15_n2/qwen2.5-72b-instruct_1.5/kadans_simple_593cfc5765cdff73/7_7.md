Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Program Analysis

#### Function Definition
```python
def func_1(xs):
```
- The function takes a list of integers `xs` as input.

#### Initial Checks
```python
if not xs:
    return float('-inf')
```
- If the list is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that any non-empty sublist will have a higher product.

#### Initialization
```python
min_ending_here = xs[0]
max_ending_here = xs[0]
best_so_far = xs[0]
```
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

#### Loop Through the List
```python
for num in xs[1:]:
    temp = max_ending_here * num
    max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
```
- For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
    - The current number `num`.
    - The product of the current maximum product and the current number (`temp`).
    - The product of the current minimum product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
    - The current number `num`.
    - The product of the current maximum product and the current number (`temp`).
    - The product of the current minimum product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

#### Final Check
```python
if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
```
- After the loop, `max_ending_here` might be the maximum product of the last considered sublist. If it is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

#### Return the Result
```python
return best_so_far
```
- The function returns the maximum product found.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It considers both positive and negative numbers and updates the maximum and minimum products appropriately to handle cases where the product can become large or small due to the presence of negative numbers.

**Correctness: True**
