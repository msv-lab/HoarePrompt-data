Let's break down the solution to see if it correctly addresses the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subsequence (sublist) within the given list `xs`.

### Key Points in the Solution
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is because at the start, the maximum and minimum products ending at the first element are both the first element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (`xs[1:]`) and iterates through the list.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element (`max_ending_here * num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current element `num`.
       - The product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous element (`min_ending_here * num`). This is important because if `num` is negative, multiplying it with the smallest (most negative) product can result in a large positive product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the same three values. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product ending at the current position, which can be useful for future negative multiplications.
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the function returns `-inf` to indicate that no valid subsequence exists, which is a reasonable choice for this context.

### Analysis
- The algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
- The use of `temp` ensures that the calculations are done in the correct order, avoiding potential issues with the order of operations.
- The final check to update `best_so_far` with `max_ending_here` is necessary because the maximum product might be updated in the last iteration.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
