Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a valid base case because an empty list has no sublists, and thus no product can be computed.
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`. These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - It calculates the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is necessary to handle negative numbers correctly.

3. **Updating the Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the base case of an empty list.
- It maintains the correct values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step, ensuring that it can handle negative numbers and zero appropriately.
- The final result `best_so_far` is updated correctly to reflect the maximum product of any sublist encountered.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

Correctness: **True**
