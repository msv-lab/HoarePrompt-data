Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is because the maximum and minimum products up to the first element are both the first element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This will keep track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list:
     - Calculate `temp`, which is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`. This represents the potential new maximum product if we continue the current subsequence.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element `num` (starting a new subsequence).
       - The product `temp` (continuing the current subsequence).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num` (considering negative values that can turn a minimum into a maximum).
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current element `num`.
       - The product `temp`.
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Sublist Consideration**: The algorithm considers all possible sublists by dynamically updating the maximum and minimum products at each step.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist. It handles edge cases and ensures that both positive and negative numbers are considered appropriately.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
