Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Problem Description:
- Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - This initialization ensures that we start with the first element and update these variables as we iterate through the list.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The program iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number itself might be greater than the product of previous sublists, and it also considers the effect of negative numbers which can flip the sign of the product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This helps in tracking the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge Case:**
   - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity) to indicate that there is no valid product.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the edge case of an empty list.
- The dynamic programming approach used in the program efficiently tracks the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which is essential for correctly handling negative numbers and zero values.
- The logic ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is captured and updated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and effectively solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

**Correctness: True**
