Let's break down the provided solution and evaluate its correctness step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. A sublist is any contiguous segment of the list.

### Solution Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity, as there is no valid product.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`):
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

### Analysis:
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles an empty list by returning negative infinity.
  - It also initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list, which is necessary for the dynamic programming approach.

- **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
  - The use of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is crucial because the product of two negative numbers is positive, and it could potentially lead to a larger product later in the list.
  - The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, and the best possible product is tracked.

- **Update Condition**:
  - The condition `if max_ending_here > best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product is updated after processing each element. However, in the provided code, this update is outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`. This is incorrect.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, the update condition should be inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is almost correct but has a small issue with the placement of the update condition for `best_so_far`. With the correction mentioned above, the program will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.

Correctness: **False** (due to the misplaced update condition, but easily fixable).
