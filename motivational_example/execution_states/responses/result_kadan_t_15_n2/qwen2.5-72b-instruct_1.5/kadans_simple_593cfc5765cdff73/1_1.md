### Reasoning

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly handles all necessary cases.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position, considering both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers and ensuring the correct maximum product is found.

3. **Updating the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Analysis of Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` if the list is empty, which is appropriate since the product of an empty sublist is undefined.
- **Single Element**: The function correctly handles a single-element list by returning that element itself.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products, which allows it to account for the possibility of a large positive product resulting from two negative numbers.
- **Zeroes**: The function correctly handles zeroes by resetting the product calculations when encountering a zero, ensuring that the maximum product is not incorrectly influenced by a zero.

### Conclusion

Based on the reasoning and analysis of edge cases, the provided program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
