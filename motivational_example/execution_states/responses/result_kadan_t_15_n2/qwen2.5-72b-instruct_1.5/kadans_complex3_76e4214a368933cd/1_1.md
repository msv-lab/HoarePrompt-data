Correctness: **False**

The program logic is mostly correct, but there is a critical flaw in the loop where the `best_so_far` variable is not being updated correctly within the loop. The update should be done inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in `xs`:
  - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - **Update `best_so_far`** to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far. This is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm.
