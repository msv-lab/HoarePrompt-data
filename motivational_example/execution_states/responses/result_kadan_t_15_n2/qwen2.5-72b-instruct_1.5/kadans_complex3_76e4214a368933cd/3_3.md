Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code has a logical flaw that affects the final result when calculating the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`. The flaw is in the placement of the update statement for `best_so_far` outside the loop, which means it only updates `best_so_far` with the final value of `max_ending_here` after the loop completes. This can lead to incorrect results because the maximum product might occur before the last element.

To fix this, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop so that it checks and updates the best maximum product found so far at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
