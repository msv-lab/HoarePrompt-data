Correctness: **False**

The solution provided is mostly correct but contains a small logical error that prevents it from functioning optimally. The issue lies in the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, the `best_so_far` variable is only checked and updated once after the loop has completed, instead of being continuously updated during each iteration of the loop. This can lead to incorrect results because the best possible product might be found and then lost before the loop completes.

To fix this, the update to `best_so_far` should be moved inside the loop, so it captures the best possible product at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist as it iterates through the list, ensuring that the final result is accurate.
