Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a minor logical flaw that can cause it to return incorrect results. The issue lies in the placement of the update to `best_so_far` within the loop structure. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated inside the loop after each iteration to ensure that the maximum product found so far is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop after each iteration, ensuring that the maximum product found so far is correctly tracked. This change ensures that the function will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
