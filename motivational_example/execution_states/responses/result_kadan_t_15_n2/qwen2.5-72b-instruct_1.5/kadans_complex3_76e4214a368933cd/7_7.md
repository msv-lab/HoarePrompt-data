Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the placement of the final comparison between `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far`. The comparison and potential update of `best_so_far` should occur inside the loop for each element, not just once after the loop ends. This is because the best product might be found before the last element, and the current implementation only checks the last value of `max_ending_here`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` check is moved inside the loop, ensuring that `best_so_far` is updated for every element in the list, not just the last one. This ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly identified.
