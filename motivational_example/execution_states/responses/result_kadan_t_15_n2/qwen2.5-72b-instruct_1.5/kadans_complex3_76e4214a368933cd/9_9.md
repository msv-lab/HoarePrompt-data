Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function is almost correct but has a logical flaw in its loop structure. The issue lies in how `best_so_far` is updated. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop ends, based on the final value of `max_ending_here`. However, this approach misses potential updates to `best_so_far` that could occur during the loop iterations.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.
2. **Loop Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list:
   - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - **Update `best_so_far` inside the loop**: This ensures that the best possible product is captured at each step, not just at the end.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, return `best_so_far`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly captures the maximum product of any sublist, even if it occurs before the last element of the list.
