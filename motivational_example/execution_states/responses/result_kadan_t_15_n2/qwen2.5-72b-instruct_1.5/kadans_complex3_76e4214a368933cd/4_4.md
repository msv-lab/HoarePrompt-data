Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided solution lies in the update of the `best_so_far` variable. In the current implementation, the `best_so_far` variable is only updated once after the loop has completed. However, to ensure that the algorithm finds the maximum product of any sublist, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop each time `max_ending_here` is computed. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far, and the function returns the correct result.
