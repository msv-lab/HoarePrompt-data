Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update should be done within the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` captures the maximum product of any sublist seen so far, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Invariant**: Inside the loop, `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position, and `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product (to handle negative numbers correctly). `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The update `best_so_far = max_ending_here` should be inside the loop to ensure that it is always the maximum product found up to the current position.

With this correction, the program will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.
