Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw that could lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in how the `best_so_far` variable is updated. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only checked and potentially updated at the end of the loop, but it should be updated within the loop for each iteration to ensure that the best product found so far is always captured.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
# Problem:
# Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and max_ending_here, and the product of the current number and min_ending_here.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and max_ending_here, and the product of the current number and min_ending_here.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of the current best_so_far and max_ending_here.
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of the current `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated to the best possible product found so far, making the solution correct.
