Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided is almost correct but has a critical flaw in how it updates `best_so_far`. The issue lies in the placement of the condition that updates `best_so_far`. The condition to update `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is updated after each iteration. However, in the provided code, the update to `best_so_far` is placed outside the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far` once, after the loop has completed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, `best_so_far` will be updated at each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly tracked throughout the entire list. This is crucial for handling cases where the maximum product can change within the loop, especially when negative numbers are involved.
