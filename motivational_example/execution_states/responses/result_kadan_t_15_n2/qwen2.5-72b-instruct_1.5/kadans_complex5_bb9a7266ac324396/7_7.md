The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's analyze the function to see if it meets the requirements and is implemented correctly.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` to indicate that there is no valid product. This is correct because an empty list does not contain any sublists.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element sublist are the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because initially, the best product found so far is the first element.

3. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `temp`: the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here`: the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here`: the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After the loop, the function updates `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

### State Analysis

- **Initial State**:
  - `xs` is a list of integers.
  - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.

- **Loop Invariant**:
  - After each iteration, `max_ending_here` holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.

- **Final State**:
  - `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to verify the correctness:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]

# Initial state
min_ending_here = 2
max_ending_here = 2
best_so_far = 2

# First iteration: num = 3
temp = 2 * 3 = 6
max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6
min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3
best_so_far = 6

# Second iteration: num = -2
temp = 6 * (-2) = -12
max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2
min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12
best_so_far = 6

# Third iteration: num = 4
temp = -2 * 4 = -8
max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4
min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48
best_so_far = 6

# Final state
best_so_far = 6
```

The function correctly returns `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct. It correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, and it efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list. The comments accurately describe the state of the variables at each step, and the logic is sound.
