The provided solution aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. The approach used in the function `func_1` is a dynamic programming technique that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

However, there is a logical error in the placement of the final update to `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop, so that `best_so_far` is continuously updated with the highest `max_ending_here` found during the iteration through the list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here, inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Inside the Loop**: The update to `best_so_far` should occur within the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` captures the highest `max_ending_here` at each step.
- **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of the list, which is correct.

### Final State:
- **After the Loop**: `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
