The solution provided is generally correct, but there's a critical error in the placement of the final check to update `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop, not outside. This is because the maximum product might change with each element, and you want to ensure that you're always keeping track of the best maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop:** The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` and the subsequent update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop. This ensures that the maximum product is checked and updated after each element is processed.

### Final State Comments:
- **After Each Iteration:**
  - `xs` remains the same.
  - `num` is the current element being processed.
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

- **After the Loop:**
  - `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This corrected function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
