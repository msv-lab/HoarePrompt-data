The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers, `xs`. Let's break down the code to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

### Code Analysis

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, indicating that there are no products to consider in an empty list.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`. It keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values. This is crucial because a negative number multiplied by a negative number can become positive and potentially become the new maximum.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`. This ensures that the final maximum product is considered.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Correctness Verification

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Empty list: Correctly returns `-inf`.
  - List with all positive numbers: Correctly finds the maximum product.
  - List with all negative numbers: Correctly finds the maximum product.
  - List with both positive and negative numbers: Correctly handles the transition between positive and negative products.

- **Logical Flow**:
  - The algorithm correctly updates the maximum and minimum products at each step, considering the possibility of negative numbers changing the sign of the product.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct. It efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. The logic and state transitions are correctly implemented, ensuring that the function works for various edge cases and input scenarios.
