The solution provided is mostly correct but contains a small logical oversight that could affect the correctness of the final result. Let's break down the solution and identify the issue:

### Explanation of the Code

The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the given list of integers `xs`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `xs` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

### Issue with the Solution

The issue lies in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list, not just after the loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Inside the Loop**: By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product found at each step is considered.
- **Correct Final Result**: This ensures that the function correctly returns the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the corrected function with a few test cases:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (Sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (Sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Output: 12 (Sublist [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -5, 1]))  # Output: 2 (Sublist [2])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -9, -6]))  # Output: 108 (Sublist [-9, -6])
```

These test cases should confirm that the corrected function works as expected.
