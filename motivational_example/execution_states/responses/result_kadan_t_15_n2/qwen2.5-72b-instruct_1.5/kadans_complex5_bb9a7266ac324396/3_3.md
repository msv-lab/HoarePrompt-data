The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers `xs`. Let's analyze the function step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate since there are no elements to form a product.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iteration**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this check ensures that `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum value found during the iteration.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns the best (maximum) product found.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set appropriately to the first element of the list.
- **Iteration Logic**:
  - The use of `temp` to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` is necessary to avoid using the already updated value of `max_ending_here` in the same iteration.
  - The update of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considers all possible products (current number, product with `max_ending_here`, and product with `min_ending_here`) to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively.
- **Final Update**: The final update ensures that `best_so_far` captures the maximum product found during the entire iteration.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist from the given list of integers. The logic and state transitions are well-handled, and the function should work correctly for various inputs, including lists with both positive and negative integers.
