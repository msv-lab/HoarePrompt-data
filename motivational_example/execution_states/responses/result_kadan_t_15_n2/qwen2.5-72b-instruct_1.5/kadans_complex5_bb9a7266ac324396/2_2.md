The solution provided for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers is almost correct, but there is a critical mistake in the placement of the final comparison and update of `best_so_far`. The logic for updating `best_so_far` should be inside the loop where `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are being calculated, not outside it. This is because `best_so_far` needs to be updated at each step to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Inside the Loop**: The check `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` and the subsequent update `best_so_far = max_ending_here` should occur within the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at every step to reflect the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
- **Final Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist, and this value is returned.

### Example:
For the input `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function will correctly return `6` (the product of the sublist `[2, 3]`).

For the input `xs = [-2, 0, -1]`, the function will correctly return `0` (since the maximum product is `0` when considering sublists).

This correction ensures that the algorithm works correctly for all cases.
