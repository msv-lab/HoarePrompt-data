The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list `xs`. The approach used is based on dynamic programming principles where it keeps track of the maximum and minimum products at each step because a negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum when multiplied by another negative number.

Here's a detailed review of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If so, it returns `-inf`, representing that there is no valid subarray to compute the product.
   - It initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far, initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element `num`.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current element `num`. This accounts for the possibility of a negative `num` turning a negative product positive.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current element `num`. This ensures that the minimum product is tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary. However, this update should be done inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for every element in the list, not just the last one.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any subarray found during the iteration.

### Correctness:
The logic of the function is generally correct, but there is a minor issue in the update of `best_so_far`. It should be updated inside the loop to reflect the best product found so far after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Update Inside Loop**: Moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop ensures that the best product is captured at each step, not just at the end.

This revised function should correctly compute the maximum product of any subarray within the input list `xs`.
