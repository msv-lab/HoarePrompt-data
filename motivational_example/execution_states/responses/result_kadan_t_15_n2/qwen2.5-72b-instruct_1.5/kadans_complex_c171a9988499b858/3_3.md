Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but there's a logical issue that affects its correctness. The final state comment suggests that `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to reflect the highest maximum product found so far. However, the current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against the initial value of `best_so_far` (which is the first element of the list). This can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is not found at the end of the list.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program with the necessary update inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which now correctly holds the maximum product of any subarray in the list.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always reflects the highest maximum product found so far, leading to the correct result.
