**Correctness: False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop, but it should be updated inside the loop to capture the maximum product at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code updates `best_so_far` only once after the loop, which means it might miss the highest value if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product found so far is always captured.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the input `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`.

- **Original Code**: 
  - After processing `[2, 3]`, `max_ending_here` is `6` and `best_so_far` is `6`.
  - After processing `[-2, 4]`, `max_ending_here` becomes `-8` and `min_ending_here` becomes `-12`.
  - At the end, `best_so_far` is still `6`, which is incorrect because the maximum product subarray is `[4]` with a product of `4`.

- **Corrected Code**:
  - After processing `[2, 3]`, `max_ending_here` is `6` and `best_so_far` is `6`.
  - After processing `[-2]`, `max_ending_here` becomes `-12` and `min_ending_here` becomes `-12`.
  - After processing `[4]`, `max_ending_here` becomes `4` and `best_so_far` is updated to `6` (which is incorrect, but it will be correctly updated to `6` in the next step).
  - Finally, `best_so_far` is correctly set to `6` after processing all elements.

Thus, the corrected version of the function ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly computed.
