Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical issue that prevents it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist in all cases. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the highest value as the loop progresses through the list. Currently, it only updates `best_so_far` after the loop has finished, which means it might miss the true maximum product if it occurs before the last iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far, even if the maximum product is achieved before the last element of the list.
