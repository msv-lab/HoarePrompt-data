Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to find the maximum product of any sublist from the given list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function starts by checking if the list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is the correct response because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered undefined or the lowest possible value.
   - If the list is not empty, the initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list. This initialization is correct because the first element itself is a valid subarray.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current element itself could be larger, or the product with the previous maximum or minimum could be larger.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is necessary because the minimum product could also become the maximum if the next element is negative.
   - The variable `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` at each step, ensuring that it always holds the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Final Return**:
   - After iterating through the list, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any subarray.

The comments accurately describe the state of the variables at each step, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
