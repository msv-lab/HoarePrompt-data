Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is almost correct but has one critical issue in the loop. The update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the best possible product after each iteration. As written, the update of `best_so_far` only happens once after the loop has completed, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray of `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product found so far is always stored correctly. This way, if the maximum product is found before the last element, it will still be captured and returned.

This correction ensures that the function works correctly for all input cases.
