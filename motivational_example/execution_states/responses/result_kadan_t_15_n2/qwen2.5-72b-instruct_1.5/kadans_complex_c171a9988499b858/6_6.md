Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program is mostly correct but has a small issue with the final state update logic. The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is correctly tracked. Currently, it is only updated once after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found in the middle of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Corrected States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **After Checking Empty List**: If `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`.
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
- **Final State**: `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any subarray in `xs`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.
