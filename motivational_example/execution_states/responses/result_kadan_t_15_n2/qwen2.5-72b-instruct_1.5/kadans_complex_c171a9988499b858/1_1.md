**Correctness: False**

Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Currently, the update is placed outside the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` after the loop has completed, potentially missing out on a higher value that might have been encountered during the iterations.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` check is moved inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated correctly throughout the iterations. This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
