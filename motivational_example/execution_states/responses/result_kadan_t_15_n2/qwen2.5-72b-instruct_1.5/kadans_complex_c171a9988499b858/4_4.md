Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided is almost correct but has a small flaw in the loop structure that affects its ability to update `best_so_far` correctly for all sublists. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, not outside. This is because the maximum product could be found at any point during the iteration, not just at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product of any sublist as soon as it is found. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
