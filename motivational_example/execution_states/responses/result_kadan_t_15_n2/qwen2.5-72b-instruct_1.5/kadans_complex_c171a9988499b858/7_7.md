Correctness: **False**

The provided program is almost correct, but there's a small mistake in the state management inside the loop. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the highest product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the best (maximum) product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **State Management**: The variable `best_so_far` should be updated every time a new potential maximum product is found. This is done by comparing `best_so_far` with `max_ending_here` after each iteration of the loop.
- **Loop Invariant**: After each iteration, `max_ending_here` holds the maximum product of any subarray ending at the current element, and `min_ending_here` holds the minimum product (which is important for handling negative numbers).
- **Final Return**: The final value of `best_so_far` will be the maximum product of any subarray in the list.

By making this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any subarray in the list `xs`.
