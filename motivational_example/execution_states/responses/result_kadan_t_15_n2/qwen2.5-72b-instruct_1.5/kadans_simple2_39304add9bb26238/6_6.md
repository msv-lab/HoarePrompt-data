Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview
The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is correct because there are no elements to form a product, and returning `-inf` indicates that no valid product exists.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the overall maximum product found.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product. This handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new value is greater than the current `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

### Conclusion
The function correctly handles all edge cases and updates the maximum product efficiently. It accounts for both positive and negative numbers and ensures that the maximum product is tracked correctly throughout the list.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
