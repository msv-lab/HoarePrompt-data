Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate since the product of an empty sublist is undefined (and no valid product can be less than negative infinity).

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively. `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product, which is useful for handling negative numbers.

4. **Updating the Best Product:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, this line checks if it is greater than the current best product found so far and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the best product found.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist. It handles edge cases such as empty lists and considers the impact of negative numbers on the product. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
