Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview:
The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

### Key Variables:
- `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

### Initial Conditions:
- If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).
- The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.

### Loop Through the List:
- For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
  - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
    - The current element `num`.
    - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (i.e., `temp`).
    - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.
  - `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Final Return:
- The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The initial conditions handle the case where the list is empty and set the initial values correctly.
2. **Loop**: The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products. This is crucial because a negative number multiplied by another negative number can become positive and potentially yield a higher product.
3. **Update `best_so_far`**: The update of `best_so_far` ensures that the overall maximum product is tracked throughout the iteration.
4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as lists with all negative numbers or lists with zeros correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct. It properly handles the computation of the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

Correctness: **True**
