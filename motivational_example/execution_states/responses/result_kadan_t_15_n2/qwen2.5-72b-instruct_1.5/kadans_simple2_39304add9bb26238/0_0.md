To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step:

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer list, find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because there are no elements to form a product, and returning `-inf` ensures that any valid product will be greater.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list `xs[1:]`.
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we track the minimum product, which is useful when dealing with negative numbers.
     - `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Verification:
- The initialization and edge case handling are correct.
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is correct and handles both positive and negative numbers effectively.
- The final return value `best_so_far` correctly represents the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
