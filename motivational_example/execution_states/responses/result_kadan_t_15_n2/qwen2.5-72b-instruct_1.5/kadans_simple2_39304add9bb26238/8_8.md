Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Function Breakdown:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity, which is a reasonable value since the product of an empty sublist does not exist.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each subsequent number in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current number itself (`num`).
       - The product of the current maximum product and the current number (`temp`).
       - The product of the current minimum product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values:
       - The current number itself (`num`).
       - The product of the current maximum product and the current number (`temp`).
       - The product of the current minimum product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than the current best product found so far (`best_so_far`). If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty.
- It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the list, updating the maximum and minimum products dynamically.
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considers all possible cases (positive and negative numbers) and ensures that the maximum product is tracked correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

Correctness: **True**
