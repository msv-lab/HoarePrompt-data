Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is appropriate because an empty list cannot have any sublists with a product.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are both set to the first element of the list `xs`.
     - `best_so_far` is also set to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively.

3. **Iteration Over the List:**
   - The function iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - The purpose of these updates is to account for the possibility that the current element `num` can either extend the previous subarray or start a new subarray.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling Negative Numbers:**
  - The function correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

- **Handling Zeroes:**
  - The function does not explicitly handle zeroes, but it will work correctly because multiplying by zero will reset the product to zero, and the function will consider the next subarray starting from the next non-zero element.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty by returning negative infinity.
  - It also handles the case where the list has only one element by returning that element.

### Conclusion:

The given function `func_1` is correct and will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

**Correctness: True**
