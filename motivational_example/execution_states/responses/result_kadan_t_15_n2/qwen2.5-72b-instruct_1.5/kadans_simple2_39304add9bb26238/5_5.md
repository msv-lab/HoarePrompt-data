Let's analyze the given Python function step-by-step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is correct because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that this case is handled gracefully.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each subsequent number in the list, the function calculates the product of the current number with the previous maximum product (`temp`).
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product `temp`, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product `temp`, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product.
   - This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After each iteration, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

The given Python function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles edge cases (empty list), and the dynamic programming approach using `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that it considers both positive and negative numbers effectively.

**Correctness: True**
