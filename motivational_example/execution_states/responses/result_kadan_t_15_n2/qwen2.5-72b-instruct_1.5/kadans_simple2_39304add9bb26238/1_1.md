Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Purpose
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the given list `xs`.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is a reasonable approach because the product of an empty subarray can be considered undefined or infinitely small.

   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized with the first element of the list:
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current element `num` (considering the subarray consisting of just the current element).
       - The product of the current element and the previous maximum product (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`). This is important because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which could be a new maximum.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to track the minimum product, considering the same three values.

3. **Updating the Best Result:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After each iteration, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than the `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any subarray found during the iterations.

### Conclusion
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in the list `xs`. The steps taken ensure that both positive and negative products are considered, and the use of `min_ending_here` helps handle cases where the product of two negative numbers becomes positive.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
