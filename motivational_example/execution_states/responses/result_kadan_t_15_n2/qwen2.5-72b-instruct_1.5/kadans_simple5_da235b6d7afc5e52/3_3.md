The provided solution is almost correct but has a small oversight that could lead to incorrect results for certain cases. Let's break it down and identify the issue.

### Explanation of the Code

The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the given list `xs`. The approach used is dynamic programming, where we keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The variable `best_so_far` is updated only once at the end of the loop. However, the maximum product could occur at any point during the iteration, so `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop.

### Corrected Solution

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Inside the Loop**: The `best_so_far` variable is updated inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product as soon as it is found.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is correct.

### Example Usage

Let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(max_product_sublist([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(max_product_sublist([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0
print(max_product_sublist([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output: 24
```

### Explanation of Test Cases

1. `[2, 3, -2, 4]`: The maximum product is `6` (from the subarray `[2, 3]`).
2. `[-2, 0, -1]`: The maximum product is `0` (since zero is present and no positive product can be greater than zero).
3. `[-2, 3, -4]`: The maximum product is `24` (from the subarray `[-2, 3, -4]`).

This corrected solution should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
