The provided solution does address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. However, there is a small issue in the implementation that needs to be corrected for it to work as intended. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop after each iteration to ensure it captures the highest value encountered so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary maximum and minimum values
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        # Update best_so_far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. This handles the case where the list has only one element.
   
2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, we calculate the temporary maximum and minimum products ending at the current position.
   - `temp_max` is the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp_min` is the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are then updated to these temporary values.
   - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum value between itself and `max_ending_here`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and accounts for sublists that might start or end at any point in the list.

### Example Usage:
```python
print(max_product_sublist([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(max_product_sublist([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(max_product_sublist([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
```

This corrected version should now accurately find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
