The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the function to ensure it correctly addresses the problem:

### Breakdown of the Function

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This handles the edge case where the list has no elements.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable will store the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list (starting from the second element), the function updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
   - The temporary variable `temp` stores the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number multiplied by the current minimum could result in a larger positive product.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values. This ensures that the function can handle cases where the current element or its product with previous values results in a smaller value.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis

- **Correctness**: The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and their products. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, ensuring that it can handle cases where the maximum product might involve a negative number.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- **Efficiency**: The function iterates through the list once, making it O(n) in time complexity, which is efficient for this problem.

### Conclusion

The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the maximum product is accurately computed. Therefore, the solution is correct and effective.
