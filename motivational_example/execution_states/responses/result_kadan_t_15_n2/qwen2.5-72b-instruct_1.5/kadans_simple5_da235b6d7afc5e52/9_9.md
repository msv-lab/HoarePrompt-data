The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) from a given list of integers (`xs`). Let's analyze whether this solution correctly addresses the problem.

### Problem Recap
- **Objective:** Find the maximum product of any sublist.
- **Input:** A list of integers (`xs`).
- **Output:** The maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Solution Analysis

#### Edge Cases
1. **Empty List:**
   - The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a sensible choice as there are no elements to form a product.
   
2. **Single Element List:**
   - The function correctly returns the single element itself, as it is the only possible product.

#### Core Logic
- **Initialization:**
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

- **Iteration:**
  - For each subsequent element in the list, the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for the possibility of the current number being negative, which can flip the sign of the product.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum value to handle negative numbers effectively.

- **Final Check:**
  - After iterating through the list, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Correctness
- The function correctly handles the transition between positive and negative products by maintaining both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
- It efficiently finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist by considering all possible sublists.

### Example Verification
Let's test the function with a few examples to ensure its correctness.

```python
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # Maximum product subarray [2, 3]
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0    # Maximum product subarray [0]
    assert func_1([-2, 3, 0, -4, -5]) == 20  # Maximum product subarray [3, 0, -4, -5]
    assert func_1([-1]) == -1           # Single element
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')  # Empty list
    print("All tests passed!")

test_func_1()
```

### Conclusion
The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. The logic is sound, and it handles various edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the solution is correct.
