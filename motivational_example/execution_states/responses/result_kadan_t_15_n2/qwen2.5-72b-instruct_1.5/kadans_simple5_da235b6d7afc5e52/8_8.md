The provided Python solution does indeed aim to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a small mistake in the implementation. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product as the algorithm iterates through the list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and will store the overall maximum product found so far.

- **Loop**:
  - For each element in the list starting from the second one, we calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`).
  - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
  - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the same values. This is important because a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative product and vice versa.
  - We update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Correctness:
This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, including cases where the list contains only negative numbers or zeros. By keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products, it accounts for the possibility of turning a large negative product into a large positive product when encountering a negative number.

This solution has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\), making it efficient for this problem.
