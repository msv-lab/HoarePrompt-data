The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down how it works to understand its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which will store the overall maximum product found.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates three potential products:
     - `num` (the current element itself)
     - `temp` (the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`)
     - `min_ending_here * num` (the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`)
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of these three values.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of these three values. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a small product into a large product when multiplied.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list, as there is no valid sublist product.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element itself.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function handles negative numbers well by considering both the maximum and minimum products, which allows it to account for the possibility of a large positive product resulting from two negative numbers.

### Example
Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initial values: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- For `3`:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, -4) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, -4) = -4`
  - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`
- For `-2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 8) = 8`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 8) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, 8) = 8`
- For `4`:
  - `temp = 8 * 4 = 32`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 32, -48) = 32`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 32, -48) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = max(8, 32) = 32`

The function correctly returns `32`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.

### Conclusion
Yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
