The provided solution does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. Let's break down how the solution works and verify its correctness.

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current element `num`, the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the same three values. This helps in handling negative numbers, as multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.
     - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - After iterating through the list, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Verification

- **Handling Positive Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles sublists with only positive numbers.
- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The use of `min_ending_here` ensures that when a negative number is encountered, it can potentially turn a previously negative product into a large positive product.
- **Empty List**: The function returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable way to indicate that no valid product exists.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element for a list with only one element.

### Example Test Cases

Let's run some test cases to ensure the function works as expected:

```python
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # Sublist [2, 3] has the maximum product 6
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0  # Sublist [0] has the maximum product 0
    assert func_1([-2, -3, 7]) == 42  # Sublist [-2, -3, 7] has the maximum product 42
    assert func_1([-1, -3, -10, 0, 60]) == 60  # Sublist [60] has the maximum product 60
    assert func_1([-2, -3, 0, -2, -40]) == 80  # Sublist [-2, -40] has the maximum product 80
    assert func_1([0]) == 0  # Single element 0
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')  # Empty list

test_func_1()
```

All these test cases should pass, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
