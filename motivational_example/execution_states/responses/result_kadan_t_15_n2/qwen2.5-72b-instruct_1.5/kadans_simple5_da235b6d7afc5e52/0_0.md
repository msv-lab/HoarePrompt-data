The provided solution does address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. However, there is a small issue with the logic inside the loop that needs to be corrected for the function to work correctly in all cases. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done within the loop, not after it, to ensure that the best result found so far is always kept up-to-date.

Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary variable to hold the current max_ending_here value
        temp = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here considering the current number
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the highest value found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
1. **Temporary Variable**: The temporary variable `temp` is used to store the value of `max_ending_here` before it is updated. This ensures that the correct values are used when calculating both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

2. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The update of `best_so_far` is moved inside the loop to ensure that it captures the highest product at each step. This is crucial because the maximum product can change as we iterate through the list.

### Example Usage:
```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
```

This revised function should now correctly handle all edge cases and provide the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
