The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers. Let's break down how the function works to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

### Explanation of the Function

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which makes sense as there is no valid product for an empty list.
   - It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This initialization is necessary because the maximum product subarray could start at the first element.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function then iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - It calculates `temp` as the product of the current maximum product ending at the previous element and the current element (`max_ending_here * num`).
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element `num` (considering a new subarray starting here),
       - The product `temp` (continuing the current subarray),
       - The product of the current minimum product ending at the previous element and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`) (considering the effect of negative numbers).
     - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the same three values, which helps in handling negative numbers that can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by another negative number.

3. **Updating the Best Result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness of the Solution

The solution correctly handles various cases:
- **Positive Numbers**: The maximum product will be the product of all positive numbers.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly accounts for the possibility that a negative number followed by another negative number can result in a positive and potentially large product.
- **Zero**: The function treats zero as a potential start of a new subarray, effectively breaking the current subarray and starting fresh.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: Returns `float('-inf')`, which is a sensible default for an undefined maximum product.
- **Single Element List**: Returns the single element, as the maximum product of a single-element sublist is the element itself.
- **All Negative Numbers**: Returns the largest product possible, which could be a single negative number or a product of multiple negative numbers.
- **List with Zeros**: Correctly restarts the calculation after encountering zeros.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` is a correct and efficient solution to the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers. It handles all edge cases and ensures the correct result is returned.
