The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Here's a detailed explanation of how the function works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is important because multiplying by a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because there are no sublists, and thus no products to consider.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (since the first element is already considered in the initialization):
     - Calculate `temp`, which is the product of the current maximum product ending here (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness
- The function correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, as it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
- It also handles the case where the list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- The function efficiently finds the maximum product in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the list.

### Example
Let's test the function with a few examples to ensure its correctness:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([0]))            # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```

These test cases should confirm that the function works as expected.
