The provided solution to the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers is almost correct but has a minor issue in the state management and updating of `best_so_far`. The update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it reflects the maximum product found so far, after each iteration, and not just at the end. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function with the necessary changes:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum value of itself or max_ending_here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product found among all sublists.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This ensures that the initial state is correctly set before the loop begins.

2. **Loop Update**: Inside the loop, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to account for the current number (`num`) and its potential products with the previous maximum and minimum subproducts.

3. **Best So Far Update**: The key change is moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step to reflect the highest product found so far, rather than just at the end.

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
