The provided Python solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The approach taken is generally correct, but there is an issue with the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. This update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` reflects the highest maximum product found at each step of the iteration. Here's the corrected version of the function with the appropriate updates:

```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty.
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product at each step.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list and will store the maximum product found so far.
- **Loop**:
  - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
    - Calculate the temporary product `temp` of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
    - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
    - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
    - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**:
  - After the loop, return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly at each step, and the final result will be the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
