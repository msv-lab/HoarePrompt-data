The provided solution to find the maximum product of any sublist from a list of integers is mostly correct but has a few issues with the logic in updating the `best_so_far` variable and the final state descriptions. Let's break down the program and correct these issues:

### Corrected Program

```python
# State: `xs` is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary maximum product
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current element
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same; `num` is the last element of `xs`; 
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration;
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `best_so_far` is the highest maximum product found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to `xs[0]`. This ensures that the initial state is correctly set to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - Inside the loop, `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that it considers both positive and negative products.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to ensure it tracks the minimum product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - `best_so_far` is updated within the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

3. **Final State Description**:
   - The final state description is corrected to reflect that `best_so_far` is the highest maximum product found during the iteration.

### Final State Descriptions

- **Initial State**:
  - `xs` is a list of integers.
  - `xs` is not empty.
  - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to `xs[0]`.

- **After Loop**:
  - `xs` remains the same.
  - `num` is the last element of `xs`.
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration.
  - `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
  - `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
  - `best_so_far` is the highest maximum product found so far.

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
