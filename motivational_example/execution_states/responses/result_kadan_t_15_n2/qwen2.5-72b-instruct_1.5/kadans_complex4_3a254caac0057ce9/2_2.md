The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor logical flaw in the handling of the `best_so_far` variable. The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure it captures the highest product seen so far. Here's a corrected version of the function with appropriate comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return -inf if the list is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary product
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to the maximum of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum of itself and max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   
2. **Loop**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `best_so_far` to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated within the loop, capturing the highest product seen so far. The final state of `best_so_far` will be the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
