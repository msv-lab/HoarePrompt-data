The provided solution is mostly correct but contains a minor issue that affects the final result. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop, not outside. The current implementation only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far` after the loop has completed, which could miss out on the true maximum product if it occurred earlier in the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
2. **Loop Through Elements**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
   - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for both positive and negative numbers.
   - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the minimum product in case of negative numbers.
   - Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.
3. **Return Result**: After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This correction ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist, even if the maximum product occurs before the last element.
