The solution provided has some inaccuracies in the state comments and logic flow. Here's a more detailed explanation and corrected version of the function:

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which will store the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, we update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` by considering the current element, the product of the current element with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
   - This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, we check if this new value is better than `best_so_far` and update it if necessary.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Corrected Code with State Comments

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    # State: `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the first element,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the first element,
    # `best_so_far` is the first element of xs.
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
        
        # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the current element, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the current iteration,
        # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element,
        # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element,
        # `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Summary
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- The state comments are now more accurate and reflect the changes at each step of the iteration.
- The final return value is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem.
