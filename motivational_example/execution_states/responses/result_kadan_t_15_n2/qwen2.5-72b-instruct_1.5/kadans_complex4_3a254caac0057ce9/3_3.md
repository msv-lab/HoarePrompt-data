The provided solution has a few logical and implementation issues that need to be addressed. Let's go through the program step by step to understand the problems and the necessary corrections.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Final Update of `best_so_far`:**
   The final update of `best_so_far` inside the function is incorrect. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to keep track of the best product found so far. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once at the end, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **State Comments:**
   The state comments are not entirely accurate. For example, the comment after the loop does not correctly reflect the state of the variables. The `temp` variable is used inside the loop and is not relevant outside of it.

3. **Return Statement:**
   The return statement should be placed at the end of the function to ensure that the best product found during the entire iteration is returned.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the function with more accurate state comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: num is the current element being processed in the loop.
        # Calculate the temporary maximum product for the current element.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous max product,
        # and the product of the current element and the previous min product (to handle negative numbers).
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous max product,
        # and the product of the current element and the previous min product (to handle negative numbers).
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, min_ending_here is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of xs,
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of xs,
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found in xs.
    return best_so_far

# Example usage:
print(max_product_sublist([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(max_product_sublist([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

- **Loop:**
  - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
    - Calculate the temporary maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with the previous maximum product.
    - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
    - Update `min_ending_here` similarly to handle the case where the current element is negative.
    - Update `best_so_far` to the maximum product found so far.

- **Return:**
  - Return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This corrected version should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
