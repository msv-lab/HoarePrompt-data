The provided solution is almost correct, but there's a small mistake in the state update of `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version of the function with proper comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if xs is an empty list

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary maximum product considering the current number
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update the maximum and minimum products ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best so far with the maximum product found
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same; best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrections:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop**:
   - Inside the loop, `temp` is calculated as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to consider the current number, the product with the current `max_ending_here`, and the product with the current `min_ending_here`. This handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.
   - `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Return**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

### Corrected Comments:
- The comments now accurately reflect the state of the variables at each step of the program.
- The final comment clearly states that `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
