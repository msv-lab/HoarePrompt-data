The solution provided is almost correct but has a minor logical issue in how the `best_so_far` variable is updated. The `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always tracked. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program with a detailed explanation:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Loop through the rest of the elements in the list
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the potential new max and min products
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update the current max and min products
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # Update the best product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp_max`) considering the current number, the product of the current maximum product ending here and the current number, and the product of the current minimum product ending here and the current number.
     - Similarly, calculate the potential new minimum product (`temp_min`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` with these potential new values.
     - Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

3. **Return**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

This corrected version ensures that the `best_so_far` variable is updated correctly within the loop, reflecting the maximum product found at each step. This is crucial for accurately finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
