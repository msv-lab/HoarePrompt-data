The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is generally correct but there is a crucial mistake in the loop where the `best_so_far` variable should be updated inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function along with the explanation of the state at each step:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:  # Check if the list is empty
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]  # Initialize the minimum product ending here
    max_ending_here = xs[0]  # Initialize the maximum product ending here
    best_so_far = xs[0]  # Initialize the best product found so far

    for num in xs[1:]:  # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
        temp = max_ending_here * num  # Calculate the potential new maximum product
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)  # Update the maximum product ending here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)  # Update the minimum product ending here

        # Update the best product found so far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far  # Return the best product found
```

### Explanation of States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **After Empty Check**: If `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity.
- **Initialization State**: 
  - `min_ending_here` is set to the first element of `xs`.
  - `max_ending_here` is set to the first element of `xs`.
  - `best_so_far` is set to the first element of `xs`.
- **Inside Loop**:
  - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product ending here and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product ending here and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product ending here and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
- **Final State**: 
  - `xs` remains the same.
  - `num` is the last element of `xs`.
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration.
  - `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
  - `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
  - `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

The function now correctly updates `best_so_far` inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product is captured as the algorithm iterates through the list. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
