Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Initial Check:**
   ```python
   def func_1(xs):
       if (not xs):
           return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` because the product of an empty sublist is undefined. This is a valid approach for handling an empty list.

2. **Initialization of Variables:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - `num` itself.
       - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (`temp`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.
   - This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are correctly tracked because the presence of negative numbers can flip the sign of the product.

4. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the value of `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic correctly handles the case of an empty list.
- The initialization of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` is appropriate.
- The loop iterates through the list and updates the maximum and minimum products correctly, considering the effect of negative numbers.
- The final update to `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
