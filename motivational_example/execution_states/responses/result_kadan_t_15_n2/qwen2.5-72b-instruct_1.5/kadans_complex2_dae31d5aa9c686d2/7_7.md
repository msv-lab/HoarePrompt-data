Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview:
The function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list `xs`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `xs` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current element are considered, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf` to indicate that there is no valid sublist to consider.
  
- **Correct Handling of Negative Numbers:**
  - The function correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers. By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products, it can account for the effect of multiplying by a negative number (which can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa).

- **Update Logic:**
  - The update logic for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is correct. It considers the current element `num`, the product of the previous maximum product with the current element (`temp`), and the product of the previous minimum product with the current element.
  - This ensures that the algorithm correctly identifies the maximum product subarray even when the subarray includes negative numbers.

- **Final Return:**
  - The final return statement correctly returns the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct. It handles all edge cases and correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.

**Correctness: True**
