Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `max_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - After the loop, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
   - If so, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return `best_so_far`:**

### Detailed Step-by-Step Check:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `min_ending_here = xs[0]`
   - `max_ending_here = xs[0]`
   - `best_so_far = xs[0]`

2. **Loop Invariant:**
   - At the start of each iteration of the loop:
     - `min_ending_here` holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the previous element.
     - `max_ending_here` holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the previous element.
     - `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found so far.

3. **Loop Update:**
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num` calculates the product of the current maximum and the current element.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)` ensures that `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - The current element itself.
       - The product of the current maximum and the current element.
       - The product of the current minimum and the current element (to handle negative numbers).
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)` ensures that `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.

4. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` is checked against `best_so_far`.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and updates the maximum product accordingly. The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is sound, ensuring that the algorithm considers all possible sublists.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
