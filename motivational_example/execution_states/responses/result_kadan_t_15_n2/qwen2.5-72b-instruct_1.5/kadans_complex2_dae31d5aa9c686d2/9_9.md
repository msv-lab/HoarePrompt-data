Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Definition:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
```
- **Initial Check**: The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity. This is a reasonable base case because an empty list cannot have a valid product.

### Initialization:
```python
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
```
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is appropriate because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element sublist are the element itself.

### Loop Through the List:
```python
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
```
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through each element in the list starting from the second element.
- **Temporary Product**: `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
- **Update Maximum Product**: `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element `num`, the temporary product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This accounts for both positive and negative products.
- **Update Minimum Product**: `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element `num`, the temporary product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that the minimum product is also tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

### Final Update:
```python
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
```
- **Final Check**: After the loop, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

### Return Statement:
```python
    return best_so_far
```
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the base case of an empty list.
- The initialization and loop logic are designed to track both the maximum and minimum products, which is necessary for correctly handling sublists with negative numbers.
- The final update ensures that the best maximum product found is returned.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

**Correctness: True**
