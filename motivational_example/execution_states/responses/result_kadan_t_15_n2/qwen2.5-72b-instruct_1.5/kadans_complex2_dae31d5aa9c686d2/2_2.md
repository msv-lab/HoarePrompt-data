To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it step by step and ensure that it correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist of the given list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined (hence, the smallest possible value).
   - If the list is not empty, it initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here` to the first element of `xs`.
     - `max_ending_here` to the first element of `xs`.
     - `best_so_far` to the first element of `xs`.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - It calculates the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` and stores it in `temp`.
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of:
       - `num` itself.
       - `temp` (the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of:
       - `num` itself.
       - `temp` (the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - This step ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are tracked correctly, which is crucial for handling negative numbers and their effects on the product.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.
   - However, this check should be done inside the loop for each element, not just at the end.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Issues Identified:
- The update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, not outside. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once, after the loop, which means it might miss the actual maximum product if it occurs within the list.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the placement of the `best_so_far` update. The corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly within the loop, making it more accurate.

Correctness: **False**
