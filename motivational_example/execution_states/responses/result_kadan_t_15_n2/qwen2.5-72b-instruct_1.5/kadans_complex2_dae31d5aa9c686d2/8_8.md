Let's analyze the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1` which aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered undefined or the lowest possible value.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   These variables are initialized to the first element of the list:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number multiplied by the current minimum could become the new maximum.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the minimum product is also tracked correctly, as it might be used to update the maximum product in the next iteration.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop, this check updates `best_so_far` if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. However, this check is unnecessary because `best_so_far` is already being updated within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The provided function is almost correct but has a minor redundancy. The final update check outside the loop is not needed because `best_so_far` is already being updated within the loop. Removing this redundant check will not affect the correctness of the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The function, with the noted redundancy removed, is correct and will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
