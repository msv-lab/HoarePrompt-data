Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

### Code Analysis

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    return best_so_far
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `if (not xs): return float('-inf')`: This handles the edge case where the input list is empty. Returning negative infinity is appropriate because any valid product will be greater than this value.
   - `min_ending_here = xs[0]`: Initialize the minimum product ending at the current position to the first element.
   - `max_ending_here = xs[0]`: Initialize the maximum product ending at the current position to the first element.
   - `best_so_far = xs[0]`: Initialize the best product found so far to the first element.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: Calculate the product of the current maximum product ending here and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Update the maximum product ending at the current position. This considers three cases:
     - The current number itself.
     - The product of the current number and the previous maximum product.
     - The product of the current number and the previous minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
   - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Similarly, update the minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary to handle negative numbers that can turn a minimum product into a maximum product when multiplied by another negative number.

3. **Final Check:**
   - `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far): best_so_far = max_ending_here`: After the loop, check if the final maximum product ending at the last element is greater than the best product found so far. If so, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `return best_so_far`: Return the best product found during the iteration.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic of the program correctly handles all the necessary cases:
- It initializes the variables properly.
- It iterates through the list, updating the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
- It handles negative numbers correctly by considering both the maximum and minimum products.
- It updates the best product found so far after the loop.

### Conclusion
The given Python program is correct and will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
