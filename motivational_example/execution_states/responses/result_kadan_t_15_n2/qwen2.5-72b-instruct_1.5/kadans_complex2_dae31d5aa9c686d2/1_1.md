The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers `xs`. Let's break down the function to verify its correctness step by step.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`. This is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and `-inf` serves as a sentinel value indicating no valid product.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the product of the current number and the minimum product so far could be larger due to negative numbers.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` might have a value greater than `best_so_far`. If this is the case, `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Verification

- The function correctly handles the base case of an empty list.
- It initializes the necessary variables properly.
- The loop updates the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` variables to account for the current element and the effects of potential negative numbers.
- The final update ensures that the overall maximum product is returned.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1(xs)` is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
