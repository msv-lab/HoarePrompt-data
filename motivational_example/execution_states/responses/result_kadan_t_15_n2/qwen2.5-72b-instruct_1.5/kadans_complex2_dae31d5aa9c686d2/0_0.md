Let's carefully analyze the provided Python function `func_1` to determine its correctness in finding the maximum product of any sublist of a given integer list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because there are no products to consider in an empty list.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These initializations set the variables to the first element of the list. This is correct because the first element itself can be considered a valid sublist with its own product.

3. **Iteration Over the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list, the code calculates the temporary product `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element. This is crucial for handling cases with negative numbers, where the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

4. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this check updates `best_so_far` to the value of `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist of the input list `xs`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is correctly designed to find the maximum product of any sublist of a given integer list `xs`. The logic handles edge cases such as empty lists and negative numbers appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
