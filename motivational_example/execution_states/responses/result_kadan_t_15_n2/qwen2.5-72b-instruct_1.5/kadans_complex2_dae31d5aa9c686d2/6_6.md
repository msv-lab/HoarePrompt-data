The given Python program aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Let's break down the program step by step to verify its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   def func_1(xs):
       if (not xs):
           return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` is a safe choice to indicate this.

2. **Initialization of Variables:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the initial product of a single element is the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element `num` and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current element `num` and `min_ending_here`. This handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current element `num` and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we keep track of the minimum product, which is useful for handling negative numbers.

4. **Final Update and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` is compared with `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated.
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product of any sublist. The logic and steps are sound and follow the necessary conditions to ensure the correct result.

**Correctness: True**
