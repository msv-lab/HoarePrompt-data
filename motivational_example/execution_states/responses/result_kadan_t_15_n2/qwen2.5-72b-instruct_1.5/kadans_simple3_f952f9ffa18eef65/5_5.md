Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The approach used in the function is a dynamic programming technique that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current maximum product and the current element.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product (`temp`), and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values.
     - `best_so_far` is updated if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is found even when the sequence of products changes due to negative numbers.

Thus, the given program is correct.
