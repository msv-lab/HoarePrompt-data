Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which helps handle the effect of negative numbers on the product. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the current number and `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This handles the case where a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that the minimum product is tracked correctly, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero, and ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is found efficiently. Therefore, the given program is correct.
