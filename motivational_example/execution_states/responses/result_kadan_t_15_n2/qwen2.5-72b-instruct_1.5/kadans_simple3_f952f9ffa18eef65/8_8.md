Correctness: **False**

The given solution has a logical error that affects its ability to correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist for all possible inputs. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs earlier in the list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
2. **Loop Update**: Inside the loop, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

This ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the maximum product might occur early in the list and is not overwritten by subsequent calculations.
