Correctness: **False**

The given solution almost correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist, but there's a small issue in the way the `best_so_far` variable is updated. The `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop each time the `max_ending_here` is calculated, rather than only once at the end of the loop.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **min_ending_here**: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position, which is useful for handling negative numbers.
- **max_ending_here**: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
- **best_so_far**: Keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product is correctly captured as the algorithm iterates through the list. This fix ensures the function works correctly for all cases.
