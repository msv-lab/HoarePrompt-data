Correctness: **False**

The solution provided has a small logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. The issue lies in the update of `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum value at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist. The issue with the original code was that `best_so_far` was only being updated once after the loop, which could miss updates that occur within the loop.
