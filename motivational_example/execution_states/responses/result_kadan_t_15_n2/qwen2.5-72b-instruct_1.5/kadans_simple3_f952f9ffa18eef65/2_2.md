Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct, but there is a crucial mistake that could cause it to fail in some cases. Specifically, the update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always updated correctly as the loop progresses. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss the correct maximum product if it occurs within the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.
