**Correctness: False**

The issue with the given program lies in the way it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The current program updates `best_so_far` only when it finds a new maximum value at the end of the iteration, but it should be updated at every step when it encounters a new maximum.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` always stores the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
