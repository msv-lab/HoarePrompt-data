**Yes**, the provided Python solution does solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Handling edge case**: The solution correctly handles the edge case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).
2. **Initializing variables**: The solution initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` to keep track of the maximum product seen so far.
3. **Iterating through the list**: The solution iterates through the list `xs` starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
4. **Updating variables**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
     - The current number `num`.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (using a temporary variable `temp` to avoid an instruction relying on partially updated values).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
     - The current number `num`.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
5. **Updating best_so_far**: If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.
6. **Returning the result**: Finally, the solution returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list `xs`, and a space complexity of O(1) since it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.

**Example use case**:
```python
xs = [-2, 3, -4]
result = func_1(xs)
print(result)  # Output: 24
```
In this example, the maximum product of any sublist is `(-2) * (3) * (-4) = 24`, which is correctly returned by the `func_1` function.
