Correctness: **False**

The issue with the given program lies in the way it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` after the loop finishes. However, it should update `best_so_far` whenever it finds a maximum product that is greater than the current `best_so_far` during the iteration.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
