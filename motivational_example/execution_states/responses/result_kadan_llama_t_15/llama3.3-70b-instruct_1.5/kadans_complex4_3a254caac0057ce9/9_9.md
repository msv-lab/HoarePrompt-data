# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input and is intended to find the maximum product of any sublist.
2. The initial checks and variable assignments seem to be correct. The function handles the case when `xs` is empty, returning `-inf` as per the expectations.
3. The main loop iterates over the list `xs` from the second element to the end.
4. **Inside the loop, a temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.** This is done to evaluate the product of the current sublist ending at `num`.
5. The **maximum and minimum product ending at the current position** are then updated. For `max_ending_here`, the function takes the maximum of the current number `num`, the temporary product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always stores the maximum product of the sublists ending at the current position. The same logic is applied for `min_ending_here` but with the minimum function to handle negative numbers correctly.
6. **After the loop, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.** However, **this seems to be incomplete because `best_so_far` is only initialized with the first element of `xs` and not updated inside the loop when a new maximum product is found**.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    """
    Find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.

    Args:
        xs (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum product of any sublist.
    """
    if not xs:  # Handle the case when the list is empty
        return float('-inf')

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if a new maximum product is found
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far

# Test the function
print(max_product_sublist([2,3,-2,4]))  # Output: 6
print(max_product_sublist([-2,0,-1]))  # Output: 0
print(max_product_sublist([0,2]))      # Output: 2
```

# Explanation of changes:
*   **Added an update for `best_so_far` inside the loop** to ensure that it always stores the maximum product found so far, including the maximum product of sublists ending at each position.
*   **Improved the function documentation** to provide a clear description of what the function does, its arguments, and its return value.
