# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input and is supposed to return the maximum product of any sublist.
2. The initial checks and variable assignments seem to be correct.
3. The main issue lies in the fact that `best_so_far` is never actually updated throughout the entire loop. The line where it is supposed to be updated (`if (max_ending_here > best_so_far)` line) is **after** the loop finishes. So, it will only update `best_so_far` with the maximum product of the sublist ending at the last element.
4. To fix this, we need to move the `best_so_far` update inside the loop, so it checks after each iteration whether the current `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.
5. Additionally, `best_so_far` should be initialized with the first element of the list but then also updated as we iterate through the list, if we find a larger product.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    # check for empty list
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    # initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    # start the loop from the second element (index 1)
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # store max_ending_here * num in a temporary variable
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # return the maximum product found
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
*   Moved the `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far)` line inside the loop.
*   `best_so_far` now gets updated whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
*   This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.

# Tests and example uses:
To verify the correctness of this solution, test it with various lists, including lists with negative numbers, lists with all positive numbers, and edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single element.

```python
# test case 1: list with positive numbers
print(func_1([2, 3, 4]))  # output: 24

# test case 2: list with negative numbers
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))  # output: 24

# test case 3: empty list
print(func_1([]))  # output: -inf

# test case 4: list with a single element
print(func_1([5]))  # output: 5
```
