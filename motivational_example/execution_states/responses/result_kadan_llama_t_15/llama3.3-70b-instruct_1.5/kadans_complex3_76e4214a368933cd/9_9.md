Correctness: **False**

The issue with the given program lies in the way it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` after the loop finishes. However, it does not update `best_so_far` inside the loop when it encounters a new maximum product. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    # State: `xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected code, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to keep track of the maximum product seen so far. This way, `best_so_far` will always hold the maximum product of any sublist, including the ones that end at the current position.
