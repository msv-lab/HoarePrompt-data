Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is checked if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling empty list**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is correct.
- **Loop logic**:
  - The use of `temp` to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` is correct.
  - Updating `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
  - Similarly, updating `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num` ensures that we keep track of the smallest product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: The check and update of `best_so_far` inside the loop ensure that we always have the maximum product found so far.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
