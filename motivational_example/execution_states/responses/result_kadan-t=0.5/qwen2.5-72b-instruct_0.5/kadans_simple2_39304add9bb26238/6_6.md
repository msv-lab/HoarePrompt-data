Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that it will not be considered as a valid maximum product.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (i.e., `xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current element `num`.
       - The product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here` (to handle negative numbers).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.
     - This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position are tracked, which is crucial for handling negative numbers and zero.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It accounts for edge cases, handles negative numbers and zeros appropriately, and efficiently updates the maximum product found so far.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
