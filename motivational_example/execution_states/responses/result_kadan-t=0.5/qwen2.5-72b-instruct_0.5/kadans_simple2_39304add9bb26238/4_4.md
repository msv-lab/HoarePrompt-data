Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function `func_1(xs)` starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable approach because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that any valid product will be larger.
   - If the list is not empty, the initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum product of a single-element sublist is the element itself.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - It calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating the Best Product:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It handles edge cases (empty list) and correctly updates the maximum and minimum products at each step to account for negative numbers.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
