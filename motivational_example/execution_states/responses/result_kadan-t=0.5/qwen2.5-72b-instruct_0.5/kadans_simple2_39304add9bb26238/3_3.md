Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that it will not be considered as a valid result.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous element.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous element, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous element.
   - This approach accounts for the possibility that multiplying a negative number by another negative number can result in a positive number, which could potentially be the maximum product.

4. **Updating the Best Result:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It properly initializes variables, iterates through the list, and updates the maximum and minimum products to account for both positive and negative numbers.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
