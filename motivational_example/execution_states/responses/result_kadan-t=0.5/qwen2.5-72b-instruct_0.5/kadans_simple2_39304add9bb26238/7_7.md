Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined (or can be considered as the smallest possible value).

   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively. `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Loop Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a large negative number can become a large positive number.

3. **Update the Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product found.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which is essential for handling negative numbers and ensuring the correct result.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
