Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to solve this problem. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that it will be less than any valid product.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (i.e., `xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number itself might be larger than the product, or that the product of the minimum ending here and the current number might be larger due to negative numbers.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product, which is important for handling negative numbers.

4. **Updating the Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge case of an empty list.
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is correct and accounts for both positive and negative numbers.
- The final value of `best_so_far` will indeed be the maximum product of any sublist.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
