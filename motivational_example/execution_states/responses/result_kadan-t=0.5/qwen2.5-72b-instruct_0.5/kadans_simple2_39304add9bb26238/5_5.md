Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to solve this problem. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that any valid product will be greater.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (i.e., `xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying the current number with the previous minimum product might yield a new maximum.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying the current number with the previous maximum product might yield a new minimum.
     - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Check:
- **Handling Empty List:** The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- **Initialization:** The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is appropriate.
- **Loop Logic:** The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products, ensuring that the maximum product is tracked correctly.
- **Final Result:** The final result is stored in `best_so_far`, which is returned at the end of the function.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as intended for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

**Correctness: True**
