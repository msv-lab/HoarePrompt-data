Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - This initialization ensures that we start with the first element as the current maximum and minimum products.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning negative infinity indicates that no valid product exists.

3. **Loop Through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we consider the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we keep track of the minimum product, which is important for handling negative numbers and ensuring we can correctly calculate the maximum product.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It initializes variables appropriately, handles edge cases, and updates the maximum and minimum products correctly within the loop.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
