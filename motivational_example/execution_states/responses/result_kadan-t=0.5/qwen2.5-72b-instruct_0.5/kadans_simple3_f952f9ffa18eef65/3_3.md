Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly computing the maximum product of any sublist in all cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product found during the iteration. The correct approach should update `best_so_far` within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, capturing the maximum product found so far. This is crucial for correctly handling cases where the maximum product might occur in the middle of the list.
