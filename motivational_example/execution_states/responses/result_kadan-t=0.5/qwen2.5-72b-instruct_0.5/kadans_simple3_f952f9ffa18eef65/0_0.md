Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist.
