Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can cause it to miss the correct maximum product of a sublist. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product if it occurs before the last iteration.

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop every time `max_ending_here` is computed. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, even if it occurs before the last element in the list.
