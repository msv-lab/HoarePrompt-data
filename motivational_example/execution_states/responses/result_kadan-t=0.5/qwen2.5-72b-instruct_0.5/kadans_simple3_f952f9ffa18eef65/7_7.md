Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` is only checked at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum value correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration of the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always captured correctly. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
