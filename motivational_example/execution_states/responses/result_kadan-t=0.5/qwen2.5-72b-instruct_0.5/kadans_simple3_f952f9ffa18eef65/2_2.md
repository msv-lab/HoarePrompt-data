Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that can cause it to produce incorrect results. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure it always captures the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
