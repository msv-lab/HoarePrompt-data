Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can cause it to produce incorrect results. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last element in the list.

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` is updated. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, a more concise and correct way to update `best_so_far` is to do it directly in the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, even if the maximum product occurs before the last element in the list.
