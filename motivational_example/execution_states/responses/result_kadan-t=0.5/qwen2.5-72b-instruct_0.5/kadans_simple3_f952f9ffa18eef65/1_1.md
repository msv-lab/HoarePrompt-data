Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly computing the maximum product of any sublist for all possible inputs. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it does not track the maximum product found so far throughout the entire list. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist for all possible inputs.
