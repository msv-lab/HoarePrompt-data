The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the logic for updating `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code updates `best_so_far` only after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product found during the iteration. By moving the update inside the loop, we ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

2. **Comments**: The comments have been adjusted to reflect the correct state of the variables at each step.

### Correctness:
- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list.
- **Non-Empty List**: The function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist by keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each element. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one and vice versa.

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases.
