The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far at each step. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to the maximum of the current number, the product of max_ending_here and the current number, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of the current number, the product of max_ending_here and the current number, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum of itself and max_ending_here.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.
2. **Loop Update**: Inside the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` at each iteration. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It accounts for the possibility of the list being empty by returning `-inf`.
- The use of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` helps in handling sublists with negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is correctly calculated even when the sign changes.

This revised function should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
