The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code updates `best_so_far` only once at the end of the loop. This can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found before the last element. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product found at any point is captured.

2. **Initial State Comments**: The initial state comments have been adjusted to reflect the correct state of the variables before the loop starts.

3. **Final State Comments**: The final state comments have been updated to reflect the correct state of the variables after the loop completes.

This corrected version should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
