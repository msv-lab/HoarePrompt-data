The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to capture the maximum product so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` because there are no sublists to consider.
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position, and the best product found so far, respectively.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element. For each element:
  - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list, which is returned.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist.
