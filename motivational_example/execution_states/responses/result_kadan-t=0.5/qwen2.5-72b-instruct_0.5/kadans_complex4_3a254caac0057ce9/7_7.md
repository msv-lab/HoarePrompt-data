The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum value found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product found at each step is captured.

### Corrected States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **After Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of `xs`.
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Final State**: `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
