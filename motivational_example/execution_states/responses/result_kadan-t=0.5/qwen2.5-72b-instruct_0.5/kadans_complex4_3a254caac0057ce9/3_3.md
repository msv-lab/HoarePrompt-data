The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the final state update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is continuously updated as the algorithm progresses through the list. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to capture the best product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Loop Update**: The update of `best_so_far` is moved inside the loop. This ensures that the algorithm correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist as it iterates through the list.
2. **Final State**: The final state comment is updated to reflect the correct values of `num`, `temp`, `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` after the loop completes.

This corrected version will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
