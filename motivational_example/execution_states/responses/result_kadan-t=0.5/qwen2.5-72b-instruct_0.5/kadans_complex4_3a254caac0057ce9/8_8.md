The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the final state update of `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code updates `best_so_far` only after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.

2. **Final State Comment**: The final state comment has been updated to reflect the correct state after the loop completes.

This corrected version should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
