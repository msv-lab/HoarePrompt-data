The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found up to the current point in the list, which is necessary for correctly handling cases where the maximum product might occur at different points in the list.
