Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
