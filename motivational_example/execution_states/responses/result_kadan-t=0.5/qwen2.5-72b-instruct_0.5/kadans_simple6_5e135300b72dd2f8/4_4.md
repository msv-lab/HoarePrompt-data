Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is updated at each step. Currently, the update is outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`, potentially missing the actual maximum product.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Alternatively, you can simplify the update of `best_so_far` by using the `max` function directly:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated at each step of the iteration.
