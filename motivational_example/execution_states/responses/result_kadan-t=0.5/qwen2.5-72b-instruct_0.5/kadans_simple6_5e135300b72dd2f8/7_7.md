Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds `best_so_far`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, a more concise and correct way to write this would be:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated correctly within the loop.
