Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum value at each step. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which can miss the maximum value if it occurs within the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist.
