Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. The issue lies in the fact that the `best_so_far` variable is not being updated inside the loop correctly. Specifically, the update to `best_so_far` should be done within the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist.
