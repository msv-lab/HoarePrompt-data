The provided program aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we consider the possibility of a negative number turning a large negative product into a large positive product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far` to update the best product found so far.

3. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis:
- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The use of both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the algorithm can handle negative numbers effectively. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Updating Best So Far**: The comparison `if max_ending_here > best_so_far` is unnecessary because `best_so_far` is already updated inside the loop. However, this does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
