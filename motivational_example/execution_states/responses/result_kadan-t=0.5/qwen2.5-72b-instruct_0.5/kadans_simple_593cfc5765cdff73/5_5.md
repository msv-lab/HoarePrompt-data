### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The approach used is a dynamic programming technique that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Update `best_so_far` inside the loop**: The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which might miss some potential maximum products.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Correctness:

After making the correction to update `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist. Therefore, the corrected function is:

Correctness: **True**
