The provided program aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and reasoning behind the code to determine its correctness.

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we consider the possibility of a negative number turning a large negative product into a large positive product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest product, which can be useful when a negative number is encountered later.
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far` to update `best_so_far` if necessary.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Potential Issues

- **Update of `best_so_far`**: The current implementation updates `best_so_far` only once after the loop. However, it should be updated inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at each step is considered.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a minor issue where `best_so_far` is not updated correctly inside the loop. After fixing this, the program should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: False**

However, with the correction provided, the program becomes correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Correctness: True** (after the correction)
