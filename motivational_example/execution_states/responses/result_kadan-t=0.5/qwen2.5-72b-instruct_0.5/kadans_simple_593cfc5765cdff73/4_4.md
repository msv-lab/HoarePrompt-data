Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subsequence (sublist) in a given list of integers.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` is designed to solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying `max_ending_here` with `num`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the minimum product is correctly tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It correctly updates the minimum and maximum products at each step, ensuring that the maximum product is found even when the list contains negative numbers.
- The initialization and boundary conditions are handled properly (e.g., returning `-inf` for an empty list).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.

Correctness: **True**
