Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview
The function `func_1(xs)` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is a valid approach because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered as the smallest possible value.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` is compared with `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`. The use of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the algorithm handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately, and the final result is correctly updated and returned.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
