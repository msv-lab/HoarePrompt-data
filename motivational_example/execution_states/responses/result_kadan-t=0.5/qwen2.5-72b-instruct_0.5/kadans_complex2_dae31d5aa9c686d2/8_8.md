Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview
The function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

### Initial Checks
1. **Empty List Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` indicates that no valid product exists.

### Initialization
2. **Initialization of Variables**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

### Iteration
3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.

### Final Update
4. **Final Update of `best_so_far`**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` contains the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of the list.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

### Return Statement
5. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Analysis
- The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty.
- The initialization and iteration logic correctly update the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at each position.
- The final update ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct. It correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

**Correctness: True**
