Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    return best_so_far
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty.
   - If `xs` is empty, it returns `-inf` because there are no sublists to consider, and the maximum product of an empty list is undefined (hence `-inf`).

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current maximum product and the current element, and the product of the current minimum product and the current element.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current maximum product and the current element, and the product of the current minimum product and the current element.
   - This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are tracked, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this checks if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
   - If so, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`. It handles both positive and negative numbers and updates the maximum and minimum products appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
**Correctness: True**
