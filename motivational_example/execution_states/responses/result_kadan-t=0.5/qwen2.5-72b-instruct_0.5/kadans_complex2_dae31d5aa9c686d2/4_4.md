Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview:
The function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and negative infinity is a safe default.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element sublist are the element itself.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current element `num` (considering the element as a new sublist).
       - The product of the current maximum product and the current element (`temp`).
       - The product of the current minimum product and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values.
   - This approach correctly accounts for the possibility that a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the maximum value between the current `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
   - However, this update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness:
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is correct.
- The initialization and handling of the empty list are correct.
- The only issue is that the update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. After correcting this, the program will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True** (with the noted correction).
