Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the first element itself is a valid sublist.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product ending at the previous element and the current element.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product.
   - This logic correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum and minimum products are tracked correctly.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the maximum value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
   - However, this update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should contain the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Issue:
The line `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) : best_so_far = max_ending_here` should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list. As it stands, the update only happens once after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is **incorrect** due to the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The corrected code ensures that `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, making it correct.

Correctness: **False**
