Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list:**
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Empty List:**
  - The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.

- **Initialization:**
  - Initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list is correct because it sets the initial state for the first element.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.
  - The use of `temp` ensures that the current `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are not used in the same calculation, which could lead to incorrect results.

- **Final Update:**
  - The final update of `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
