Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview
The function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the list `xs`.

### Initial Checks
1. **Empty List Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`-inf`). This is a valid base case because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning `-inf` indicates that no valid product exists.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

### Iteration
3. **Loop Through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - The current element `num` (considering the element as a new sublist).
       - The product of the current maximum product and the current element (`temp`).
       - The product of the current minimum product and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
       - The current element `num`.
       - The product of the current maximum product and the current element (`temp`).
       - The product of the current minimum product and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`).

### Final Update
4. **Update Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

### Return Statement
5. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, return the best (maximum) product found.

### Analysis
- The function correctly handles the base case of an empty list.
- The initialization and updates of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.
- The loop iterates through the list and updates the variables appropriately to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct and will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist within the input list `xs`.

**Correctness: True**
