Let's analyze the provided Python function step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element `num` and the maximum product of the previous sublist (`max_ending_here`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
       - The current element `num`.
       - The product of the current element and the maximum product of the previous sublist (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and the minimum product of the previous sublist (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values.
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, as the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the maximum product found during the iteration if it is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all edge cases and iterates through the list to find the maximum product of any sublist. The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is sound, ensuring that both positive and negative products are considered.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
