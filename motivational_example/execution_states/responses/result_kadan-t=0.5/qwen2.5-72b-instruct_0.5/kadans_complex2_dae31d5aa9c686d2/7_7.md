Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Program Analysis

#### Function Definition
```python
def func_1(xs):
```
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input.

#### Initial Check
```python
if (not xs) :
    return float('-inf')
```
- If the list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` is a reasonable way to handle this case.

#### Initialization
```python
min_ending_here = xs[0]
max_ending_here = xs[0]
best_so_far = xs[0]
```
- `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

#### Iteration
```python
for num in xs[1:]:
    temp = max_ending_here * num
    
    max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
```
- The loop iterates over each element in the list starting from the second element.
- `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
- `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
- `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

#### Final Update
```python
if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
```
- After the loop, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

#### Return Statement
```python
return best_so_far
```
- The function returns the value of `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list.
2. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is appropriate.
3. **Iteration Logic**:
   - The use of `temp` to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num` is correct.
   - The update of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considers all possible products (current element, product with `max_ending_here`, and product with `min_ending_here`), which is necessary to handle both positive and negative numbers.
4. **Final Update**: The final check to update `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.

Correctness: **True**
