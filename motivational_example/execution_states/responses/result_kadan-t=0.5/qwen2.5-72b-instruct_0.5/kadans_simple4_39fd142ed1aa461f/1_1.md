The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the code to ensure it correctly addresses the problem.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

The logic of the function is correct and follows the Kadane's algorithm adapted for the maximum product subarray problem. Here are the key points that ensure its correctness:

- **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling negative numbers**: By maintaining both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the function can handle cases where the product of two negative numbers becomes positive.
- **Updating the best result**: The function correctly updates `best_so_far` to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with a few test cases:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 4]))  # Expected output: 4 (sublist [4])
```

All these test cases should produce the expected results, confirming that the function works correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and effectively solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
