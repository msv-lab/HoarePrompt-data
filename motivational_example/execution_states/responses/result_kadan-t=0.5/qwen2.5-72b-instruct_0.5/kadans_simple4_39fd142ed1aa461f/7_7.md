The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the code to determine its correctness.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness

- **Handling empty list**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling negative numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: The function updates `best_so_far` after the loop, ensuring that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to verify the correctness:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`

3. **Second iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`

4. **Third iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`

5. **Final update**:
   - `best_so_far = max(2, 4) = 4`

The function correctly returns `4`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct. It effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
