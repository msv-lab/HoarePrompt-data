The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the code step by step to ensure its correctness.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider, and thus no valid product.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and will store the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the same three values. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

4. **Updating the Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

The logic of the function is sound and follows the Kadane's algorithm adapted for finding the maximum product subarray. The key points are:
- Handling the case where the list is empty.
- Properly initializing the variables.
- Correctly updating the maximum and minimum products at each step.
- Ensuring that the best result is tracked throughout the iteration.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List:** Returns `-inf`, which is correct.
- **List with All Positive Numbers:** Works correctly.
- **List with All Negative Numbers:** Works correctly, as it considers the minimum product to handle negative numbers.
- **List with Zeros:** Works correctly, as zeros reset the product to zero, which is handled by the algorithm.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and should work for all valid inputs. It efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the list.
