The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product, which is useful for handling negative numbers.
     - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the list, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers. By keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position, it can handle the sign changes appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- **Optimality**: The function uses a dynamic programming approach with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is optimal for this problem.

### Example Verification

Let's test the function with a few examples to ensure it works as expected:

```python
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # Sublist [2, 3] has the maximum product 6
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0    # Sublist [0] has the maximum product 0
    assert func_1([-2, 3, -4]) == 24   # Sublist [-2, 3, -4] has the maximum product 24
    assert func_1([0, 2, -3, 4]) == 4  # Sublist [4] has the maximum product 4
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf') # Empty list should return negative infinity

test_func_1()
```

If all these tests pass, it confirms that the function is working correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
