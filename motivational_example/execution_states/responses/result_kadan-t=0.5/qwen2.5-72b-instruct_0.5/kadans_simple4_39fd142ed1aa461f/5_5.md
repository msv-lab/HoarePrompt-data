The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the correctness and efficiency of this solution.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum products ending at the first element are the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which is the best product found so far.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`. This represents the potential new maximum product ending at the current element.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current element.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current element, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases and Special Considerations

- **Empty List**: The function correctly handles an empty list by returning `float('-inf')`, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element as the maximum product.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by maintaining both the maximum and minimum products ending at each element, which is crucial for cases where the product of two negative numbers becomes positive and potentially larger.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 12 (sublist [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 5]))  # Expected output: 5 (sublist [5])
```

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficient. It correctly handles all edge cases and special considerations, ensuring that it finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time, O(n). Therefore, the solution is indeed correct.
