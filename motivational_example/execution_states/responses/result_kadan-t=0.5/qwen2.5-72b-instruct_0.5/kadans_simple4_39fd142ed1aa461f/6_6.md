The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
- **Input**: A list of integers.
- **Output**: The maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the input list.

### Solution Breakdown
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.
   - All three are initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with `max_ending_here`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After each iteration, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the result.

### Correctness Check
- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns negative infinity for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no products to consider.
- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by another negative number.
- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle edge cases such as all elements being negative, all elements being positive, and mixed elements correctly.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 12 (sublist [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 4]))  # Expected output: 4 (sublist [4])
```

### Conclusion
The provided solution is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. It handles various edge cases and correctly updates the maximum and minimum products to account for negative numbers and zero values.
