The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the correctness of the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: A list of integers.
2. **Output**: The maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within the input list.

### Key Points in the Solution
- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
  - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
    - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with the previous maximum product.
    - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
    - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
    - Update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Handling Empty List**:
   - The function correctly returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) if the input list is empty, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is correct.

3. **Iteration**:
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
   - This ensures that the algorithm can handle negative numbers and zero, which can flip the sign of the product and affect the maximum and minimum products.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is stored in `best_so_far`, which is updated whenever a new maximum product is found.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through an example to ensure the logic works as expected.

**Example Input**: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First Iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
   - `best_so_far = 6`

3. **Second Iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
   - `best_so_far = 6`

4. **Third Iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
   - `best_so_far = 6`

**Final Result**: `6`

### Conclusion
The provided solution is correct. It correctly handles various cases, including negative numbers and zero, and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time.
