Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the final part where it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly. This check should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, capturing the maximum product found so far. The current implementation only checks this condition once, after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the iteration.
