Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the placement of the final check to update `best_so_far`. The check should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly tracks the maximum product found so far, ensuring that the final result is accurate.
