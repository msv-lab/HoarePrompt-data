Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far at each step. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it will only consider the last value of `max_ending_here` and not the maximum value encountered during the entire iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far. This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
