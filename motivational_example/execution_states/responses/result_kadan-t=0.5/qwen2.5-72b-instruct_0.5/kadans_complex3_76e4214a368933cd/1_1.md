Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the placement of the final check to update `best_so_far`. The check should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, not just at the end. This is crucial because the maximum product might occur at any point in the list, not necessarily at the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`).
  - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
  - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
  - Update `best_so_far` to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.
