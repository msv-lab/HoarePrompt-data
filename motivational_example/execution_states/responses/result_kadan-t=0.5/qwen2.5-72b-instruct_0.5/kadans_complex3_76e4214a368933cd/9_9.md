Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the placement of the update to `best_so_far` outside the loop. This means that `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop has completed, using the final value of `max_ending_here`. However, the maximum product of any sublist could occur at any point during the iteration, not just at the end.

To fix this, the update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, so that it captures the maximum product found at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
