Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the final part of the function where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be done inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far. In the current implementation, the update is only attempted once after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found before the last iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product of any sublist as the loop progresses. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product.
