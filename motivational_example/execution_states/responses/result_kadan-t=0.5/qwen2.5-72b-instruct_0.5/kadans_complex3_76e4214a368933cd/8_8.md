Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that affects its correctness. The issue lies in the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop has completed. This means that if the maximum product occurs before the last element in the list, it will not be captured.

To fix this, the update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, so that it can track the maximum product found at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
