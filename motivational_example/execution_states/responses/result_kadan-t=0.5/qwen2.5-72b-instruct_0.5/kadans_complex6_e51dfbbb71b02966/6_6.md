Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the final part where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step with the maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly tracked throughout the entire list. This ensures that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
