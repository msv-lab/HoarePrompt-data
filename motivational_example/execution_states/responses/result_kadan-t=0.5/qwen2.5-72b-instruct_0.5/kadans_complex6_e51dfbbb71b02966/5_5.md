Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration, capturing the maximum product found so far. As it stands, the update is outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`, potentially missing out on the actual maximum product found during the iterations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist.
