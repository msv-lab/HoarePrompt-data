Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the final part of the function where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, not just at the end. This is crucial because the maximum product can occur at any point during the iteration, not necessarily at the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
        #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the current element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the current iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist as the function iterates through the list.
