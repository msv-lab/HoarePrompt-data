Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that could lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, the update for `best_so_far` is only done after the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`. However, the maximum product of a sublist could occur at any point during the iteration, not just at the end.

To fix this, the update for `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, so that it is checked and potentially updated after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
