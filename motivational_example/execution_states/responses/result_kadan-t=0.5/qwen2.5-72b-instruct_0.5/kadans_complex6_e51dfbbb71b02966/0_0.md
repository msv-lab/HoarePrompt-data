Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far.
- Moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist, even if it occurs before the last element.

This correction will ensure that the function works correctly for all cases.
