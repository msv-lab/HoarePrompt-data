Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that affects its correctness. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `best_so_far` variable is updated. The update should be done inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always tracked correctly. However, in the given code, the update is done outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
