Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist within the input list `xs`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element sublist are the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the function calculates the potential new maximum and minimum products that can be formed by including the current element.
   - `temp` stores the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. This ensures that the final result is the maximum product found during the entire iteration.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf` to indicate that no valid product can be computed.

The state comments accurately describe the state of the variables at each step, and the logic of the function is sound. Therefore, the solution is correct.
