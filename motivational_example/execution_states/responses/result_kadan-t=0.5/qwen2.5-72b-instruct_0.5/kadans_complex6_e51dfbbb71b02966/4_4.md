Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that affects its correctness. The issue lies in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop, which means it will only consider the last value of `max_ending_here` from the loop. However, the maximum product could occur at any point during the iteration, and thus `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the highest value found so far.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, `best_so_far` is updated correctly within the loop, ensuring that the function returns the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
