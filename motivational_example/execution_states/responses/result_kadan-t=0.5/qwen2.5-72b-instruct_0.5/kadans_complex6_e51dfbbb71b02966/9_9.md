Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the final part of the function where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always stored correctly. This ensures that the function will return the maximum product of any sublist, as required by the problem statement.
