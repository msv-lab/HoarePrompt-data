Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is continuously updated as the loop iterates through the list. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop has completed, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product is found before the last iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the highest product found up to the current point in the list. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist.
