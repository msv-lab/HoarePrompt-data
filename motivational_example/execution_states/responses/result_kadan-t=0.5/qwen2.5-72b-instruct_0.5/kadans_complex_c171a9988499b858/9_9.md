Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the placement of the update statement for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration, capturing the maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated after each iteration, reflecting the maximum product of any subarray encountered up to that point.
