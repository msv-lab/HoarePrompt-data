Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the final part where it updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far after each iteration. In the current implementation, the update is outside the loop, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`, potentially missing out on the actual maximum product.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the update to `best_so_far` is performed within the loop, ensuring that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.
