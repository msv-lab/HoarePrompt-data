Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the placement of the update statement for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `best_so_far` variable is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found up to the current element. This ensures that the final value returned is indeed the maximum product of any subarray in the list `xs`.
