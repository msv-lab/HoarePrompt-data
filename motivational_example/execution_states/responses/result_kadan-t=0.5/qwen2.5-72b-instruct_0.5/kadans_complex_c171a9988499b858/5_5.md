Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found up to the current element. This ensures that the final result is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
