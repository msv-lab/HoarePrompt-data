Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is updated after each iteration. Currently, the update is outside the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far` after the loop has completed, potentially missing out on the actual maximum product.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, ensuring that the maximum product found at each step is considered. This will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist.
