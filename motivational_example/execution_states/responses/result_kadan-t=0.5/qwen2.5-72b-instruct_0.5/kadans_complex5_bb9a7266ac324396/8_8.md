The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is continuously updated as the algorithm progresses through the list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to track the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `best_so_far` to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
