The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always tracked correctly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

### Corrected States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **After Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of `xs`.
- **Inside Loop**:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
- **Final State**: `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This ensures that the function correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
