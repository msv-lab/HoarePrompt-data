The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the loop where it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is updated at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    #State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current element itself might be larger than the product, or that the product of the current element and the minimum product so far (which could be negative) might yield a larger positive product.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` to ensure that the best product found so far is always stored.
- **Return**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that the `best_so_far` is updated at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist correctly.
