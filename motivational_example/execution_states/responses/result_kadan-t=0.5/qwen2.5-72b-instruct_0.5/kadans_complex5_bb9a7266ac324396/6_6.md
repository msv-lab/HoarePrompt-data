The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here` (to handle negative numbers).
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum to handle negative products.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to keep track of the best product found so far.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
