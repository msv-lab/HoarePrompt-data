The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product. This handles both positive and negative numbers.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of these values, which helps in handling negative numbers that can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to keep track of the best product found so far.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list.
