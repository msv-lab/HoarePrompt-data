The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Corrected State Comments:
- **State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **State**: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty.
- **State**: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the current element being processed, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
- **State**: `xs` is a list of integers, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated correctly throughout the iteration, capturing the maximum product of any sublist.
