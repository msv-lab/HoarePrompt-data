The provided solution is mostly correct but has a small issue in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration, capturing the best possible product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the best product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iterations.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss the best product if it occurs before the last element. By moving the update inside the loop, we ensure that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far.

### Example:
Let's test the function with a sample input to verify its correctness:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (from the sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (the maximum product is 0, since all other products are negative)
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (from the sublist [-2, -3, 7])
```

This should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
