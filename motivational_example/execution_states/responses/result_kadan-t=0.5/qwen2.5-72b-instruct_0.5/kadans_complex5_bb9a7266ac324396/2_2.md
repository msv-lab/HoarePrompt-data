The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the best (maximum) product found so far.
- **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
