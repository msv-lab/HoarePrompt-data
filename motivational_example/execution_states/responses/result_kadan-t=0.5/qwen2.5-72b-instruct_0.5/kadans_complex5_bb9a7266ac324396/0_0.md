The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the logic that updates `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Original Issue**: The original code only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element.
- **Fix**: By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found, regardless of its position in the list.

### Example:
For the input `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function will correctly return `6` (the product of the sublist `[2, 3]`).

For the input `xs = [-2, 0, -1]`, the function will correctly return `0` (since the maximum product of any non-empty sublist is `0`).

This ensures that the function works correctly for all possible inputs.
