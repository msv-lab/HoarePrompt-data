The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze whether the function correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis of the Function

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

The function correctly handles the following cases:
- **Positive Numbers**: It finds the maximum product of positive numbers.
- **Negative Numbers**: It correctly handles the case where the product of two negative numbers can become positive and potentially larger than other products.
- **Zero**: If the list contains zero, it will reset the product calculation, ensuring that the maximum product is not affected by zero.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element as the maximum product.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, and correctly updates the maximum product found so far.

Thus, the solution is correct and effective for the given problem.
