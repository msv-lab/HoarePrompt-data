The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic to see if it effectively solves the problem.

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is appropriate since there are no subarrays to consider.
  - If the list contains only one element, the function correctly returns that element.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to ensure the function works as expected:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First Iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
   - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`

3. **Second Iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6`

4. **Third Iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6`

The function correctly returns `6`, which is the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in a given list of integers. It handles edge cases and negative numbers appropriately. Therefore, the solution is valid and effective.
