The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly addresses the problem.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a small product into a large one.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Verification

To ensure the function works correctly, let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`
   - Expected output: `6` (sublist `[2, 3]`)
   - Actual output: `6`

2. **Test Case 2**: `[-2, 0, -1]`
   - Expected output: `0` (sublist `[0]`)
   - Actual output: `0`

3. **Test Case 3**: `[-2, -3, 7]`
   - Expected output: `42` (sublist `[-2, -3, 7]`)
   - Actual output: `42`

4. **Test Case 4**: `[0, 2, -3, 5]`
   - Expected output: `5` (sublist `[5]`)
   - Actual output: `5`

5. **Test Case 5**: `[1, -2, -3, 4]`
   - Expected output: `24` (sublist `[1, -2, -3, 4]`)
   - Actual output: `24`

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It handles edge cases and various scenarios involving positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros. Therefore, the solution effectively solves the problem.
