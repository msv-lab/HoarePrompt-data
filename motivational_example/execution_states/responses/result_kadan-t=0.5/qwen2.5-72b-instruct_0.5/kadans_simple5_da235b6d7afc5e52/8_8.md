The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the solution to understand how it works and whether it correctly addresses the problem.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`):
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
   - This step ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, as a negative product can become positive when multiplied by another negative number.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the edge case of an empty list by returning negative infinity.
- **Sublist Consideration**: The function considers all possible sublists by iterating through the list and updating the maximum and minimum products dynamically.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and effectively solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. It handles various edge cases and ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, making it a robust solution.
