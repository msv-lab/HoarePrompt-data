The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's analyze the code to see if it correctly addresses the problem.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

The solution is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: By maintaining both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the algorithm can handle cases where the product of two negative numbers becomes positive.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles empty lists by returning `-inf`, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the list, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with a few test cases:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 12 (sublist [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 5]))  # Expected output: 5 (sublist [5])
```

### Conclusion

The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles various edge cases and efficiently computes the result.
