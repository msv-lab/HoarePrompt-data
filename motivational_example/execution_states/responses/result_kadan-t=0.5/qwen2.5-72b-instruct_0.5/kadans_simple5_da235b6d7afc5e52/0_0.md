The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down how it works and why it solves the problem:

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, which is crucial because a negative product can become positive when multiplied by another negative number.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness
- The function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).
- It efficiently computes the maximum product by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step, which is necessary to handle negative numbers properly.

### Example
Let's consider an example to verify the correctness:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
```

In this example:
- The maximum product of any sublist is 6, which is the product of the sublist `[2, 3]`.

### Conclusion
The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It efficiently handles various cases, including negative numbers and empty lists.
