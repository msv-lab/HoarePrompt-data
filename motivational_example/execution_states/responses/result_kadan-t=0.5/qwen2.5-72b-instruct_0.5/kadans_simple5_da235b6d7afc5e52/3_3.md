The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down how it works and why it solves the problem:

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is important because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (since the first element is already considered in the initialization):
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.
     - If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the list, return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness of the Solution

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products at each step. This ensures that a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list, making it efficient for large lists.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to see how the function works:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First Iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
   - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`

3. **Second Iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6`

4. **Third Iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6`

5. **Final Result**:
   - The function returns `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. It efficiently handles various edge cases, including negative numbers and empty lists.
