The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is important because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Handling Positive Numbers**: The algorithm correctly updates the maximum product when encountering positive numbers.
- **Overall Maximum Product**: The algorithm ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, which is updated appropriately during the iteration.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The algorithm efficiently handles various edge cases, including negative numbers and empty lists, ensuring the correct result is returned.
