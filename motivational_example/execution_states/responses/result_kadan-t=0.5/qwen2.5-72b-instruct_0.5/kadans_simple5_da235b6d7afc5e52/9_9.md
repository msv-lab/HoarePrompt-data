The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling empty list**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling single-element list**: The function correctly initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element, which is the only possible product.
- **Handling multiple elements**:
  - The algorithm correctly considers both positive and negative products by maintaining both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.
  - It updates these values based on the current element and the previous products, ensuring that the maximum product is tracked accurately.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to verify the correctness:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here = 2`
   - `max_ending_here = 2`
   - `best_so_far = 2`

2. **First iteration (num = 3)**:
   - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
   - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
   - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`

3. **Second iteration (num = -2)**:
   - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
   - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
   - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6`

4. **Third iteration (num = 4)**:
   - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
   - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
   - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
   - `best_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6`

The final result is `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist `[2, 3]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. The algorithm efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and ensures that the maximum product is tracked accurately. Therefore, the solution solves the problem as described.
