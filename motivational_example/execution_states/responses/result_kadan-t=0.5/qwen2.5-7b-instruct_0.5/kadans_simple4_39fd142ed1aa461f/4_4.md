The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This is a good starting point because it helps keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position.

2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates three values:
   - `temp`: The product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This handles the case where a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
   - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This is used to handle cases where a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative product.

3. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the code with some comments added for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize min_ending_here, max_ending_here, and best_so_far with the first element
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temp as the product of the current element and the previous max_ending_here
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of the current element, temp, and the product of the current element and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of the current element, temp, and the product of the current element and min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater than best_so_far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This solution correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, including edge cases such as lists with all negative numbers or zero. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
