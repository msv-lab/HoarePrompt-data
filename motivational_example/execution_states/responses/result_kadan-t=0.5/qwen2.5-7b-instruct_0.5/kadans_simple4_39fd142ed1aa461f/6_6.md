The provided solution is mostly correct and works well for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there's a small improvement that can be made to ensure clarity and correctness in all cases. Specifically, the `min_ending_here` should be updated before updating `max_ending_here` to avoid potential issues with negative numbers.

Here is the corrected and slightly improved version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        # Store the current max_ending_here in a temporary variable
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Temporary Variable**: By storing `max_ending_here` in a temporary variable (`temp_max`), we ensure that `min_ending_here` is updated correctly even when `max_ending_here` changes.
2. **Clarity**: The code is more readable due to the separation of updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

This approach ensures that the algorithm correctly handles cases where the product of a negative number with a large negative product becomes positive and could potentially be the new maximum product.
