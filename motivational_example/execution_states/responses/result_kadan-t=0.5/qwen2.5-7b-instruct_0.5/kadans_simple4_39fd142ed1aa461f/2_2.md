The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be solving the problem correctly. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, or vice versa.

Let's break down the logic:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly, and it efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the provided code again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The solution is correct and should work for the given problem.
