The provided solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down the logic to understand why it works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), we calculate three possible products:
     - `num` itself (if the current number is positive or negative but doesn't affect the product).
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (considering the possibility that the previous maximum product could be negative and multiplying it with a negative number could result in a larger positive product).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num` (considering the possibility that the previous minimum product could be negative and multiplying it with a negative number could result in a larger positive product).

3. **Update the values**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of these three values.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of these three values.

4. **Track the best product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initialize: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
- First iteration (for `3`):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `6`.

- Second iteration (for `-2`):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 3`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - No update to `best_so_far`.

- Third iteration (for `4`):
  - `temp = 3 * 4 = 12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 12, -12 * 4) = 12`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 12, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `12`.

The final result is `12`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficient. It handles both positive and negative numbers correctly and finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time \(O(n)\).
