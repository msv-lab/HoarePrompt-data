The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be solving the problem correctly. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Let's break down the logic:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the logic:

1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
3. For each element, calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
   - `temp` is the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
     - The current element itself,
     - `temp` (the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`),
     - The product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here` (since a negative times a negative can become positive).
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
     - The current element itself,
     - `temp`,
     - The product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.
4. After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.
5. Return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the function again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The function is correct and should work as expected for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
