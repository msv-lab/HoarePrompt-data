The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be solving the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

### Problem Description:
Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the list.

### Solution Analysis:
- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
  - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

- **Iterate through the list**:
  - For each element, calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
    - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the previous subarray.
    - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
      - The current number itself (starting a new subarray).
      - Continuing the previous subarray with the current number.
      - Continuing the previous subarray with the minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
    - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
      - The current number itself (starting a new subarray).
      - Continuing the previous subarray with the current number.
      - Continuing the previous subarray with the minimum product (to handle negative numbers).

- **Update the best result**:
  - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Correctness:
This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers. It ensures that the maximum product is tracked while also considering the possibility of negative numbers turning a large negative product into a large positive one.

### Example:
Let's test the function with a few examples:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Output: 42 (subarray [-2, -3, 7])
```

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct and should work as expected for finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in a list of integers.
