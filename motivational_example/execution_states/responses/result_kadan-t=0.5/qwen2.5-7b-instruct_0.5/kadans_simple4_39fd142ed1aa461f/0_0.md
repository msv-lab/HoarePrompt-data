The provided solution is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which helps in handling cases where negative numbers are involved.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, as it will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far` as the result.

This approach ensures that the algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. Here is the code again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

The solution is correct and efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input list.
