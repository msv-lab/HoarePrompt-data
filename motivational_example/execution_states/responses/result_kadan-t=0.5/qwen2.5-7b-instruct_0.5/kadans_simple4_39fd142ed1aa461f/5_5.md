The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), we calculate three possible products:
     - The current number itself (`num`).
     - The product of the current number and `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
     - The product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.
   - We then update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on these three possibilities:
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the three values.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the three values.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After processing each element, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Test Cases

Let's test the function with some example cases to verify its correctness:

```python
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6  # Sublist [2, 3] has the maximum product 6
    assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0    # Sublist [0] has the maximum product 0
    assert func_1([-2, 3, -4]) == 24   # Sublist [-2, 3, -4] has the maximum product 24
    assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == 24  # Sublist [-1, -2, -3, -4] has the maximum product 24
    assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')  # Empty list returns negative infinity
    assert func_1([0, 0, 0]) == 0       # List with all zeros returns 0

test_func_1()
```

Running the above test cases should confirm that the function works as expected.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and should work for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.
