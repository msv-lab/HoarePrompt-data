The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step:

### Problem Description:
Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist).

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` because no product can be calculated from an empty list.
2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by another negative number can become positive.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.
3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element itself,
       - `temp` (which is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element),
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current element itself,
       - `temp`,
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.
5. **Return Result**:
   - Return `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It ensures that the minimum product is tracked to handle cases where a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- The `best_so_far` variable is updated only when a new maximum product is found.

### Example Execution:
Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
- After processing `3`:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `-2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `4`:
  - `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = 24`

Thus, the final result is `24`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct and should work for any list of integers.
