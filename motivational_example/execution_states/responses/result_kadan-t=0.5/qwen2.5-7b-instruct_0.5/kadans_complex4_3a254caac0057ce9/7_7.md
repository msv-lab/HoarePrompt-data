The provided solution is mostly correct but has some issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` can be simplified and corrected. Here's a revised version of the function with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Update min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp_max` as the maximum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Calculate `temp_min` as the minimum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to `temp_max`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to `temp_min`.
     - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, which is crucial for finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correct Execution States:

- **Empty List**: Returns `-inf`.
- **Non-empty List**: Finds the maximum product of any sublist.

This solution should work correctly for all test cases.
