The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current number (`num`).
       - `temp` (product of `max_ending_here` and `num`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current number (`num`).
       - `temp` (product of `max_ending_here` and `num`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After processing all elements, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Verification:
- The algorithm correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, as it uses both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to account for the possibility that a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- The initialization and updates ensure that the algorithm considers all possible sublists ending at each position.

### Example Test Cases:
Let's test the function with some example inputs to ensure it works as expected:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far

# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (from [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (from [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (from [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```

Running these test cases should confirm the correctness of the solution.
