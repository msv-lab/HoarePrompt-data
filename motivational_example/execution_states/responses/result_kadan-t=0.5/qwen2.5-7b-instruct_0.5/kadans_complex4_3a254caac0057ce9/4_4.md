The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few issues that need addressing. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` can be improved. Here's a corrected version of the code with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temporary values
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # Return the best product found
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are set to the first element of the list. This is correct because the product of any single-element sublist is the element itself.

2. **Temporary Values**: Instead of recalculating `temp` twice, we calculate both `temp_max` and `temp_min` in one step. This simplifies the logic and avoids redundancy.

3. **Update Logic**: The `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated using the calculated `temp_max` and `temp_min`. This ensures that we correctly track the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at each position.

4. **Best So Far**: The `best_so_far` is updated only when `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the algorithm correctly handles cases where negative numbers are present in the list, which can lead to larger products when multiplied with subsequent negative numbers.

### Example Execution:
For example, given the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initial state: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- After processing `3`: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `-2`: `min_ending_here = -12`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `4`: `min_ending_here = -48`, `max_ending_here = 24`, `best_so_far = 24`

Thus, the function returns `24`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

This solution should work correctly for all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros.
