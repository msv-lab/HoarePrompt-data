The provided solution seems mostly correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` can be simplified and corrected. Here's the revised version of the function with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Update the values based on the current number
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # Update the best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are set to the first element of the list, which is correct.
2. **Update Logic**:
   - Instead of using a temporary variable `temp` for both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we use separate temporary variables `temp_max` and `temp_min` to store the potential new maximum and minimum products.
   - This simplifies the logic and makes it easier to understand.
3. **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**:
   - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

### Correct Execution States:
- **Empty List**: If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.
- **Non-empty List**: For a non-empty list, the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist by maintaining the minimum and maximum products ending at each position.

This revised solution should work correctly for all test cases.
