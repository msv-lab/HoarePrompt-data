The given program appears to be correct. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative numbers.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This helps in handling cases where a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

3. **Update the best result**: After updating `max_ending_here`, it is checked against `best_so_far` and updated if necessary.

4. **Return the best result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach effectively handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is found correctly even when the list contains negative numbers. Therefore, the given solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
