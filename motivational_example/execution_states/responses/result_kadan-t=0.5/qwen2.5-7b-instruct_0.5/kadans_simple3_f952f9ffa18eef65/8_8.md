Let's analyze the provided solution to determine its correctness.

The problem is to find the maximum product of any sublist from a given integer list. The provided solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here is the provided code with some comments for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Handle empty list case

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]  # Initialize best_so_far with the first element

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary value to consider the current number alone
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of:
        # - the current number itself,
        # - the product of max_ending_here and the current number,
        # - the product of min_ending_here and the current number.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of:
        # - the current number itself,
        # - the product of max_ending_here and the current number,
        # - the product of min_ending_here and the current number.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # Update best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the algorithm updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current element and the previous values.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After processing all elements, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for the possibility of turning a negative product into a positive one.
- The final result is stored in `best_so_far`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct. It effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.

**Correctness: True**
