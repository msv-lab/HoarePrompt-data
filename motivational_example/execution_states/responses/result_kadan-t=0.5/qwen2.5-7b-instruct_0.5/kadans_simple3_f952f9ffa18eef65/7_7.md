The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum product that can be obtained ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.
- For each number in the list, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
- This approach ensures that even if there are negative numbers in the list, the algorithm can still find the maximum product by switching between the minimum and maximum products when encountering a negative number.

Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
