The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The logic used in the function `func_1` is based on keeping track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of the subarray that ends at the current position.
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of the subarray that ends at the current position.
- `best_so_far` stores the overall maximum product found so far.

This approach ensures that even if there are negative numbers in the list, the algorithm can still find the maximum product correctly by considering the effect of multiplying by a negative number.

Let's test the function with some examples to ensure its correctness:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))     # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))     # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0])) # Expected output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2])
```

Based on the problem description and the provided solution, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
