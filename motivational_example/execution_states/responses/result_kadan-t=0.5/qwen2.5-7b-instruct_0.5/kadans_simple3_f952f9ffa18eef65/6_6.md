The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the code calculates three values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`

3. **Updating the best product**:
   - After processing each number, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

This approach works because it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is crucial when dealing with negative numbers, as a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here is a brief explanation of how it handles different scenarios:
- If the current number is negative, it can turn a large negative product into a large positive product (if multiplied by `min_ending_here`).
- If the current number is positive, it can extend the existing maximum product.
- If the current number is zero, it resets both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to the current number (since multiplying by zero results in zero).

Given this analysis, the solution should correctly handle all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
