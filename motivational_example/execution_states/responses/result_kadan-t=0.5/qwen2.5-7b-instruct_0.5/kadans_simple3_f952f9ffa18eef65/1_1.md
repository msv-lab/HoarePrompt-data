The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

The logic inside the loop updates these variables based on the current element and the products calculated from the previous elements. This ensures that the algorithm considers both positive and negative numbers correctly.

Here is the solution again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

So, the answer is: **True**
