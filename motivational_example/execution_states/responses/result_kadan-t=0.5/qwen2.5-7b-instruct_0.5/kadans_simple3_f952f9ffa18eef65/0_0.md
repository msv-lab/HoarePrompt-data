The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The logic implemented in `func_1` is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers, which is essential for correctly calculating the maximum product.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` stores the overall maximum product found so far.

For each number in the list:
- We calculate the temporary product (`temp`) of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
- We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
  - The current number itself,
  - The temporary product (`temp`),
  - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (since multiplying a negative number with another negative can result in a large positive number).
- Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
  - The current number itself,
  - The temporary product (`temp`),
  - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (to handle cases where the current number is negative and could flip the sign).

Finally, we update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

Given this explanation, the provided solution should work correctly for the problem described.

**Correctness: True**
