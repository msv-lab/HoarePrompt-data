The given program appears to be correct based on the provided annotations. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is a well-known approach to solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the code calculates three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
   - These calculations ensure that both the maximum and minimum products are tracked, considering the possibility of negative numbers turning a large negative product into a large positive one.

3. **Updating the best product**:
   - After iterating through all elements, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Edge case handling**:
   - If the input list is empty (`not xs`), the function correctly returns `-inf`.

Based on these points and the provided annotations, the solution is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
