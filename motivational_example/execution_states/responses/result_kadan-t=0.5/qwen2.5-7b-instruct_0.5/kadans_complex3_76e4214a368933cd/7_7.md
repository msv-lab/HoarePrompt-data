The given program is **Correct**.

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is based on the Kadane's algorithm adapted for finding the maximum product instead of the maximum sum.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is computed as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the best product**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that even when encountering negative numbers, the algorithm can still find the maximum product by considering both positive and negative products.

### Example Execution States:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- **After first iteration (num = 3)**:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- **After second iteration (num = -2)**:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- **After third iteration (num = 4)**:
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - `best_so_far = 4`

- **Final Return**:
  - `best_so_far = 4`

Thus, the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist, and the provided solution is **correct**.
