The given program is correct. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is a well-known algorithm for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists that end at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the algorithm calculates three values:
     - `temp`: the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - `max_ending_here`: the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
     - `min_ending_here`: the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - These calculations ensure that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position, considering both positive and negative numbers.

3. **Updating the best result**:
   - After processing each element, the algorithm checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Returning the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
