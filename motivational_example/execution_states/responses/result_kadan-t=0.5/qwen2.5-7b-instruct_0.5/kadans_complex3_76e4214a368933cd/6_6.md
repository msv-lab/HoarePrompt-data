The given program appears to be correct based on the provided description and the states described in the comments. The algorithm used is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the best result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that even if there are negative numbers in the list, the minimum product can turn into a maximum product when multiplied by another negative number, thus correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist.

Given this analysis, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
