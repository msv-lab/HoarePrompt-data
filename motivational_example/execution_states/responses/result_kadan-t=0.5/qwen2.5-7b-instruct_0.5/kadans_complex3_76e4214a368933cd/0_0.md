The given program is correct. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is a well-known approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list because these variables track the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element because initially, the best product found so far is the first element itself.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This considers extending the current maximum product sublist.
     - `num`: This considers starting a new sublist from the current element.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This considers extending the current minimum product sublist.
   - The `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of these three values, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of these three values, ensuring that it always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.

3. **Update Best Product**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns `float('-inf')`.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
