The given program is correct. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is a well-known algorithm for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, representing the best product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates three values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is the product of the current maximum ending here and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that even if there are negative numbers in the list, the algorithm can still find the maximum product by considering both positive and negative products at each step.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
