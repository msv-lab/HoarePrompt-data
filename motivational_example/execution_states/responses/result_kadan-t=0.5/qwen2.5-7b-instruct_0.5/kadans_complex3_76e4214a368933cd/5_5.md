The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated states. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After the loop, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return `best_so_far`**:
   - Return the value of `best_so_far`, which will be the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly because it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This way, if a negative number turns a large negative product into a large positive product, it can still be considered.

Given this analysis, the solution appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
