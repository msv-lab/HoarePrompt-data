The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few issues that need to be addressed. Let's go through the code step-by-step and identify the problems.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `min_ending_here`:**
   - The initial value of `min_ending_here` should be set to 1 instead of `xs[0]`. This is because when you multiply a negative number with a very small positive number, it can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling of Negative Numbers:**
   - The logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` needs to be corrected. Specifically, the current logic does not handle the case where the product of `min_ending_here` and `num` could become the new `max_ending_here`.

3. **Final Return Value:**
   - The final return value should be `best_so_far`, which keeps track of the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = 1
    max_ending_here = 1
    best_so_far = float('-inf')
    
    for num in xs:
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Initialization:**
  - `min_ending_here` is initialized to 1 to handle cases where the product of two negative numbers becomes positive.
  - `max_ending_here` is also initialized to 1 for the same reason.

- **Loop Through List:**
  - For each number in the list, we calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
  - `temp_max` is the maximum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `temp_min` is the minimum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  
- **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:**
  - Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` using the values of `temp_max` and `temp_min`.

- **Track Best So Far:**
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

- **Return Result:**
  - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
