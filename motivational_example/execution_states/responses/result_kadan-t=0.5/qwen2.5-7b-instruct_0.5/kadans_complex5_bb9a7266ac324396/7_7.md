The provided solution appears to be mostly correct, but there are a few areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness. Specifically, the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` can be simplified and made more robust. Here's a revised version of the code with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temporary values
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        # Update best_so_far if current max_ending_here is better
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list. This ensures that we start with a valid initial state.

2. **Temporary Values**:
   - Instead of calculating `temp` and then using it to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we directly compute `temp_max` and `temp_min` in one step. This simplifies the logic and makes it easier to follow.

3. **Update Logic**:
   - We update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` in a single line, which makes the code more concise and easier to understand.
   - We then check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Execution States:
- **State: xs is a list of integers.**
- **State: xs is not empty.**
- **State: `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element.**
- **State: `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element.**
- **State: `best_so_far` keeps track of the best product found so far.**

This version of the code should correctly handle edge cases and provide the expected results.
