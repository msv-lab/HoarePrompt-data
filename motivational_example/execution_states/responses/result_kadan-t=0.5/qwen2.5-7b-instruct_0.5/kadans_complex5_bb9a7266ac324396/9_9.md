The provided solution is mostly correct but has some logical issues that need to be addressed. Let's go through the code step-by-step to identify and correct these issues.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `min_ending_here`:**
   - The initial value of `min_ending_here` should be set to 1 instead of `xs[0]`. This is because we need to handle cases where the current number is negative and could potentially make the previous maximum product become the minimum product.

2. **Logic for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:**
   - The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` needs to be corrected. Specifically, the comparison logic should be simplified to avoid unnecessary conditions.

3. **Final Return Value:**
   - The final return value should be `best_so_far`, which keeps track of the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = 1
    max_ending_here = 1
    best_so_far = float('-inf')

    for num in xs:
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here = 1` ensures that even if the current number is negative, it can still multiply with the previous minimum to get a new potential maximum.
   
2. **Update Logic:**
   - The update logic for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is simplified to use temporary variables (`temp_max` and `temp_min`) to avoid nested comparisons.

3. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Example Execution:
Let's consider an example to verify the correctness of the function:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output should be 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Output should be 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
```

The corrected function should now work as expected for various test cases.
