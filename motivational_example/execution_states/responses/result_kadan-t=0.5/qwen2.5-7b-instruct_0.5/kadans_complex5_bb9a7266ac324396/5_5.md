The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few issues that need addressing. Let's go through the code step-by-step and identify the problems.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Initialization of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`:**
   - The initial values for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` should be set to `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` respectively, to handle cases where the list contains negative numbers.

2. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - The update of `best_so_far` should happen inside the loop, not after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found during the iteration.

3. **Return Statement:**
   - The return statement should be outside the loop to ensure that the final `best_so_far` value is returned.

### Corrected Solution

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = float('-inf')
    max_ending_here = float('inf')
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs:
        # State: num is the current element being processed
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here and max_ending_here
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        
        # State: `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element
        # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist in xs
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Initialization:**
  - `min_ending_here` is initialized to `float('-inf')` to handle negative numbers.
  - `max_ending_here` is initialized to `float('inf')` to ensure it can be updated to a smaller value.
  - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list.

- **Loop:**
  - For each element `num` in the list, we calculate `temp_max` and `temp_min` based on the current `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
  - We update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` accordingly.
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, we update `best_so_far`.

- **Return Statement:**
  - After the loop, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any sublist, and it is returned.

This corrected solution should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
