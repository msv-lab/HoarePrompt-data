The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify each part of the code.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initial Checks**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`-inf`). This is a valid way to handle the edge case where no products can be computed.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Here, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list, and `best_so_far` is also set to the first element. These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, and the best product found so far, respectively.

3. **Iterate through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number could turn into a positive product if multiplied by another negative number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is necessary because even a large positive product can become very small when multiplied by a negative number.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example list `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initial state:
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- Iteration 1 (for `num = 3`):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - Update `best_so_far` to 6

- Iteration 2 (for `num = -2`):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - No update to `best_so_far`

- Iteration 3 (for `num = 4`):
  - `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`
  - Update `best_so_far` to 24

The final result is `24`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately. The logic ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is found efficiently.
