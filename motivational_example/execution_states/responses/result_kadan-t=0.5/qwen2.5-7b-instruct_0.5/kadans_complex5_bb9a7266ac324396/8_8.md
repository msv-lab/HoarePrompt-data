The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few issues that need addressing. Let's go through the code step-by-step and identify the problems.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:**
   - The initial value of `best_so_far` should be set to `float('-inf')` to handle cases where all numbers in the list are negative.

2. **Logic for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:**
   - The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` needs to be corrected. Specifically, the current logic does not correctly handle the case when `num` itself is negative and could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Final Return Value:**
   - The final return value should be `best_so_far`, which is correctly initialized and updated during the loop.

### Corrected Solution

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: num is the next element in xs
        temp_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        temp_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)

        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min

        # State: `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at the current element
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are both initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, but it should be set to `float('-inf')` initially to handle cases where all elements are negative.

2. **Loop Through List:**
   - For each element `num` in the list, we calculate two temporary values: `temp_max` and `temp_min`.
   - `temp_max` is the maximum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `temp_min` is the minimum of `num`, `max_ending_here * num`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:**
   - Update `max_ending_here` to `temp_max` and `min_ending_here` to `temp_min`.

4. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return `best_so_far`:**
   - After the loop, return `best_so_far`, which will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected solution should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
