Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which helps handle cases where negative numbers are involved. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates three values:
     - `temp`: the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here`: the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here`: the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Update**:
   - After processing each element, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
