Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The approach used is efficient and handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning `-inf`.

Here's a brief explanation of why the function works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list. This ensures that the algorithm starts with the correct base case.

2. **Iterating through the list**: For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates the potential new maximum and minimum products that can be formed by including the current element. This is done using the variables `temp`, `max_ending_here`, and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating the best product**: After processing each element, the function updates `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Handling negative numbers**: The key insight here is that multiplying a negative number with the current `max_ending_here` (which could be positive) might yield a larger product than the current `max_ending_here`, and similarly, multiplying a negative number with the current `min_ending_here` (which could be negative) might yield a smaller product than the current `min_ending_here`. This allows the algorithm to handle cases where negative numbers can lead to unexpectedly large products.

5. **Edge case handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct.
