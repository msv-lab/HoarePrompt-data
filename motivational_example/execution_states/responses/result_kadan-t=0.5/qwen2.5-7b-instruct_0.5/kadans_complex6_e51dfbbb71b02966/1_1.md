Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a brief explanation of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates three values:
     - `temp`: the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here`: the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
     - `min_ending_here`: the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update**:
   - After processing each element, the `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that the maximum product is found even when there are negative numbers in the list, as it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
