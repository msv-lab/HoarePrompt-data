Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position and the overall best product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the function updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` based on the current element and the previous values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Update the best product**: After updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return the result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This approach effectively handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, ensuring that the maximum product is correctly identified. The provided comments accurately describe the state of the variables and the logic at different stages of the function execution. Therefore, the solution is correct.
