Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position and the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the function calculates the temporary product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`). It then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly.

3. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach effectively handles edge cases such as lists containing only one element, lists with all negative numbers, and lists with zero. The provided comments also correctly describe the state of the program at various points, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
