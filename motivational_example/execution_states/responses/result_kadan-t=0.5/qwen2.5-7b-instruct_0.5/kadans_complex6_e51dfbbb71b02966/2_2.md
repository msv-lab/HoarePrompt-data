Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is based on the Kadane's algorithm variant that can handle both positive and negative numbers effectively by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why the function works:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

During each iteration, the function updates these variables based on the current element and the previous state of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that the function can handle cases where the product of the current element and the minimum product (which could be negative) results in a larger positive product.

The initial checks and conditions ensure that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning `-inf`.

Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
