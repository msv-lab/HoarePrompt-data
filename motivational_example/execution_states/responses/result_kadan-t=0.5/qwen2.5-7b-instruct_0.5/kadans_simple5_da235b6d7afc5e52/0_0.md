Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation

The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of two values at each step:
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of a sublist ending at the current element.
- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of a sublist ending at the current element.

This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product (and vice versa).

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the function calculates three potential products:
     - `num`: The product of the current element alone.
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: The product of the current element with the previous maximum product.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: The product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
   
   - The new `max_ending_here` is the maximum of these three values. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number could turn a small negative product into a large positive product.
   
   - Similarly, the new `min_ending_here` is the minimum of these three values. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number could turn a large positive product into a large negative product.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Example

Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initialize: 
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- First iteration (for `3`):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `6`

- Second iteration (for `-2`):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - No update to `best_so_far`

- Third iteration (for `4`):
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `4`

The final result is `4`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

Therefore, the provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist.
