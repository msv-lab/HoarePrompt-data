The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`num in xs[1:]`), the following steps are performed:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: 
       - The current number (`num`).
       - The temporary value (`temp`), which is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`).
       - The temporary value (`temp`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Update the best product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example

Let's consider an example to verify the correctness of the function:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output should be 6, because the maximum product is from the sublist [2, 3]
```

In this example:
- The sublist `[2, 3]` has a product of `6`, which is the maximum product.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively, ensuring that the maximum product is found even when negative numbers are involved. Therefore, the solution provided does indeed solve the problem.
