The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`for num in xs[1:]`) and iterates through each element.
   - For each element, we calculate three potential products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents continuing the previous maximum product.
     - `num`: This represents starting a new subarray with the current element.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This represents continuing the previous minimum product (since multiplying a negative number can turn it into a positive one).
   - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of these three values. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example

Let's consider an example list: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, and `best_so_far = 2`.
- For `num = 3`:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `6`.
- For `num = -2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
- For `num = 4`:
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - Update `best_so_far` to `4`.

The final value of `best_so_far` is `6`, which is the correct maximum product of any sublist in the given list.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively, ensuring that the algorithm works as intended.
