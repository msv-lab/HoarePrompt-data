The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates three values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the current sequence.
     - `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of continuing the current sequence or starting a new sequence.
     - `min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of continuing the current sequence or starting a new sequence.

3. **Update the best product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example

Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initially: 
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- Iteration 1 (num = 3):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`

- Iteration 2 (num = -2):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 3`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, 3) = 6`

- Iteration 3 (num = 4):
  - `temp = 3 * 4 = 12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 12, -12 * 4) = 12`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 12, -12 * 4) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, 12) = 12`

The final result is `12`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively and ensures that the maximum product is updated appropriately.
