The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the function calculates three potential values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the current sequence.
     - `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of continuing the sequence or starting a new one.
     - `min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of continuing the sequence or starting a new one.

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example

Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initialize: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- First iteration (num = 3):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - Update `best_so_far` to 6
- Second iteration (num = -2):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
- Third iteration (num = 4):
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - Update `best_so_far` to 6 (unchanged)

The final result is `6`, which is the correct maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively and ensures that the maximum product is tracked throughout the iteration.
