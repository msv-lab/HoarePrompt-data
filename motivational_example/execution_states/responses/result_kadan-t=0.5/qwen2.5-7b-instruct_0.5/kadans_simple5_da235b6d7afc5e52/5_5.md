The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. It is initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position. It is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far`: This variable stores the best (maximum) product found so far. It is initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the following logic:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This calculates the potential new maximum product if we continue the current sequence.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the potential new maximum product, or the minimum product multiplied by the current number. The last term (`min_ending_here * num`) is important because it can turn a small negative number into a large positive number.
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the potential new minimum product, or the minimum product multiplied by the current number. Again, this helps in handling cases where a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative one.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if it is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Usage

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Output: 42
```

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros. Therefore, the solution provided does indeed solve the given problem.
