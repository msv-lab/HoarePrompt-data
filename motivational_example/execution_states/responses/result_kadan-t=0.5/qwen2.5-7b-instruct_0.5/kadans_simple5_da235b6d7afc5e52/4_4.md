Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` does solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`). This handles the case where a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large negative product or vice versa.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`). This ensures that even if the product becomes very large due to a positive number, the minimum product is still tracked.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Usage

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output should be 6 (from the sublist [2, 3])
```

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list.
- **List with All Negative Numbers**: The function will correctly handle this case by tracking the minimum product, which will eventually become the maximum when multiplied by another negative number.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the list.
