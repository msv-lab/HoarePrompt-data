The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element (`num`).
   - For each element, it calculates three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents extending the current maximum product ending here.
     - `min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This represents the minimum product ending here, considering the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a large positive product into a large negative one.
     - `max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This represents the maximum product ending here, considering all possibilities.

3. **Update**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the three calculated values.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the three calculated values.
   - If the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - After iterating through the entire list, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initially: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- After processing `3`: `min_ending_here = 6`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `-2`: `min_ending_here = -12`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After processing `4`: `min_ending_here = -48`, `max_ending_here = 24`, `best_so_far = 24`

Thus, the function correctly identifies that the maximum product of any sublist is `24`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
