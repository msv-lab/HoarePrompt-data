Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through each element starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element, we calculate three potential products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the previous sequence.
     - `num`: This represents the product if we start a new sequence with the current number.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we extend the previous minimum sequence (since multiplying a negative number can turn it into a positive one).

3. **Update**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of these three values. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the highest possible product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of these three values. This is important because even if the current number is positive, it could potentially turn a large negative product into a large positive one.

4. **Track Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

5. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach effectively handles both positive and negative numbers, including cases where there are multiple negative numbers in the list. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, making it efficient.
