Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is correct and follows a dynamic programming approach to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, as it will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the current sequence.
     - `num`: This represents starting a new sequence with the current number.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This represents extending the current minimum sequence (which can become the new maximum if multiplied by a negative number).

3. **Update variables**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the three calculated values.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the three calculated values.

4. **Track the best result**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, then `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

5. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, as it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This ensures that even if a negative number turns a large negative product into a large positive product, it will be captured.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
