Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

The goal is to find the maximum product of any sublist from the given integer list `xs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through the List:**
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program is based on the idea that at each step, we keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product (and vice versa).

- **Handling Negative Numbers:** The program correctly handles the case where a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
- **Edge Cases:** The program correctly handles empty lists by returning `-inf`.

### Test Cases

To further validate the correctness, let's consider some test cases:

1. **Empty List:**
   ```python
   xs = []
   assert func_1(xs) == float('-inf')
   ```

2. **Single Element List:**
   ```python
   xs = [5]
   assert func_1(xs) == 5
   ```

3. **List with Positive Numbers:**
   ```python
   xs = [2, 3, 4]
   assert func_1(xs) == 24
   ```

4. **List with Negative Numbers:**
   ```python
   xs = [-2, -3, 4]
   assert func_1(xs) == 24
   ```

5. **List with Both Positive and Negative Numbers:**
   ```python
   xs = [2, -3, 4, -1, -2]
   assert func_1(xs) == 8
   ```

6. **List with Zeros:**
   ```python
   xs = [0, 2, 3, -2, 4]
   assert func_1(xs) == 24
   ```

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and considering various test cases, the program appears to be correct in finding the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True**
