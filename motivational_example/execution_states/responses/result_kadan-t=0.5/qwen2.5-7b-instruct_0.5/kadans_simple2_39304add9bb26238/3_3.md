Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is correct and follows the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`for num in xs[1:]`), the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp` (product of `max_ending_here` and the current number), and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is checked against `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly, as the product of two negative numbers can result in a positive number, potentially becoming the new maximum product. The function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.
