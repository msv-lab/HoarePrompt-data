Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the following operations are performed:
     - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

### Correctness Check

The logic used in the program is based on the idea that at each step, we keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position. This is because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The program correctly handles negative numbers by maintaining both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This ensures that if there is a sequence of negative numbers, it can still find the maximum product.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists (returning `-inf`) and lists with only one element (returning that element).

### Conclusion

The given program appears to be correct and follows the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
