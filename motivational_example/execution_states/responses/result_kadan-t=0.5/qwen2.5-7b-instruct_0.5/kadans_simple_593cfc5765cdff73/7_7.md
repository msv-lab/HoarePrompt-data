Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Explanation of the Program

The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers (`xs`). The approach used here is a dynamic programming technique where we keep track of two values at each step:
- `max_ending_here`: the maximum product of the subarray ending at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: the minimum product of the subarray ending at the current position.

This is because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. By maintaining both the maximum and minimum products, we can handle this scenario effectively.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), we calculate three potential new values for `max_ending_here`:
     - The current element itself.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - We choose the maximum of these three values as the new `max_ending_here`.
   - Similarly, we calculate three potential new values for `min_ending_here`:
     - The current element itself.
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - We choose the minimum of these three values as the new `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update**:
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, we update `best_so_far` with the value of `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Reasoning

The logic described above correctly handles the problem. It ensures that even when encountering negative numbers, the algorithm can still find the maximum product by considering both the maximum and minimum products up to the current point.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
