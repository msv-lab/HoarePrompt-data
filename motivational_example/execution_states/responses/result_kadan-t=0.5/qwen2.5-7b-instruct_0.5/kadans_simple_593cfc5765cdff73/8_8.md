Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given list of integers.

### Given Program
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Reasoning
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the program calculates three values:
     - `temp`: The product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After processing all elements, the program updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Analysis
- The logic used in the program is based on the idea that the maximum product of a subarray can be influenced by both positive and negative numbers. This is because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which can potentially become the new maximum product.
- The use of `min_ending_here` helps in tracking the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial when a negative number is encountered, as it can turn into a large positive product.
- The program correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and updates the `best_so_far` variable appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
