Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step is crucial for handling negative numbers, which can turn large negative products into large positive products.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

### Reasoning:

- The logic used in the program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist. It effectively handles both positive and negative numbers by maintaining both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
- The initialization of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list is appropriate because the initial state of the product is the first element itself.
- The loop iterates through the list, updating the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values correctly, ensuring that the maximum product is found even when the list contains negative numbers.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
