Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`. This is a good starting point because it allows us to handle the case where the entire list is negative (since the product of two negatives can be positive).

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, we calculate three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents continuing the current sequence of products.
     - `num`: This represents starting a new sequence with just the current element.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This represents extending the current minimum sequence (which could turn into a maximum if multiplied by a negative number).
   - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of these three values. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`.
   - It also correctly handles cases where all numbers are negative by maintaining the logic to track both the maximum and minimum products.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. It efficiently updates the maximum and minimum products at each step, ensuring that the final result is the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness:

**True**
