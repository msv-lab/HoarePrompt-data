Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`. This is a good start because the initial state of the product can be the first element itself.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, three potential products are considered:
     - The current number (`num`).
     - The product of the current number and `max_ending_here` (which keeps track of the maximum product ending at the previous position).
     - The product of the current number and `min_ending_here` (which keeps track of the minimum product ending at the previous position).

3. **Updating Variables**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of these three values. This ensures that we always have the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of these three values. This is crucial because a negative number multiplied by a very small positive number can result in a large negative product, which might become the new maximum product if another negative number is encountered later.

4. **Tracking the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far`. If `max_ending_here` is greater, it updates `best_so_far`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `float('-inf')`, which is correct because the product of an empty list is undefined, and `float('-inf')` represents the smallest possible value.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It efficiently keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which helps in handling cases where the product becomes negative due to the presence of negative numbers.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
