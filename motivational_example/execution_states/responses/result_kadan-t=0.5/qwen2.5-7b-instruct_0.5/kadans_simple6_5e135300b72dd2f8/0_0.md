The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`. This is a good starting point because the initial values will be used to compare against subsequent values.

2. **Iterating through the list**: For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` using the following logic:
   - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating the best result**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Returning the result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros. It efficiently computes the maximum product by keeping track of the minimum and maximum products ending at each position, which allows it to handle cases where a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
