Let's analyze the provided solution to determine its correctness.

The problem is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one and vice versa.

Here's the provided code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the list:**
   - For each element `num` in the list (starting from the second element), the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`:**
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position to account for the possibility of a negative number turning a small product into a large one.
- The final result is the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is correct. It correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.

**Correctness: True**
