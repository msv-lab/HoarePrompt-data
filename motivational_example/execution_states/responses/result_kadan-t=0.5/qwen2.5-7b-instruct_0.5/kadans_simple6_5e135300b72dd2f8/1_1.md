The provided solution is correct. Let's break down why this solution works and verify its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element (`for num in xs[1:]`), the following steps are performed:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values:
       - The current number itself (`num`).
       - The temporary value (`temp`), which represents extending the previous maximum product.
       - The product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here`). This step is crucial because it accounts for the case where a negative number can turn a previously small positive product into a large one.
     - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values:
       - The current number itself (`num`).
       - The temporary value (`temp`).
       - The product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here`).

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Execution States:

- Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.
  - Initially: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
  - After processing `3`: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`.
  - After processing `-2`: `min_ending_here = -12`, `max_ending_here = 12`, `best_so_far = 12`.
  - After processing `4`: `min_ending_here = -48`, `max_ending_here = 48`, `best_so_far = 48`.

The final result is `48`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Therefore, the solution is correct.
