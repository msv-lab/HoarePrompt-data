The provided solution appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products that can be obtained up to the current element.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.
- For each element in the list, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
- After iterating through the list, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

Given this explanation, the solution should work correctly for the described problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is: **True**.
