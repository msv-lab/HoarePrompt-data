The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates three values:
    - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
    - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
    - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`

  - These calculations ensure that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position, considering both positive and negative numbers (since a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product).

- **Update**:
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated.

- **Return**:
  - The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

Given this explanation, the provided solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
