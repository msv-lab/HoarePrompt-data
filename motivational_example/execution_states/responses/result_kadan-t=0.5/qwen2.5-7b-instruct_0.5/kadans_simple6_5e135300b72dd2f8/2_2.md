The provided solution appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
- The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.
- For each number in the list, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering three possibilities:
  - The current number alone.
  - The current number multiplied by the previous `max_ending_here`.
  - The current number multiplied by the previous `min_ending_here`.

This approach ensures that the algorithm can handle both positive and negative numbers correctly, as it considers the effect of multiplying by a negative number which can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Given this explanation, the correctness of the solution can be confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
