Let's analyze the provided solution to determine its correctness.

The problem is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The approach used in `func_1` is based on the idea that the maximum product at each step can be influenced by the current number, the product so far (max\_ending\_here), or the product considering the minimum so far (min\_ending\_here) because negative numbers can turn a large negative product into a large positive one.

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

The key steps in the loop are:
1. Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
2. Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
3. Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

This logic correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, including zeros, which can reset the product to zero.

Let's test this function with some examples:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-2, 3, -4])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0])) # Expected output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2, -3])
```

Based on the logic and the test cases, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
