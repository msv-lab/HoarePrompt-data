Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic implemented in the function is correct and follows a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf`, which is appropriate because the product of an empty list is undefined in the context of finding a maximum product.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`. This is necessary to start the iteration from the second element.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the function calculates three values:
     - `temp`: The product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative numbers, as a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This helps in tracking the smallest product, which can be useful when subsequent numbers are small and could turn a large positive product into a smaller one.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered, and the maximum product is correctly identified. Therefore, the given program is correct.
