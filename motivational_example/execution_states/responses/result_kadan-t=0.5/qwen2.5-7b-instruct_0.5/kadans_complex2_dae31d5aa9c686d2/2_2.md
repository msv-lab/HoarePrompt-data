Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` (negative infinity), which is the correct behavior since the product of an empty list is undefined but should be considered as the smallest possible value.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element, the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers because multiplying a negative number with the current `min_ending_here` can result in a larger (positive) product, which is captured by updating `max_ending_here`.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as lists containing only one element or lists with all negative numbers.
- **General Case**: For general cases, the algorithm maintains the correct state transitions for both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, ensuring that the maximum product is tracked accurately.

Given the above analysis, the provided Python function is correct and will produce the expected results for finding the maximum product of any sublist.
