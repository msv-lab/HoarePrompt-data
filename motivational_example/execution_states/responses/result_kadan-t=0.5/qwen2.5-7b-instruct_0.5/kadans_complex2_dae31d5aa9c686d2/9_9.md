Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Setup:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf`. This is correct because an empty list should not have a product, and returning `-inf` makes sense in this context.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Here, we initialize three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` to store the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   For each element in the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
     - The current number `num`.
     - `temp` (product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number).
     - The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
     - The current number `num`.
     - `temp`.
     - The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   After the loop, we check if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`. Finally, we return `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification

The logic in the program is designed to handle both positive and negative numbers correctly. The key idea is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

For example, consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
- After processing `3`: 
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
- After processing `-2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
- After processing `4`:
  - `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`

In the end, `best_so_far` will be `24`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list of integers. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
