Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This part correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. In this case, it returns `-inf` because there are no elements to form a product.

2. **Initialization of Variables:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number `num`, the temporary product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number `num`, the temporary product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop, the final `max_ending_here` is compared with `best_so_far`, and `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   The function returns the maximum product found.

### Correctness Verification

The logic in the program is sound and follows the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist. The use of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the program can handle cases where the product of a sublist might become negative due to the presence of negative numbers.

### Conclusion

The given Python program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
