Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Setup:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function correctly returns `-inf` (negative infinity).

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the list contains only one element, the function correctly returns that element.
  - If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

- **Behavior with Negative Numbers:**
  - The logic handles negative numbers correctly because it considers both the maximum and minimum products at each step, ensuring that the minimum product can become the new maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

- **Overall Logic:**
  - The algorithm correctly maintains the maximum product of any sublist by considering the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.

### Conclusion

The given Python program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
