Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity), which is the correct behavior since no product can be calculated from an empty list.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists that end at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the program calculates three potential values:
     - `temp`: The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
     - The new `max_ending_here` is determined as the maximum of:
       - The current number itself.
       - `temp` (the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
     - The new `min_ending_here` is determined as the minimum of:
       - The current number itself.
       - `temp`.
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   
4. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After processing each element, the program checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, and efficiently computes the maximum product using dynamic programming principles. Therefore, the given program is correct.
