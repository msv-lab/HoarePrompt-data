Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic step by step to verify its correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `float('-inf')`. This ensures that if there are no elements in the list, the function returns a value indicating that no valid product can be found.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is a good starting point because it allows us to consider the first element as both the minimum and maximum product ending at that point.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on three possible products:
     - The current number itself (`num`).
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`max_ending_here * num`).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

4. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The logic correctly handles negative numbers by considering the product of `min_ending_here` and `num` when updating `max_ending_here`. This ensures that a large negative number multiplied by a negative number could yield a positive number, potentially becoming the new maximum product.
  
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as lists with all negative numbers or zeros. In such cases, the maximum product will be the largest negative number or zero, respectively.

- **General Case**: For general cases, the function iterates through the list, updating the necessary variables to keep track of the maximum product seen so far.

Given the above analysis, the provided Python function is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
