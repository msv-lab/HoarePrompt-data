Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles an empty list by returning `-inf`.
  - It initializes `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element, which is necessary for the initial comparison.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

- **Correct Updates:**
  - The updates for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensure that the maximum product of any sublist is tracked correctly, even when the current number is negative.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check ensures that the best product found during the iteration is returned, which accounts for the possibility that the maximum product could be found later in the list.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct and follows the dynamic programming approach to find the maximum product of any sublist in the list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
