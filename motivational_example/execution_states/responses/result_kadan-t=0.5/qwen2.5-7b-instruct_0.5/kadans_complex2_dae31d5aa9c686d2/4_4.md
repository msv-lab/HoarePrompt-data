Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1(xs)` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is correct and follows a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This helps in handling cases where a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros. It efficiently computes the maximum product by maintaining the state of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, ensuring that the algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the list.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
