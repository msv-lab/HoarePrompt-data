Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, it updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` using the current element and the previous values of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. This is done to account for the possibility that the product of the current element with the minimum product so far could become the new maximum product, and vice versa.

3. **Update the best product**: After updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge case handling**: If the input list `xs` is empty, the program correctly returns `-inf`.

The logic implemented in the function is consistent with the problem statement of finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. Therefore, the given program is correct.
