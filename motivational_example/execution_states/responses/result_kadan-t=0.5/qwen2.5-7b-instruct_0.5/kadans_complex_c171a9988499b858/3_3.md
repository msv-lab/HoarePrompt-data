Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the provided comments. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the program updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`:
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).

3. **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to the value of `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, as it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, allowing it to find the maximum product even when the product becomes negative due to multiplying with a negative number.
