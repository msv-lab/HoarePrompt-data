Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iterating through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the program updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` using the current element and the previous values of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`**: After updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Handling edge cases**: If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

The logic used in the program is a variation of Kadane's algorithm adapted for finding the maximum product of any sublist. It effectively handles both positive and negative numbers, which is crucial for determining the maximum product when negative numbers are involved.

Thus, the given program is correct.
