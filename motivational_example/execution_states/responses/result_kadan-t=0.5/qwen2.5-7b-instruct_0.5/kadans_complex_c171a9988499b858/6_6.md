Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided comments. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `-inf`.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The logic inside the loop correctly updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` for each element in the list. This is crucial because it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position. This is necessary to handle cases where negative numbers can turn a previously small product into a large one.

4. **Updating Best So Far**: The variable `best_so_far` is updated whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

5. **Final Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

The provided comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, and the logic implemented matches the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
