The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the implementation that prevents it from functioning correctly.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:**
   The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is correct. However, during the iteration, `best_so_far` should be updated whenever a new maximum product is found, not just at the end of the loop.

2. **Updating `best_so_far` During Iteration:**
   The current code only updates `best_so_far` once, after the loop has completed. It should be updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`.

3. **Correct State Description:**
   The state description at the end of the loop is incorrect because `best_so_far` is not guaranteed to hold the maximum product of any sublist at that point.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

- **Initialization:** `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Iteration:** For each element `num` in `xs` starting from the second element:
  - Calculate `temp_max` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - Calculate `temp_min` as the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.
- **Return:** After the loop, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This corrected code ensures that `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found during the iteration, thus providing the correct result.
