The provided solution has a logical flaw that needs to be addressed. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just the one ending at the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far` within the loop**: The original code only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it only considers the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of the list. By updating `best_so_far` within the loop, we ensure that it keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

This change ensures that the function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
