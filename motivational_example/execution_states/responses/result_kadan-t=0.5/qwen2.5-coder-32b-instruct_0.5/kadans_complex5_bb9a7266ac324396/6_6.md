The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the code that prevents it from functioning correctly.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:**
   - The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to `xs[0]`. This is correct initially, but it should be updated during each iteration to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Updating `best_so_far` During Iteration:**
   - The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss out on the maximum product if it occurs before the last element of the list.

### Corrected Code:

To fix these issues, we need to update `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far during each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:

- **Updating `best_so_far`:** By updating `best_so_far` during each iteration, we ensure that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product even if it occurs before the last element of the list.

With this correction, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
