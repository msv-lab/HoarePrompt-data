The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there are some issues in the implementation that need to be addressed.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is fine, but it should be updated during the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far.
2. **Updating `best_so_far` inside the loop:** The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that if the maximum product occurs before the last element, it won't be captured unless it's also the maximum product ending at the last element. The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Initialization:** `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop:** For each number in the list starting from the second element:
  - Calculate `temp_max` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - Calculate `temp_min` as the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`.
  - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return:** After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This corrected code ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly computed and returned.
