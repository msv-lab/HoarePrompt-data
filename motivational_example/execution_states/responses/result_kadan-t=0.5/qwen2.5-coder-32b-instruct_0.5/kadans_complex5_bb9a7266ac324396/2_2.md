The provided solution has a logical flaw that needs to be addressed. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far, not just at the end.

Here's the corrected version of the function with appropriate comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of num, temp_max, and temp_min
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of num, temp_max, and temp_min
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of itself and max_ending_here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` with `num` respectively after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` inside the loop**: This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, not just at the end of the loop.
2. **Use `temp_max` and `temp_min`**: These variables store the intermediate products of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` with the current number `num`, making the code clearer and avoiding overwriting `max_ending_here` before using it to compute `min_ending_here`.

This corrected version should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
