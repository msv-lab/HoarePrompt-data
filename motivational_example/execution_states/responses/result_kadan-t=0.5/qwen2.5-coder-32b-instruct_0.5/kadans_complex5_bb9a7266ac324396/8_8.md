The provided solution is almost correct but there is a small issue. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. Currently, it only gets updated once after the loop ends, which might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far` within the loop**: This ensures that `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product encountered during each iteration, rather than just comparing it once at the end of the loop.

### Execution States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty.
- **Loop Iteration**:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

This change ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
