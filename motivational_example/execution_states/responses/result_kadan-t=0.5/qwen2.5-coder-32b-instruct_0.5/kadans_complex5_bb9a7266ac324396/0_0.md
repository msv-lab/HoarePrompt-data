The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the code that prevents it from functioning correctly.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list. This is fine, but it should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far, not just the maximum product ending at the first element.
2. **Updating `best_so_far`:** The update of `best_so_far` should happen inside the loop, not after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is continuously updated with the maximum product found during each iteration.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code with the necessary changes:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Loop Update:** The line `best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)` has been added inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far during each iteration.
- **Final Return:** After the loop, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

With these changes, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
