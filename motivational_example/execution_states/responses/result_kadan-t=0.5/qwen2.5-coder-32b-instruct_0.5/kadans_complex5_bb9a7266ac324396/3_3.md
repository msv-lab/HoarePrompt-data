The provided solution has a logical flaw that needs to be addressed to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list. However, it should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far.
2. **Updating `best_so_far` within the loop:** The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop ends. This means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs in the middle of the list.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return -inf if the list is empty

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop:** For each element in the list (starting from the second one), update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current number and the previous products.
- **Update `best_so_far`:** After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far during the iteration.
