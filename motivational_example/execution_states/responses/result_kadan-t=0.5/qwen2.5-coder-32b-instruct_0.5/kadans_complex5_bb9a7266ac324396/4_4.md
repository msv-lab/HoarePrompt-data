The provided Python function aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a critical issue with the implementation that affects its correctness.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to `xs[0]` and is only updated if `max_ending_here` exceeds `best_so_far` after the loop. This means that if the maximum product of any sublist occurs before the last element, it might not be captured unless it's also the maximum product ending at the last element.

2. **Updating `best_so_far` within the Loop:** To ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, it should be updated within the loop, not just after the loop.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
        #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Updating `best_so_far` within the Loop:** By updating `best_so_far` within the loop, we ensure that it always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, not just the maximum product ending at the last element.

This corrected function should now accurately compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
