The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just once at the end. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far`:** Inside the loop, after updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.

### Execution States:
- **Initial State:** `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty.
- **Loop Iteration:** For each `num` in `xs[1:]`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`. `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to consider the current number and the product involving the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- **Final State:** After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This corrected function should now accurately compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
