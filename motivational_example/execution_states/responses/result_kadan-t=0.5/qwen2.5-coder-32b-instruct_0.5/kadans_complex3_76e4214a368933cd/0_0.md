Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop, and it is not updated during each iteration of the loop. This means that if the maximum product of any sublist occurs before the last element, it will not be captured.

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration of the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
