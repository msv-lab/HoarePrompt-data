Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop, and it does not track the maximum product found during the iterations. Instead, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop whenever a new maximum product is found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
