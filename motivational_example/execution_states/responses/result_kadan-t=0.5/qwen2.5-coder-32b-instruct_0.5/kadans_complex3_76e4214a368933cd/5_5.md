Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is not being updated within the loop, which means it only holds the value of the first element of the list or the maximum product found at the end of the list. However, it should be updated during each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
