Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop, based on the final values of `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far`. This means that if the maximum product occurs earlier in the list, it won't be captured. Instead, `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration of the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. This ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly identified.
