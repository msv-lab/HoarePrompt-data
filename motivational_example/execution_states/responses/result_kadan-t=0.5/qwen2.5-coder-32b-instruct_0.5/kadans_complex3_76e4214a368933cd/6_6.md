Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. However, `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far during each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in every iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
