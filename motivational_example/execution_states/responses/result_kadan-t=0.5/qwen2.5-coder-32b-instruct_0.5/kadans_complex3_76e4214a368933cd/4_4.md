Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, at the end of the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that it does not keep track of the maximum product found throughout the entire list.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop every time you find a new maximum product (`max_ending_here`). Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here  # Update best_so_far here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, `best_so_far` will always contain the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration over `xs`.
