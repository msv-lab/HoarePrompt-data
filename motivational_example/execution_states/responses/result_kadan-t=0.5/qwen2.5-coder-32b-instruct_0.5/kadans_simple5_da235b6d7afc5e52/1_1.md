The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Explanation of the Solution

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of two values as it iterates through the list:
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of a sublist ending at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of a sublist ending at the current position (important because multiplying a negative number by a negative number can yield a positive product).

The algorithm updates these values at each step and keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far in `best_so_far`.

### Issue with the Solution

The issue arises from the fact that `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated before checking if the current `max_ending_here` is better than `best_so_far`. This means that the comparison `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` might not be comparing the correct value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`.

### Corrected Solution

To fix this, we should update `best_so_far` within the loop after updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Changes
- Introduced `temp_max` and `temp_min` to store intermediate results of `max_ending_here * num` and `min_ending_here * num`.
- Updated `best_so_far` within the loop after recalculating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far, and the solution correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers.
