The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables will store the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the code calculates a temporary value `temp` which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that we consider both the possibility of starting a new sublist with the current number and continuing the existing sublist.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This is important for handling negative numbers correctly.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current number, the code checks if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with an example:

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

- Initial state: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- Iteration 1 (num = 3):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2*3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2*3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`
- Iteration 2 (num = -2):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3*-2) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3*-2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far` remains 6
- Iteration 3 (num = 4):
  - `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12*4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12*4) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, 24) = 24`

The maximum product of any sublist is indeed 24, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately and efficiently computes the desired result.
