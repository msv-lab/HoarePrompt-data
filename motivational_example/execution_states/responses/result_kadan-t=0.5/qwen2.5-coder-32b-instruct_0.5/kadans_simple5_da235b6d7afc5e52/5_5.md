The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the code calculates a temporary product `temp` which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step is crucial because multiplying a negative number by the smallest (most negative) product can yield a large positive product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Potential Issue:
The code correctly handles the case where the list contains negative numbers, but there is a logical flaw in the final comparison:
- The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far: best_so_far = max_ending_here` is redundant because `max_ending_here` is already updated in each iteration to be the maximum possible product ending at that point. Therefore, after the loop, `max_ending_here` will always hold the maximum product of any sublist that ends at the last element of the list.
- However, the correct approach should be to update `best_so_far` during each iteration, not just at the end. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the last element.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far during each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
