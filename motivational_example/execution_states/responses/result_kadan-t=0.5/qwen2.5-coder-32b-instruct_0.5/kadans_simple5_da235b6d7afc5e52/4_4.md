The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that can lead to incorrect results.

### Explanation of the Code

The code uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables will store the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the code calculates a temporary product (`temp`) which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that we consider the possibility of the current number being larger than the product of previous numbers or the product involving a negative number flipping the sign.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This helps in tracking the smallest (most negative) product, which could become the largest when multiplied by another negative number.
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Issue with the Code

The code correctly handles the dynamic programming aspect but has a minor issue in the logic where it updates `best_so_far`. The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop after updating `max_ending_here` for each element. This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product found up to the current position.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original solution is almost correct but has a small logical error in the placement of the `best_so_far` update. The corrected version provided above should correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
