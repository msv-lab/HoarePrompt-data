The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables will store the minimum and maximum products of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the code calculates the potential new maximum (`temp`) by multiplying the current number with `max_ending_here`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This step ensures that we consider the possibility of the current number starting a new subarray or continuing the existing one, and also accounts for the effect of negative numbers.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current position, the code checks if this value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any subarray found during the iteration.

### Correctness and Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list, indicating no valid subarray exists.
- **Single Element**: If the list has only one element, the function correctly returns that element as the maximum product.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function handles negative numbers appropriately by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products.
- **Zeroes**: The presence of zeroes resets the product calculation, as multiplying by zero results in zero, and the algorithm correctly starts fresh after encountering a zero.

### Conclusion

Yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given integer list. The algorithm efficiently handles various edge cases and uses dynamic programming to achieve optimal performance.
