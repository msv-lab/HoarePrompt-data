The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that needs to be addressed.

### Explanation of the Solution

The code uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, calculate the temporary product (`temp`) which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the result.

### Issue in the Code

The code correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` during each iteration, but it only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop. This is correct, but the issue arises when the list contains only one element. In such a case, the function should return that single element as the maximum product, which it does correctly. However, the initialization of `best_so_far` to `float('-inf')` for an empty list is appropriate, but the overall logic is sound for non-empty lists.

### Conclusion

The solution is correct for non-empty lists. It efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist using a single pass through the list, maintaining both the maximum and minimum products at each step to account for the effect of negative numbers.

### Final Answer

Yes, the solution solves the problem for non-empty lists. If you want to handle the edge case of an empty list more explicitly, you could modify the function to return 0 or raise an exception, depending on your requirements. Here's a slightly modified version that returns 0 for an empty list:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return 0  # or raise ValueError("List must not be empty")
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This version handles the empty list case by returning 0, which might be a more intuitive behavior in some contexts.
