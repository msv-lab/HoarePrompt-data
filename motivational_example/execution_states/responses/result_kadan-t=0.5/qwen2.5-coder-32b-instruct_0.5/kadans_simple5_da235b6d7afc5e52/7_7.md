The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Explanation of the Solution

The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The key variables are:

- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far`: The maximum product found so far across all sublists.

### Issue in the Code

The code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` correctly for each element in the list. However, it only updates `best_so_far` after the loop ends if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that if the maximum product occurs at the last element of the list, it will be correctly captured. But if the maximum product occurs earlier in the list and then a smaller product is encountered later, `best_so_far` might not be updated properly.

### Corrected Code

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just after the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far during each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, `best_so_far` is continuously updated to ensure it always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, thus correctly solving the problem.
