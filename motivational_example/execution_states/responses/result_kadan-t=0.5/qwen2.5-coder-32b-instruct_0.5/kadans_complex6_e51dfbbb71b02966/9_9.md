Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop, which means it does not account for the maximum product that could have been found before the last element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`. This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
