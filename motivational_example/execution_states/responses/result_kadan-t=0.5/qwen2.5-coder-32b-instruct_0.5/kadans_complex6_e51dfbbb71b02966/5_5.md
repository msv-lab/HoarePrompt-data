Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the current index. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to always contain the maximum product found so far, ensuring that the final result is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
