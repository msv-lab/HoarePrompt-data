Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the last element. Currently, `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product of a sublist that does not end at the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here  # Update best_so_far within the loop
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is captured correctly.
