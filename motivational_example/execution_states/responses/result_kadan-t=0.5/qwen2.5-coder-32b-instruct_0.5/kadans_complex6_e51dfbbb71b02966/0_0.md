Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just at the end. This is because the maximum product of any sublist can occur at any point in the list, not just at the end. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.
