Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far. However, in the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that if the maximum product occurs in a sublist that does not end at the last element of `xs`, it will not be captured.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is captured correctly.
