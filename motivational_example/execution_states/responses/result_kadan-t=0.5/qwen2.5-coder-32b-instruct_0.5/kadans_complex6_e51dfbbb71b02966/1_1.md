Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop, based on the final values of `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far`. However, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it holds the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, ensuring that it always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the iteration.
