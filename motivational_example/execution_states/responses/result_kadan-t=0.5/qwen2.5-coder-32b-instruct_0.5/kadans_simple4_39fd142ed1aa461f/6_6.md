The provided solution is almost correct but there's a small issue with how `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are being updated. The key idea in solving this problem is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary max and min products up to the current number
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update the best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Temporary Variables:** Introduced `temp_max` and `temp_min` to store the intermediate results of multiplying the current number with the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that the updates to `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` do not interfere with each other.
- **Correct Updates:** The updates to `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` now correctly consider all possible combinations (current number alone, product with the previous max, product with the previous min).

This corrected function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
