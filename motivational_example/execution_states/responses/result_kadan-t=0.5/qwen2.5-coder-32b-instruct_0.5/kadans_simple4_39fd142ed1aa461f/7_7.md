The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there is a small issue with the implementation that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Issue:
The variable `best_so_far` is updated only after the loop, but it should be updated during each iteration of the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Corrected Solution:
Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each number in the list (starting from the second element), calculate the potential new maximum and minimum products ending at the current position.
- **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These variables track the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at the current position. The minimum product is tracked because multiplying a negative number by the minimum product could result in a large positive product.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update accordingly.

This approach ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly identified.
