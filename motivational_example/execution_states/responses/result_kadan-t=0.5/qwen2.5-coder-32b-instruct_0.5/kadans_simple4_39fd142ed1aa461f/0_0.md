The provided solution is almost correct but there is a small issue with how `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated. The current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where multiplying by the current number could potentially flip the sign of the product, which might lead to incorrect results.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here because it will be overwritten
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the possibility of flipping signs
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here considering the possibility of flipping signs
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Start with the first element as both `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element, calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering the current number alone, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update accordingly.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered and the maximum product is found efficiently in O(n) time complexity.
