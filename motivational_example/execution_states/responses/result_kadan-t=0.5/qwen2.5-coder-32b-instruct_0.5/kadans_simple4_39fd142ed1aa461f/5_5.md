The provided solution is almost correct but there's a small issue with how `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are being updated. The key idea in solving this problem is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here before updating it
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous max_ending_here, and the product of the current number and the previous min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far if the new max_ending_here is greater
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Start by initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - Calculate the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` accordingly.
  - Update `best_so_far` if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that you correctly handle both positive and negative numbers in the list.
