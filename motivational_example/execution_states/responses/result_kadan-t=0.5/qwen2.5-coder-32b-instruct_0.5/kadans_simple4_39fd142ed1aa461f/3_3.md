The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue in the logic that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. The main idea of the solution is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, as the minimum product can become the maximum if multiplied by a negative number.

Here's the corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary max product before updating min_ending_here
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update min_ending_here first
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Now update max_ending_here using the original max_ending_here value
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Order of Updates**: The key change is the order in which `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated. The original code updates `max_ending_here` first, which can lead to incorrect results because it uses the newly updated `min_ending_here` in the calculation. By updating `min_ending_here` first, we ensure that both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are calculated based on the previous state.

2. **Best So Far Update**: The `best_so_far` variable is updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases.
