The provided solution is almost correct, but there is a small issue with how `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are being updated. The logic should correctly handle the multiplication of negative numbers, which can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. However, the current implementation might not correctly update these values in all scenarios.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here because it will be overwritten
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous max, and the product of the current number and the previous min
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points:
- **Handling Negatives:** When multiplying by a negative number, the maximum product could become the minimum and vice versa. Therefore, both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` need to be updated in each iteration.
- **Storing Temporary Values:** Since `max_ending_here` is updated first, its previous value needs to be stored temporarily (`temp_max`) before updating `min_ending_here`.

This corrected version should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
