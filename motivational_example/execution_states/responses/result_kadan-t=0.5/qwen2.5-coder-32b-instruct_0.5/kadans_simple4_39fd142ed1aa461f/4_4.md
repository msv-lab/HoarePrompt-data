The provided solution is almost correct but there is a small issue with the logic that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. The main idea of the solution is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary max product before updating min_ending_here
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Temporary Variable `temp_max`:** Before updating `min_ending_here`, we calculate `temp_max` which is `max_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we use the previous value of `max_ending_here` when calculating `min_ending_here`.

2. **Update `best_so_far` Inside Loop:** We update `best_so_far` inside the loop after calculating `max_ending_here` to ensure that we always have the maximum product found so far.

These changes ensure that the algorithm correctly handles lists with negative numbers and zeros.
