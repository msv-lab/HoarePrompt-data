Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists. Overall, the logic and implementation are correct for solving the problem described.
