Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming by keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. The solution handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists.
