Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, as the minimum product can become the maximum if multiplied by a negative number. This ensures that all possible sublists are considered efficiently. The solution handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, indicating no valid sublist exists.
