Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far, which is updated whenever a larger product is found. The solution handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists.
