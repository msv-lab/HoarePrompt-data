Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within the given list of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far, and it is updated whenever a larger product is found. The function also handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid product can be computed.
