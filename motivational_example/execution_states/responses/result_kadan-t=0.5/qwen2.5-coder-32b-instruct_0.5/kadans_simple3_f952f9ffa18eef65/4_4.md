Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The key idea is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because multiplying a negative number by the minimum product could result in a new maximum product. The algorithm iterates through the list, updating these values and keeping track of the best (maximum) product found so far. This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered efficiently.
