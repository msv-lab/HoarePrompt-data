Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists. The solution handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists.
