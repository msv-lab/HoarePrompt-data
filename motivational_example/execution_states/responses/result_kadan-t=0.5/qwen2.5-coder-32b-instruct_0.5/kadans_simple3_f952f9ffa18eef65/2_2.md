Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach where it keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable is updated to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always stored. The solution handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, indicating no valid sublist exists.
