Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as subarray) within a given list of integers. The approach used is dynamic programming, where it keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate for a problem seeking a maximum value. Overall, the logic and implementation appear correct.
