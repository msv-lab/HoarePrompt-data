Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists. Overall, the logic and implementation appear to be correct for solving the problem as described.
