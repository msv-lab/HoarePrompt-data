The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just at the end. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum value found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Update `best_so_far` inside the loop:** The original code only updates `best_so_far` after the loop ends. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it always contains the maximum product of any sublist found up to the current element.

This change ensures that the function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist for all possible cases.
