The provided solution has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers. The issue lies in the fact that the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop, which means it does not account for the maximum product found during the iterations.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop whenever a new maximum product is found. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if a new maximum product is found
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far` within the loop**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far` to be `max_ending_here`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the traversal of the list.
