The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step, not just after the loop. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Problem:
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each number in the list (starting from the second element), update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.
- **Return `best_so_far`**: After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
