The provided solution has a logical flaw that needs to be addressed. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far, rather than only being updated once after the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here` in each iteration, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the iteration through the list.
