The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue. The variable `best_so_far` is not being updated correctly during the loop. It should be updated in every iteration to keep track of the maximum product found so far, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far`:** The original code only updates `best_so_far` after the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that it might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element of the list. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that we are always keeping track of the maximum product encountered so far.

This change ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
