The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`**: The variable `best_so_far` should be initialized to the first element of the list, which is correctly done. However, it should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

2. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. This means that if the maximum product occurs before the last element, it might not be captured correctly. Instead, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` with `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop Updates**: During each iteration, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated based on the current number and the previous maximum and minimum products.
- **Best So Far Update**: `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

This corrected version should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
