The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just those ending at the current element. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here considering the current number and the product with previous max/min
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far` inside the loop:** The original code only updates `best_so_far` once, after the loop. This means it only considers the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists.
- **State Comments:** The state comments have been adjusted to reflect the updated logic.

This corrected solution should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
