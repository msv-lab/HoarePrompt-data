The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. Currently, it only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs in the middle or earlier part of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop whenever a new maximum product (`max_ending_here`) is found. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
