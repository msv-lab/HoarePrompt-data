Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as subarray) within a given list of integers. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach, keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. The code handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate if no valid sublist exists.
