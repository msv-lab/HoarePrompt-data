Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as subarray) within a given list of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product ending at the current index.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all subarrays.

For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering three possibilities:
1. The current number itself (`num`).
2. The product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`.
3. The product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here` (which could become the new maximum if both numbers are negative).

Finally, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that all possible subarrays are considered, and the maximum product is correctly identified.
