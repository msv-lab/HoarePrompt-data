Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles, keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product could yield a new maximum product. The solution also handles edge cases, such as an empty list, by returning negative infinity, which is a common convention for indicating that no valid sublist exists.
