Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. The key idea is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, as a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied.

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the largest product found so far across all sublists.

For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the algorithm updates these three variables based on the current element and the previous values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. This ensures that the algorithm considers all possible sublists ending at the current position.

Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

The initial check for an empty list returning `float('-inf')` is also appropriate, as it indicates that there is no valid sublist product to be computed in such a case.
