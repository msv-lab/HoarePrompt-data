Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist product exists. The logic within the loop correctly updates the `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` variables based on the current number and previous products, ensuring that the maximum possible product is found by the end of the iteration.
