Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. The solution handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate if no valid sublist exists.
