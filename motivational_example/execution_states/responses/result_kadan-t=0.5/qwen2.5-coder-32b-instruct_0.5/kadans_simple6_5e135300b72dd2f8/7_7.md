Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, indicating that no valid sublist exists. The comments in the code also reflect the expected behavior of the program.
