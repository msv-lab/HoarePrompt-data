Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The key idea is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product could yield a new maximum product. The solution iterates through the list, updating these values accordingly, and keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far. The final result is returned as the maximum product of any sublist.
