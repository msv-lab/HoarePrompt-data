Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The key idea is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product. The solution iterates through the list, updating these values and keeping track of the best (maximum) product found so far. The final result is the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
