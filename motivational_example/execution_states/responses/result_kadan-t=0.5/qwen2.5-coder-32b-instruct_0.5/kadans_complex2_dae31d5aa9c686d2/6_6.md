Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers.

### Key Concepts
- **Sublist**: A contiguous part of the list.
- **Product**: The result of multiplying all elements in a sublist.
- **Max Product Sublist**: The sublist whose product is the largest among all possible sublists.

### Algorithm Analysis
The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of two values as it iterates through the list:
- `max_ending_here`: Maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: Minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position. This is important because multiplying a negative number with the smallest product could yield a large positive product.

### Steps of the Algorithm
1. **Initialization**:
   - If the list is empty, return `-inf` since no sublist exists.
   - Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, calculate the temporary product (`temp`) of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

3. **Result**:
   - After iterating through the list, `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Verification
- **Initialization**: Properly handles the edge case of an empty list.
- **Iteration**: Correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
- **Result**: Ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
