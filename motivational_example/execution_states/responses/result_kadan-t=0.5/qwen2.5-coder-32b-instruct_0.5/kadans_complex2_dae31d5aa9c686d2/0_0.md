Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers.

### Key Concepts:
- **Sublist**: A contiguous part of a list.
- **Product**: The result of multiplying elements together.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The algorithm uses variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list. This is because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initial Check**: 
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` which correctly indicates that there is no valid sublist to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`.
   - These variables will be used to track the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current index, as well as the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list `xs` (starting from the second element), the following steps are performed:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`. This represents the product of the current sublist extended by `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current index.
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current index.

4. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After processing each element, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist using a dynamic programming approach. It handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately and updates the maximum product found so far during each iteration.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
