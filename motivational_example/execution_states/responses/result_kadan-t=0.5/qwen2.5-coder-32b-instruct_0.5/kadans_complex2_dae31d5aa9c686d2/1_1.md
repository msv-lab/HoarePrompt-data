To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its logic and see if it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` which is appropriate because there is no sublist in an empty list, and thus no product to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists that end at the current position in the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current index.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by the minimum product could become the maximum product.

4. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program is sound. It correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, and it efficiently computes the maximum product of any sublist in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the list.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
