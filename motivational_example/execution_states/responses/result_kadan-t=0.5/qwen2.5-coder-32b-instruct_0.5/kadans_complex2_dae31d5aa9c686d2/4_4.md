To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic step by step.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers.

### Key Concepts:
- **max_ending_here**: This variable keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist that ends at the current position.
- **min_ending_here**: This variable keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist that ends at the current position. It is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **best_so_far**: This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is correct since there are no sublists to consider.
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. This makes sense because the maximum product of a sublist containing only the first element is the element itself.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list, the program calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number alone could be larger, or that multiplying the current number with the previous minimum product could yield a new maximum.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is crucial for handling negative numbers correctly.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the algorithm for finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. It handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
