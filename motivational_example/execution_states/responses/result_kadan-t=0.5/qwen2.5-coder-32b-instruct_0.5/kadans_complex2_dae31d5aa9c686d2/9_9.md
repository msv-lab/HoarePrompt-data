Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Objective:
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given list of integers.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` which is appropriate because there is no sublist to consider.
   - It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This makes sense because the maximum and minimum product sublists that end at the first element are just the element itself.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we consider the current number alone, the extension of the previous maximum product sublist, and also the possibility of flipping the sign by multiplying with the previous minimum product sublist.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This helps in keeping track of the smallest product, which can become the largest if multiplied by a negative number.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current element, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The logic correctly handles the scenarios where the product can change drastically due to negative numbers and ensures that all possible sublists are considered. The use of both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is crucial for handling the sign changes effectively.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
