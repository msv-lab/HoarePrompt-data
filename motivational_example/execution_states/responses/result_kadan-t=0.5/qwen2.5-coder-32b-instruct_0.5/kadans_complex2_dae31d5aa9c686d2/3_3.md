Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop completes, and it does not track the maximum product found throughout the iterations. Instead, it should be updated during each iteration whenever a new maximum product is found. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
