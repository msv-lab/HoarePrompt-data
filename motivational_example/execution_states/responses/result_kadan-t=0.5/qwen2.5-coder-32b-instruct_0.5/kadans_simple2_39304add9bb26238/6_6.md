To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step.

The problem requires finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The provided solution uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables will store the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list (starting from the second element), the algorithm calculates the product of the current element with the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. This is stored in `temp`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could result in a larger positive product.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly, but to the minimum value, which helps in capturing the smallest (most negative) product ending at the current position.
   
3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current element, the algorithm checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist found during the iteration.

The logic of the algorithm appears to be correct and aligns with the requirements of the problem. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers in the list.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
