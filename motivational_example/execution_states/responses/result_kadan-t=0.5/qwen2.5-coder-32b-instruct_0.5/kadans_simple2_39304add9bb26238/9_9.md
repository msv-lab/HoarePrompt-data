Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is a reasonable value since there are no sublists to consider.
   - It initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: This keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position. It's initialized to the first element of the list.
     - `max_ending_here`: This keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position. It's also initialized to the first element of the list.
     - `best_so_far`: This keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists. It's initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function then iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates a temporary variable `temp` which is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`. This step is crucial because multiplying the current number with the maximum product ending at the previous position helps in determining the new maximum product ending at the current position.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. The reason for including `min_ending_here * num` is that a negative number multiplied by a negative minimum product could result in a positive maximum product.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is necessary to keep track of the smallest product, which could become the largest if multiplied by a negative number.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current position, the function checks if this new maximum is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to this new maximum.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently computes the desired result in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the input list. Therefore, the function is correct.
