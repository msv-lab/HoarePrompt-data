Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist (contiguous subarray) within the given integer list `xs`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent number in the list, the algorithm calculates a temporary product (`temp`) which is the product of the current number and the maximum product ending at the previous position (`max_ending_here`).
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position (`min_ending_here`). The reason for considering `min_ending_here * num` is that multiplying a negative number by a negative minimum can result in a positive maximum.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
   
3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the algorithm checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list, making it suitable for large lists. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
