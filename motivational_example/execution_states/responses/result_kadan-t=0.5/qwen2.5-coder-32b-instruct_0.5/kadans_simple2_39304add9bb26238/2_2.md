Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent number in the list, the algorithm calculates the potential new maximum and minimum products that can be formed by including the current number.
   - `temp` stores the product of the current number and the previous maximum product (`max_ending_here * num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`). This last case handles scenarios where multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.

3. **Updating Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current position, the algorithm checks if this value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to this new maximum.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list.

This approach efficiently computes the desired result in a single pass through the list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. Therefore, the program is correct.
