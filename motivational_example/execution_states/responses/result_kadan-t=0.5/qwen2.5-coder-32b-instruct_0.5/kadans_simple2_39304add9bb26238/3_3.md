To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. The key challenge here is that the presence of negative numbers can turn a small product into a large one and vice versa.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach. It maintains two variables, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, which represent the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position in the list, respectively. This dual tracking is necessary because multiplying a negative number with the smallest product could yield the largest product.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), indicating no valid product can be formed.
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the function calculates a temporary product `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product possible ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product possible ending at the current position.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After processing all elements, the function updates `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should hold the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases, such as lists containing negative numbers. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
