Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. This is necessary because the maximum and minimum products at the start are simply the first element itself.

2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element (`num`), it calculates the potential new maximum (`temp`) by multiplying the current `max_ending_here` with `num`.

3. **Updating Maximum and Minimum**: It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. The reason for considering `min_ending_here * num` is that a negative number multiplied by a negative minimum can become a positive maximum. Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Updating Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist found during the iteration.

This approach efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list. Thus, the program is correct.
