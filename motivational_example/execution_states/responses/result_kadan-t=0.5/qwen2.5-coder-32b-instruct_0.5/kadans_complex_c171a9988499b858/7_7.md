Correctness: **False**

The annotated program contains a logical error in the final state description and the update logic for `best_so_far`. The issue arises from the fact that `best_so_far` is not being updated correctly throughout the loop. Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them:

### Issues:
1. **Initial State Description**: The final state description in the comments is incorrect. It incorrectly states that `best_so_far` is initialized to `xs[0]` after the loop, which is not true because `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop whenever a larger `max_ending_here` is found.

2. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. However, `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop every time a new maximum `max_ending_here` is found.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code with appropriate comments:

```python
# Problem:
# Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here considering the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater than best_so_far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`;
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any subarray in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider the current number, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any subarray in the list.
