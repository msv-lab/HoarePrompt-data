Correctness: **False**

The annotated program has a mistake in its final state description and logic. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far, not just after the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary changes:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the iteration.
