Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the final state description and the logic to update `best_so_far`. The comment suggests that `best_so_far` is initially set to `xs[0]` and does not get updated correctly throughout the loop. However, the code actually updates `best_so_far` within the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds it.

Here's the corrected version with comments explaining the changes:

```python
# Problem:
# Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`;
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In the original program, the final state comment was incorrect because it stated `best_so_far` is always `xs[0]`, which is not true as it gets updated during the loop. The logic of the program itself is correct, but the comment needs to be updated to reflect the actual behavior of the program.
