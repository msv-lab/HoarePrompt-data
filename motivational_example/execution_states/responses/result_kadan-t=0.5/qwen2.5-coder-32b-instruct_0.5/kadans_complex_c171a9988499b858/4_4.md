Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct but has a minor issue in its final state annotation. Specifically, the final state annotation incorrectly states that `best_so_far` is always `xs[0]` after the loop. In reality, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`.

Here's the corrected version of the final state annotation:

```python
#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
```

Additionally, the initial state annotation after the loop should reflect that `best_so_far` has been updated throughout the loop to hold the maximum product found.

Here is the corrected code with proper annotations:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

This correction ensures that the annotations accurately reflect the state of the variables at each point in the program.
