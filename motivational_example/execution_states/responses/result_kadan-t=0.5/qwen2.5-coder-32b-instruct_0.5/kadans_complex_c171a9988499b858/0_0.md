Correctness: **False**

The annotated program contains a logical error in the final state description and the overall logic for updating `best_so_far`. Here's why:

1. The comment before the final return statement incorrectly states that `best_so_far` is initialized to `xs[0]` at that point. In fact, `best_so_far` is supposed to keep track of the maximum product found so far across all subarrays, not just the one ending at the current index.

2. The update of `best_so_far` should happen inside the loop, not after it. This ensures that `best_so_far` is continuously updated with the maximum product encountered during the iteration over the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
