# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given problem requires finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list.
2. The solution provided attempts to solve this problem using dynamic programming.
3. The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
4. **The algorithm iterates over the list, updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current number and the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.**
5. **However, the update of `best_so_far` seems incomplete, as it only checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` after the loop, but `max_ending_here` is updated at each step and should be checked against `best_so_far` at each step.**
6. The solution does not consider the case where the maximum product is achieved by a single element or a sublist that does not include the first element.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    """
    This function calculates the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

    Args:
        xs (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum product of any sublist.
    """
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here before updating it
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
* **Moved the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop**: Now `best_so_far` is updated at each step, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product found so far.
* **No other changes are necessary**: The rest of the solution is correct and only needed a minor adjustment to update `best_so_far` correctly.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0
print(func_1([-4, -3, -2]))   # Output: 12
