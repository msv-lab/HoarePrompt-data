**Correctness: False**

The issue with the given program is that it doesn't correctly update the `best_so_far` variable inside the loop. It should update `best_so_far` whenever it finds a new maximum product, but the current implementation only updates it after the loop.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

Alternatively, you can simplify the code by removing the `best_so_far` variable and returning `max_ending_here` directly, since `max_ending_here` will always store the maximum product found so far:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    return max_ending_here
```
