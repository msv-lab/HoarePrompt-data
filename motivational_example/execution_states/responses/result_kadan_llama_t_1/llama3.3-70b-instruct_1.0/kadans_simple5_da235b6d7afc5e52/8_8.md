**Yes**, the provided Python solution solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
   - It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - It iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates the maximum and minimum product ending at the current position by considering the following options:
     - The current number itself.
     - The product of the current number and the maximum product ending at the previous position (`max_ending_here * num`).
     - The product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position (`min_ending_here * num`).
   - It updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` based on these calculations.

3. **Tracking the Best Result**:
   - After each iteration, it updates `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which represents the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, and the space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 

**Example use case**:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))  # Output: 0
```
