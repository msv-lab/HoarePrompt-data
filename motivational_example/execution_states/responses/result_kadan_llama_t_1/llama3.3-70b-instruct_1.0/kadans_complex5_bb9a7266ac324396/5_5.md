# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. The given function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input and is supposed to return the maximum product of any sublist.
2. The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of `xs`. 
3. It then iterates over the rest of the list. For each number, it calculates the maximum and minimum product of sublists ending at that number by considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum, and the product of the current number and the previous minimum.
4. **However, the issue arises in updating `best_so_far`**. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, using the last calculated `max_ending_here`. This is incorrect because `best_so_far` should be updated at each iteration if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.
5. Another issue is that `best_so_far` is not updated correctly inside the loop. It should be updated whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.

# Fixed solution:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return best_so_far
```

# Explanation of changes:
*   **Moved the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop**: Now `best_so_far` is updated at each iteration, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far.
*   **Updated the comparison for `best_so_far`**: Now `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1([0, 0, 0]))  # Output: 0
print(func_1([]))  # Output: -inf
```
