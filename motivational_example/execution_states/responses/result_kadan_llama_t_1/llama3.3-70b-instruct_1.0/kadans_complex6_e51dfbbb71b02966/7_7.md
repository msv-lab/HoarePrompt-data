Correctness: **False**

The issue with the given program is that it doesn't correctly update the `best_so_far` variable. Currently, it only updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than it after the loop finishes. However, it should be updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This way, `best_so_far` will always hold the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, and the function will return the correct result.
