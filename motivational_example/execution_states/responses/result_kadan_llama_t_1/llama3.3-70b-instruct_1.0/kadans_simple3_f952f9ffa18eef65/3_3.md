**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct. It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist. The key insight is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, because a negative number can turn a maximum product into a minimum product.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. It iterates through the rest of the list, updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step.
3. It uses a temporary variable `temp` to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the maximum and minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
4. Finally, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater, and returns `best_so_far`.

However, the line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far: best_so_far = max_ending_here` is unnecessary, because `best_so_far` is already updated inside the loop. A more concise version of the program would be:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

Or, even more concisely:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```
