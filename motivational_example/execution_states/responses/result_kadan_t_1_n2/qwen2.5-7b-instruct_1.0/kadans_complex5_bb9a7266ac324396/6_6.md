Let's carefully analyze the provided solution to ensure it meets the requirements of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers.

### Analysis

#### Key Components
- **Variables**:
  - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
  - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

#### Logic Breakdown
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, compute `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values:
     - The current number itself.
     - `temp` (product of `max_ending_here` and the current number).
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values:
     - The current number itself.
     - `temp`.
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all elements, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Correctness
The logic in the code is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```

2. **Loop through the list**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```

4. **Return `best_so_far`**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Example Test Cases

Let's test this function with a few examples to ensure it works correctly.

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far

# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 12 (sublist [-2, -3])
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```
