The annotated program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem described. Let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure clarity and correctness.

### Problem Description
Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function checks if the list is empty (`if not xs:`). If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This handles the case where there is no valid sublist to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - Initialize `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. This variable will store the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`for num in xs[1:]`):
     - Calculate the temporary product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp = max_ending_here * num`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current number itself (`num`),
       - The temporary product (`temp`),
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current number itself (`num`),
       - The temporary product (`temp`),
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, update `best_so_far` to the value of `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the result.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly. For example, a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- The `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` variables help in maintaining the state of the products of sublists efficiently.

### Example Execution States
Let's walk through an example to ensure the states and logic align with the problem:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

- **Initial State**:
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- **Iteration 1 (num = 3)**:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`

- **Iteration 2 (num = -2)**:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6`

- **Iteration 3 (num = 4)**:
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - `best_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6`

- **Final State**:
  - Return `best_so_far = 6`

This example shows that the algorithm correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist.
