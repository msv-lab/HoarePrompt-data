The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few minor issues and could be improved for clarity and correctness. Let's go through the code step by step and identify any problems.

### Original Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Return Statement Location**: The `return float('-inf')` is misplaced. It should be inside the `if` statement that checks if the list is empty.
2. **Initial Values**: The initial values for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` can be set to `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` respectively, to handle cases where the list contains negative numbers.

### Improved Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function with improved comments and logic:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # State: xs is a list of integers.
    if not xs:
        # If the list is empty, return -inf
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = float('-inf')
    max_ending_here = float('inf')
    best_so_far = float('-inf')

    for num in xs:
        # Calculate temporary values
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        # Update best_so_far if current max_ending_here is better
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: *`xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Return Statement**: Moved the `return float('-inf')` inside the `if not xs` block.
2. **Initial Values**: Changed `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` respectively to handle negative numbers correctly.
3. **Temporary Variables**: Added temporary variables `temp_max` and `temp_min` to make the logic clearer.

This revised function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
