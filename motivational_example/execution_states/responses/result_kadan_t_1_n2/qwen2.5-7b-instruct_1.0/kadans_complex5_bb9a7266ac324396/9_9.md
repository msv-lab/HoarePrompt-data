Let's analyze the provided Python function step-by-step to ensure it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Base Case**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. It correctly returns `-inf` because there are no elements to form a product, and thus the maximum product should be negative infinity.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Here, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list, and `best_so_far` is also set to the first element. This is a good starting point for tracking the minimum and maximum products ending at each position.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   This loop iterates through the rest of the list:
   - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num` (considering a new start), `temp` (continuing the existing sequence), and `min_ending_here * num` (reversing the sign due to multiplication by a negative number).
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num` (considering a new start), `temp` (continuing the existing sequence), and `min_ending_here * num` (reversing the sign due to multiplication by a negative number).

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   After the loop, we check if `max_ending_here` (the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element) is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.

### Conclusion

The logic in the function appears to be correct. The algorithm correctly handles the transition between minimum and maximum products, considering both positive and negative numbers, and ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is found. 

Thus, the solution is correct, and the annotated program accurately reflects the state changes and logic of the function.

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    return best_so_far
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
