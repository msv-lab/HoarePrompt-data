The provided solution is generally correct and uses the concept of Kadane's algorithm, but there are a few points that need attention for clarity and correctness.

Here is the revised version with appropriate comments and explanations:

```python
# Problem:
# Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty.

    # State: xs is a non-empty list of integers
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: `num` is the current number in the iteration, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider both positive and negative products.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
        # State: If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element, we calculate:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - We then update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, we update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach works because it considers both the maximum and minimum products at each step, which helps in handling cases where the product can become large due to negative numbers.
