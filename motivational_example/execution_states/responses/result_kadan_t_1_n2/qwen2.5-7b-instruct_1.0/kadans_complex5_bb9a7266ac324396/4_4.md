The annotated program looks mostly correct, but there are a few improvements and clarifications that can be made. Here is the revised version of the program with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty.

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary value to update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the temporary product, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here considering the current number, the temporary product, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    # After the loop, check if the updated max_ending_here is greater than the best_so_far
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far

# Example usage
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each element `num`, calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` using the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Update `min_ending_here` using the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

### Correctness:
- This approach correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, as it maintains both the maximum and minimum products up to the current element, allowing it to detect when a negative number could flip the sign of the maximum product.
- The initial check for an empty list ensures that the function returns `-inf` as expected.

This implementation should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
