Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. Here's a detailed explanation of why the solution works and how it handles various cases:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num in xs[1:]`), the code calculates:
     - `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
       - The current number `num`.
       - The temporary product `temp`.
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number `num`.

     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
       - The current number `num`.
       - The temporary product `temp`.
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current number `num`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` when the input list is empty.
- **Single Element List**: In this case, `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` will all be the single element, so the function will return that element.
- **Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers because the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of handling edge cases, the provided solution is indeed correct.
