The given solution appears to be correct based on the annotated program. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`, representing the best product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider the maximum and minimum products that can end at the current element.
   - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf` to indicate no valid product exists.

Therefore, the annotated states and comments correctly describe the flow of the algorithm, and the solution appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
