The given program appears to be correct. Let's break down the logic to ensure it works as intended.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf`, indicating that there is no valid product to consider.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   These variables are initialized with the first element of the list. The variable `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position, while `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position. `best_so_far` stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   For each element in the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This accounts for the possibility that a negative number can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This helps track the smallest product, which can also be important for future updates.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   After the loop, the code checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary. Finally, it returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification:

The algorithm effectively handles all cases:
- It correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist.
- It considers both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` is robust.
- It ensures that even if the list has only one element, the correct answer is returned.

Thus, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
