To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step.

### Problem Recap
Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Provided Solution Analysis
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the input list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points of the Logic
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
2. **Iterate Through List**: 
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
3. **Update Best So Far**: 
   - After processing all elements, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Explanation of the Logic
- **Handling Sublist Ends with Negative Numbers**: 
  - If the current number (`num`) is negative, multiplying it with `max_ending_here` can result in a smaller (more negative) number, but multiplying it with `min_ending_here` can result in a larger (less negative) number.
  - This ensures that both the positive and negative numbers are considered correctly.
  
- **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**:
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (`temp`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (`temp`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

### Verification
The logic is sound and correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zero. It also correctly updates the best product found so far.

### Conclusion
The provided solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
