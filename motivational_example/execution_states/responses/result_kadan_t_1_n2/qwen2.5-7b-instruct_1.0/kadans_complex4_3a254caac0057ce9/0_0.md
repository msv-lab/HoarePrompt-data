The solution provided is mostly correct but has a small issue in the logic for updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. Let's review and correct it.

The problem statement is to find the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers. The solution uses a dynamic programming approach where `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position, and `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is because a negative number can turn a large positive product into a very small one or vice versa.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize the variables
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary variable to store the current max and min products
        temp_max = max(max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num, num)
        temp_min = min(max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num, num)
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = temp_max
        min_ending_here = temp_min
        
        # Update the best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is larger
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Let's break down the changes:
- Introduced a temporary variable `temp_max` and `temp_min` to simplify the logic.
- Corrected the way `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated. Now, `min_ending_here` correctly takes the minimum of `max_ending_here * num`, `min_ending_here * num`, and `num`.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros.

### Example Execution:
- For `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function should return `6` (from the sublist `[2, 3]`).
- For `xs = [-1, -2, -3, 0]`, the function should return `6` (from the sublist `[-1, -2, -3]`).

This corrected implementation should provide the correct maximum product of any sublist.
