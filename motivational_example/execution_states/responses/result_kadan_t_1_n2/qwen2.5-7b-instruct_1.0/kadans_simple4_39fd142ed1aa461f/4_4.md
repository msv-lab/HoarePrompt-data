The provided solution seems to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Let's break down the logic to understand how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the code calculates three possible products:
     - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here` (i.e., `temp`).
     - The current element itself.
     - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values. This helps in handling negative numbers, as multiplying a negative number with the current element can sometimes yield a larger positive product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of these three values. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative products when needed.
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After iterating through the entire list, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the solution again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This solution correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zeros, and it efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in linear time \(O(n)\).
