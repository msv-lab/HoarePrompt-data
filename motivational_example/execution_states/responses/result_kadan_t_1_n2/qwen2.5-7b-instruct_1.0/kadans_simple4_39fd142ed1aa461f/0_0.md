The provided solution seems mostly correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there are a few points to consider and minor improvements that can be made:

1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` should both be set to 1 when the list contains only negative numbers or zeros.
2. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`, which is good.

Let's refine the code slightly:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Save the current max_ending_here value before updating it
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: Set `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. **Saving Previous Value**: Save the previous value of `max_ending_here` (before updating) in a temporary variable `temp_max`. This is done to correctly compute the new `min_ending_here`.
3. **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These updates ensure that we correctly track the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which helps in handling cases where a large negative number can turn into a large positive product.

This refined version should work correctly for all edge cases, including lists with multiple zeros, negative numbers, and large positive numbers.
