The provided solution appears to be correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element, representing the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`, three possibilities are considered:
     - Starting a new subarray at `num`.
     - Extending the existing subarray ending at `max_ending_here` by multiplying it with `num`.
     - Extending the existing subarray ending at `min_ending_here` by multiplying it with `num`.

3. **Updating Variables**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of these three possibilities.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of these three possibilities.
   - `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Example:
Consider the input list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`.
- For `num = 3`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = max(3, 6, 6) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, min_ending_here * 3) = min(3, 6, 6) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = 6` (remains unchanged).

- For `num = -2`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * -2 = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = max(-2, -12, -6) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, min_ending_here * -2) = min(-2, -12, -6) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = 6` (remains unchanged).

- For `num = 4`:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * 4 = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, min_ending_here * 4) = max(4, -8, -48) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, min_ending_here * 4) = min(4, -8, -48) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = 6` (remains unchanged).

After iterating through the entire list, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist, which in this case is `6`.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively by maintaining the minimum and maximum products ending at each position.
