The provided Python function `func_1` seems to be correctly solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

### Explanation

The function uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of two values at each step:
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product of the sublist ending at the current element.
- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product of the sublist ending at the current element.

This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large negative one and vice versa. By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products, we can handle these cases appropriately.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element itself.
       - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

     - Updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current element itself.
       - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
       - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - If the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the result.

### Correctness and Efficiency

- **Correctness**: The function should work correctly for all input lists, including those with negative numbers and zeros.
- **Efficiency**: The function runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list, since it only iterates through the list once.

### Example

Let's test the function with a few examples to verify its correctness.

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (from subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (from subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (from subarray [-2, -3, 7])
```

### Conclusion

The provided solution appears to be correct and efficient for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.
