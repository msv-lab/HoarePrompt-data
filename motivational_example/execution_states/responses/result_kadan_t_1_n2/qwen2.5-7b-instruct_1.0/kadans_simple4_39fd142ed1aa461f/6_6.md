The provided Python function `func_1` seems to solve the problem correctly. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the array. This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, as it will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the array, the function calculates three possible values:
     - The current element itself (`num`).
     - The product of the current element and the previous maximum product ending here (`temp`).
     - The product of the current element and the previous minimum product ending here.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on these three values.
   - The reason for updating both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is that a negative number can flip the sign when multiplied with a negative number, potentially creating a new maximum product.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if the `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Usage

Let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
```

### Correctness Verification

The provided code should work correctly for most cases, including edge cases like all negative numbers or zero. However, to ensure correctness, you might want to add some test cases to cover different scenarios.

Here are some additional test cases you can use:

```python
assert func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]) == 6
assert func_1([-2, 0, -1]) == 0
assert func_1([-2, -3, 7]) == 42
assert func_1([-1, -3, -10, 0, 60]) == 60
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 120
assert func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == 24
assert func_1([]) == float('-inf')
assert func_1([0, 0, 0, 0]) == 0
```

The provided solution appears to be correct and efficient for solving the given problem.
