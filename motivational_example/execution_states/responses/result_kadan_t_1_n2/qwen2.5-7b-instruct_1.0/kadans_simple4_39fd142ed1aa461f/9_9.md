The provided solution seems to be on the right track for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` can be improved to better handle negative numbers. The current logic might not correctly propagate the minimum product when encountering a negative number.

2. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are set to the first element of the list. This is correct, but the code could be more explicit about these initializations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with all non-positive numbers.

Here is a revised version of the solution that addresses these points:

```python
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    if not nums:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # Calculate temporary values
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update the best result so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far

# Example usage
print(max_product_subarray([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(max_product_subarray([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to `nums[0]`.
   
2. **Temporary Values**:
   - We calculate `temp_max` and `temp_min` separately before updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update Logic**:
   - The `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated using the temporary values to ensure correct propagation of the minimum and maximum products.

This revised solution should correctly handle various cases, including those involving negative numbers and edge cases like an empty list or a list with only non-positive numbers.
