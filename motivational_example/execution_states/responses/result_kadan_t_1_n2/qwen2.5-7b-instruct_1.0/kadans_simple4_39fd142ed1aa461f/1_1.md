The provided solution is mostly correct and addresses the problem effectively. However, there's a small issue with how `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated within the loop. The logic should be to compare three values: the current number (`num`), the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`), and the product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary value which could be the new max or min ending here
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are correctly tracked at each step, which helps in handling cases where the list contains negative numbers that can turn a previously small product into a large one when multiplied.

To further validate the correctness, you can test it with some sample inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Should print 6 (from subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Should print 0 (from subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4, -1]))  # Should print 24 (from subarray [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([]))              # Should print -inf
```

These tests should confirm that the function works as expected.
