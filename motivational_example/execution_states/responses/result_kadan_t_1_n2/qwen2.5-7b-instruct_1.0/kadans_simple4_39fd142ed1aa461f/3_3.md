The provided solution is mostly correct and can indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there's a small improvement that can be made to ensure clarity and correctness in edge cases.

Here's the improved version of the function with some comments for better understanding:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # If the list is empty, return negative infinity as the maximum product would be negative.
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize the variables to track the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary value which is the product of the current number and the maximum ending here.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update the maximum ending here to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary value, and the product of the current number and the minimum ending here.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the minimum ending here to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary value, and the product of the current number and the minimum ending here.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # Update the best so far if the current maximum ending here is greater than the best so far.
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Solution:
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list, we calculate three possible values:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product of the current maximum ending here and the current number.
  - `num`: This is the current number itself.
  - `min_ending_here * num`: This is the product of the current minimum ending here and the current number.
- **Update**: We update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position, respectively.
- **Track Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here`, we check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

This approach ensures that both positive and negative numbers are handled correctly, and it efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
