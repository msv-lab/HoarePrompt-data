Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf`. This is correct because an empty list does not have any sublists, and thus no product can be calculated, so returning `-inf` is appropriate.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Here, we initialize three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` to store the best (maximum) product found so far, initialized with the first element of the list.

3. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   This loop iterates through each element starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is used to temporarily store the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the following values:
     - The current number itself (`num`).
     - The temporary product (`temp`), which is the previous `max_ending_here` times the current number.
     - The product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the following values:
     - The current number itself (`num`).
     - The temporary product (`temp`), which is the previous `max_ending_here` times the current number.
     - The product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop, this condition checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than the previously stored `best_so_far`. If it is, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   Finally, the function returns the best (maximum) product found.

### Correctness Verification

The logic in the program is designed to handle both positive and negative numbers correctly. It effectively keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because negative numbers can turn a large product into a small one and vice versa. The final result will capture the highest product among all possible sublists.

### Conclusion

The given program is correct in finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
