Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Program Breakdown

1. **Initial Check for Empty List**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf`. This is correct because an empty list does not have any product, so returning `-inf` makes sense.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Here, the initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`. This is a good starting point as we will update these variables as we iterate through the list.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number `num`, the product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that even if the product of the previous elements was negative, the maximum product can still be updated.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number `num`, the product `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This ensures that even if the product of the previous elements was positive, the minimum product can still be updated.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop, this checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary. This ensures that `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest product found during the iteration.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   Finally, the function returns the `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Conclusion

The logic in the program is correct. It handles the edge case of an empty list, initializes the necessary variables correctly, and iterates through the list while updating the maximum and minimum products at each step. The final check ensures that the maximum product is returned accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
