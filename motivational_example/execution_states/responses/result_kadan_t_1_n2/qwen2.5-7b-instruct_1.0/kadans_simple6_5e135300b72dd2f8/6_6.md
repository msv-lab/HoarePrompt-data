Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why it works:

- The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the input list `xs`.
- It then iterates through the rest of the elements in the list.
- For each element, it calculates three possible products:
  - `num` (the current number itself),
  - `temp = max_ending_here * num` (the product of the current number and the maximum product ending at the previous position),
  - `min_ending_here * num` (the product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position).
- It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values, which ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of these three values, which ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- After updating these values, it checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.
- Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

This approach works because it considers both positive and negative numbers, which can flip the sign of the product and potentially lead to larger products when multiplied by a negative number. The function handles edge cases like empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`.
