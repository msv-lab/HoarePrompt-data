The provided program seems to be addressing the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is a good starting point because it allows the algorithm to consider both positive and negative numbers effectively.

2. **Iterating Through the List**: The loop starts from the second element of the list (`for num in xs[1:]`). For each element, it updates the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is the product of the current maximum ending value and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This line ensures that the `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum possible value among the current number, the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step is crucial because multiplying a large negative number by a negative number can result in a larger positive number.
   - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: Similarly, this line updates the minimum ending value considering the current number, the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Updating the Best Product**: After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Execution:

Let's test with some examples to confirm:

- **Example 1**: `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`
  - `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` would track the intermediate results and ultimately yield `6` (from the subarray `[2, 3]`).

- **Example 2**: `xs = [-2, 0, -1]`
  - Here, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` would track the intermediate results and ultimately yield `0` (since multiplying by zero will reset the product).

Given these observations, the logic of the program appears to handle both positive and negative numbers correctly and find the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct. Therefore, the answer is:
