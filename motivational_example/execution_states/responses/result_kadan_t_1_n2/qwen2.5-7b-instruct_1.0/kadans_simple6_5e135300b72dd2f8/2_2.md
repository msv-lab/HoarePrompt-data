The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description. The logic implemented in `func_1` is a dynamic programming approach that keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the array. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large positive product (and vice versa).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this solution works:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. This handles the edge case where the list has only one element.
2. **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list, calculate the new potential `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
     - The current element itself,
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current element (this considers extending the current maximum product),
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (this considers turning a negative number into a positive number).
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
     - The current element itself,
     - The product of `max_ending_here` and the current element,
     - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
3. **Update Best Result**: After updating `max_ending_here`, compare it with `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is larger.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, return `best_so_far`.

Given these points, the provided solution should correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: True
```

This solution is correct and should work for all valid input lists.
