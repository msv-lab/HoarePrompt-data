The provided program is correct. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list** starting from the second element:
   - For each number in the list, compute three possible products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents continuing the current streak of positive products.
     - `num`: This represents starting a new streak at the current number.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: This represents flipping the sign if the current number is negative (since multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative into a large positive).

3. **Update the values**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of these three possibilities.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of these three possibilities (to handle cases where we need to flip the sign due to negative numbers).

4. **Track the best result**:
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes larger than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

5. **Return** the `best_so_far` value, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

The provided solution handles both positive and negative numbers correctly, including edge cases like all numbers being negative, and it efficiently computes the maximum product in a single pass through the list.

Therefore, the answer is: **Correctness: True**
