To determine if the provided solution is correct, let's analyze the logic and test it with some example inputs.

The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given array `xs`. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
3. For each element, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the current element and the product of the current element with `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
4. Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

Now, let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -1]))   # Expected output: -1 (sublist [-1])
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```

Based on the described logic and the provided examples, the function appears to correctly handle various cases including handling empty lists, positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.

Therefore, the given solution seems to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
