The provided solution appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The logic used in the function is consistent with the Kadane's algorithm variation tailored for finding the maximum product subarray.

Let's verify this step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. This setup ensures that the algorithm can handle negative numbers effectively.
2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates:
   - `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
3. **Updating Best Product**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.
4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`.

Here is the provided solution with some additional comments for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Handle empty list case
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temp as the product of max_ending_here and the current number
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to the maximum of the current number, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of the current number, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and the current number
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Given this analysis, the solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
