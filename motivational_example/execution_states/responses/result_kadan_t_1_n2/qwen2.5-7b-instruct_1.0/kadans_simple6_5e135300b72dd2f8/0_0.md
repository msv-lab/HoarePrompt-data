To determine if the provided solution is correct, let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # This line should be corrected from 'max' to 'min'
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # This line should be corrected from 'min' to 'max'
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The issues are with the lines where `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated. The logic for updating these variables needs to consider both the current number and the product with the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values correctly. Specifically, when considering the `max_ending_here`, we need to choose the maximum value, and similarly, for `min_ending_here`, we need to choose the minimum value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
    
    return max_ending_here if max_ending_here > best_so_far else best_so_far
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is calculated correctly by properly tracking the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.

Therefore, the initial solution provided is incorrect. The correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
