Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. The logic implemented in the function is based on the Kadane's algorithm, but adapted to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively.

Here's a brief explanation of how the function works:

- **Initialization**: It initializes three variables:
  - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position (this is needed to handle negative numbers that can turn a large negative product into a large positive product).
  - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` to store the best (maximum) product found so far.

- **Iteration**: For each number in the list (starting from the second element), it calculates:
  - `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.
  - Updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.

- **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

This approach ensures that even when the list contains negative numbers, the maximum product can still be accurately calculated by considering the effect of multiplying by a negative number (which can change the sign and potentially increase the product).

Therefore, the given program is correct for solving the problem.
