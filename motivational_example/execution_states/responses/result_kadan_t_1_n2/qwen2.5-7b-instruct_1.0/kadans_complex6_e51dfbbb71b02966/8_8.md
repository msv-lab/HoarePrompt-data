Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`). This helps in determining the new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp` (the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After iterating through all elements, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that even when the list contains negative numbers, the algorithm can still find the maximum product by considering both positive and negative products at each step.

Therefore, the solution provided is correct.
