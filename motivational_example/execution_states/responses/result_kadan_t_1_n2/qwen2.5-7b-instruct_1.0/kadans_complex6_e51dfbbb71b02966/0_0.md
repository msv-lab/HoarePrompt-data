Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a previously minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the code calculates three possible products:
     - The current element itself.
     - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
     - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on these three values.
   - This ensures that `max_ending_here` always contains the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position, considering both positive and negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and works efficiently for finding the maximum product of any sublist.
