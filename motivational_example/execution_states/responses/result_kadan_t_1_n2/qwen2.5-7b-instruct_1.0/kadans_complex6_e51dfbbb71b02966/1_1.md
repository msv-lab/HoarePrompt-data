Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The logic used in the function is based on Kadane's algorithm, adapted for finding the maximum product instead of the maximum sum.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`.
2. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
3. **Iterative Update**: For each subsequent element in the list, the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum and minimum products that can be obtained by including the current element. This helps in handling negative numbers which can turn large negative products into large positive ones.
4. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and will work as intended for the problem described.
