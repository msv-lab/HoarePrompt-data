Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The logic used is efficient and works well for handling edge cases, such as when the list contains negative numbers or zeros. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates the potential new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - The value of `max_ending_here` is updated based on three possibilities: the current number itself, the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number, or the product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number. This handles both positive and negative numbers effectively.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated based on the same three possibilities but focusing on minimizing the product.

3. **Update Best Product**:
   - After processing each number, the code updates `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered, and the solution is optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
