Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both set to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).
   - `best_so_far` also set to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`).

2. **Iterating through the List**: For each subsequent element in the list, the function calculates:
   - `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` as the maximum of three values: the current element (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (`num`).
   - `min_ending_here` as the minimum of three values: the current element (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (`num`).

3. **Updating the Best So Far**: After calculating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles cases where negative numbers are present in the list, as the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by another negative number. The function also correctly handles an empty list by returning `-inf`. Therefore, the given solution is correct.
