To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first understand what it does and then analyze its logic.

### Program Analysis

The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the given list `xs`. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current maximum product ending here and the current number.
     - Updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current number itself,
       - `temp` (product with the previous maximum),
       - `min_ending_here * num` (product with the previous minimum).
     - Updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current number itself,
       - `temp`,
       - `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if it is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

### Reasoning

The approach taken in this program is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, but adapted for the maximum product subarray problem. It correctly handles both positive and negative numbers because the minimum product can turn into a maximum when multiplied by a negative number, and vice versa.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - If the list is empty, it correctly returns `-inf`.
  - It correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to handle the transition between positive and negative products.
  - It maintains `best_so_far` to keep track of the maximum product found.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in the given list. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
