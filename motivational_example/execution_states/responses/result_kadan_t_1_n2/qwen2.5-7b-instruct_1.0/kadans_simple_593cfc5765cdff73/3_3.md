Let's reason through the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element, as it will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - For each element `num` in the list (starting from the second element), the program calculates three potential values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - The new value for `max_ending_here` is set to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - The new value for `min_ending_here` is set to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`:**
   - After each iteration, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

### Analysis:

The key idea behind this approach is that at any point in the list, you need to consider both the maximum and minimum products ending at that point because negative numbers can turn large negative products into large positive products (and vice versa).

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - If the current number `num` is negative, multiplying it with the current `max_ending_here` could result in a smaller number, while multiplying it with `min_ending_here` could result in a larger number (since `min_ending_here` might be negative).
  - Similarly, if `num` is positive, multiplying it with `min_ending_here` will still keep it as a potential candidate for the maximum product.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles an empty list by returning `float('-inf')`.
  - It iterates through all elements of the list, ensuring that all possible sublists are considered.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. It properly accounts for both positive and negative numbers and ensures that all elements are processed.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
