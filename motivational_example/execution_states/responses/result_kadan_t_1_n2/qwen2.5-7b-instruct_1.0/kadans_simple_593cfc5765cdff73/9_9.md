Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description
- Given a list of integers (`xs`), we need to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.

### Code Analysis
1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function correctly returns `float('-inf')`, indicating no valid product can be calculated.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list. This is a good start since they help track the minimum and maximum product ending at each position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element, which will keep track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is used to store the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`. This helps handle scenarios where multiplying with a negative number could turn a large negative into a large positive.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number itself, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`. This ensures that even if the current number is negative, the maximum product is still tracked correctly.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number itself, the product of the current number with `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After processing all elements, the final `best_so_far` value is returned, ensuring it contains the maximum product found throughout the iteration.

### Reasoning
The algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and maintains the necessary state variables (`min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far`) to track the maximum product. It accounts for the possibility of a negative number turning a previously small negative product into a large positive one, thus finding the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
