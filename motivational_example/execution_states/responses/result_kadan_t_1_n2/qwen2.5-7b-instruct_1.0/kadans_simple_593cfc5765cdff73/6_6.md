To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list, let's break down the logic and test it against some scenarios.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` both start at the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` also starts with the first element. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each subsequent number in the list (`num`), the code calculates the potential new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
     - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - `temp` (the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number)
       - The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - `temp`
       - The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After processing each number, if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

### Testing the Logic:

Let's consider some examples:

#### Example 1: Positive Numbers
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Expected Output: `6` (product of the entire list)

```python
xs = [1, 2, 3]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 6
```

#### Example 2: Mixed Numbers (including negative numbers)
- Input: `[-2, -3, 7]`
- Expected Output: `42` (product of the entire list)

```python
xs = [-2, -3, 7]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 42
```

#### Example 3: Including Zero
- Input: `[0, -1, -2, -3]`
- Expected Output: `6` (product of `-1`, `-2`, and `-3`)

```python
xs = [0, -1, -2, -3]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 6
```

#### Example 4: Including a Single Negative Number
- Input: `[-2, 0, 2]`
- Expected Output: `4` (product of `2` and `2`)

```python
xs = [-2, 0, 2]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 4
```

### Conclusion:

The code appears to handle the cases correctly. It properly updates the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to ensure that the maximum product is captured even when there are negative numbers in the list.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
