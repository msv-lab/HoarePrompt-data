The provided solution is correct. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Here's a brief explanation of why it works:

- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
- **Iterating through the list**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the function calculates three values:
  - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This represents the product if we continue the current subarray that ends at the previous element.
  - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the product continuing the previous subarray, or starting a new subarray from the current number.
  - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the product continuing the previous subarray, or starting a new subarray from the current number.
- **Updating the best result**: If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then update `best_so_far`.
- **Return the best result**: Finally, return `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that the function considers both positive and negative numbers, which can affect the maximum product significantly. For example, multiplying a large negative number by another negative number can yield a large positive product.

So, the correctness of the solution is:

Correctness: **True**
