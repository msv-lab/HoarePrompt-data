Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

The problem is to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The provided solution uses dynamic programming with two variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here is the given code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list starting from the second element:**
   - For each element `num`, we compute three possible values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`

3. **Update the best so far:**
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Negative Numbers:**
  - The logic correctly handles negative numbers by maintaining both a maximum and minimum product ending at each position. This allows the algorithm to account for the potential flip from negative to positive when multiplying by a negative number.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - An empty list is handled by returning `-inf`.
  - Single-element lists are handled by returning that single element as the maximum product.

- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For an input like `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the algorithm should correctly identify the maximum product as `6` (from the sublist `[2, 3]`).
  - For an input like `[-2, 0, -1]`, the algorithm should correctly identify the maximum product as `0` (since including `0` in any product makes it zero).

### Conclusion

The provided solution appears to be correct and works as intended. It handles all edge cases and correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True**
