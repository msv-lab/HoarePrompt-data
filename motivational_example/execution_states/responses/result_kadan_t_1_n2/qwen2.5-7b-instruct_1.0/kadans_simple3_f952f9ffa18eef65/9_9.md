Let's analyze the provided solution to see if it correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is known as the Kadane's algorithm with modifications to handle negative numbers effectively. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list, update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`:
     - `temp` is the product of the current number and `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This helps in handling negative numbers that can turn a large negative product into a large positive one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Update `best_so_far`**:
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

This approach ensures that both the largest and smallest products (due to potential negative numbers) are considered at each step.

### Testing the Solution

Let's test the function with some sample inputs to verify its correctness:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-1, -3, -10, 0, 60]))  # Expected output: 60 (sublist [60])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 0, -2, -40]))  # Expected output: 80 (sublist [-2, -40])
print(func_1([]))  # Expected output: -inf
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-1, -2, -3, -4])
```

### Conclusion

Based on the logic and the test cases, the provided solution appears to be correct. It handles various edge cases such as empty lists, lists with negative numbers, and lists with zeros.

**Correctness:** True
