Let's analyze the provided Python function to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position. This approach is necessary because the maximum product can come from either continuing a previous maximum or minimum product (if the current number is negative) or starting anew with the current number.

Here is the breakdown of the logic:

- `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

The loop iterates through the list, updating these variables based on the current element and the products formed with the previous elements.

Let's test this with a few examples:

### Example 1:
```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```
- Initial values:
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- After processing `3`:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = 6`

- After processing `-2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = 6`

- After processing `4`:
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -8`
  - `best_so_far = 6`

The final value of `best_so_far` is `6`, which is correct.

### Example 2:
```python
xs = [-2, 0, -1]
```
- Initial values:
  - `min_ending_here = -2`
  - `max_ending_here = -2`
  - `best_so_far = -2`

- After processing `0`:
  - `temp = -2 * 0 = 0`
  - `max_ending_here = max(0, 0, -2 * 0) = 0`
  - `min_ending_here = min(0, 0, -2 * 0) = 0`
  - `best_so_far = 0`

- After processing `-1`:
  - `temp = 0 * -1 = 0`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-1, 0, 0 * -1) = 0`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-1, 0, 0 * -1) = -1`
  - `best_so_far = 0`

The final value of `best_so_far` is `0`, which is correct.

Based on the analysis and examples, the provided function appears to be correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
