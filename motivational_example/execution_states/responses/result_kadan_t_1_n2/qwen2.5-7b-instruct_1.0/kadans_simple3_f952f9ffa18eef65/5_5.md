Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

The problem requires handling both positive and negative numbers because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied with another negative number.

Here's the function again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of:
       - The current element (`num`).
       - The temporary product (`temp`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of:
       - The current element (`num`).
       - The temporary product (`temp`).
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and the current element (`min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

### Correctness:

This approach is indeed correct. The idea is to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a previously smallest product (which was negative) into a large positive product. By maintaining both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the algorithm correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
