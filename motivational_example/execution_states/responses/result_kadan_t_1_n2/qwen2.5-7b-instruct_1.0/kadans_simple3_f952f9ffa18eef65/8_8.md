Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Analysis

The function uses a dynamic programming approach with three variables:
- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far`: The best (maximum) product found so far.

The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
3. For each element, update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` considering the following cases:
   - The current element itself.
   - The product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
   - The product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

4. Update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

This approach works because:
- It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively.
- It keeps track of the minimum product ending at each position, which helps in handling cases where a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large negative one and vice versa.

### Test Cases

To verify correctness, let's test the function with some sample inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Expected output: 24
print(func_1([]))             # Expected output: -inf
```

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the expected outputs, the provided function appears to be correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
