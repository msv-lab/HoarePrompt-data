The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. Let's break down the logic to understand how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This variable keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This variable keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This variable stores the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is the potential product if the current number is multiplied with the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (`num`), the temporary value (`temp`), and the product of the minimum product ending at the previous position (`min_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current number (`num`), the temporary value (`temp`), and the product of the minimum product ending at the previous position (`min_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).

3. **Update the best-so-far maximum product**:
   - If the newly calculated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Test Cases

Let's test the function with some example inputs to verify its correctness:

```python
# Test cases
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([0, 2]))         # Output: 2 (sublist [2])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0]))# Output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2, -3])
```

Based on the described logic and the example test cases, the function `func_1` should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist. The solution handles various edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and single-element lists appropriately.
