The provided Python function `func_1` appears to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the input list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, as this is the best product we know of initially.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each subsequent element in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates the potential new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
    - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current element (`num`) with the previous `max_ending_here`.
    - The new `max_ending_here` is then set to the maximum of three values: the current element itself (`num`), the `temp` value, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`. This ensures that if the previous minimum product was negative, it can turn into a large positive number when multiplied by a negative current element.
    - Similarly, the new `min_ending_here` is set to the minimum of three values: the current element itself (`num`), the `temp` value, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.

- **Update Best Product**:
  - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

- **Return Result**:
  - Finally, return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Test Cases

Let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Expected output: 24 (sublist [-1, -2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([]))            # Expected output: -inf
```

These test cases should validate the correctness of the function.

### Conclusion

Based on the explanation and the test cases, the provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
