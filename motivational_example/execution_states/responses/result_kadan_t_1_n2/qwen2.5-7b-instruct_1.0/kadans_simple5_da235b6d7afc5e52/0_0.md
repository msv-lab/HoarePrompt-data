The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down the logic to ensure it works as expected.

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which will store the best (maximum) product found so far.

- **Iterate through the list**:
  - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the code calculates three potential values:
    - `temp`: This is the product of the current maximum ending here (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
    - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum ending here (`min_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`). This step considers the possibility that a negative number might turn a small positive product into a large one.
    - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum ending here (`min_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`). This step ensures we can still get the maximum product even if the numbers become negative.

- **Update the best product**:
  - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

- **Return the result**:
  - Finally, return `best_so_far` as the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Test Cases:

Let's test the function with a few example cases to ensure it works correctly:

```python
# Example 1: Normal case with positive and negative numbers
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6 (from the sublist [2, 3])

# Example 2: All negative numbers
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output should be 12 (from the sublist [-1, -2, -3, -4])

# Example 3: Single element
print(func_1([1]))  # Output should be 1

# Example 4: Empty list
print(func_1([]))  # Output should be -inf

# Example 5: List with zero
print(func_1([0, 2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6 (from the sublist [2, 3])
```

Running these test cases will help verify that the function works as intended.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution seems correct and should handle various edge cases including lists with zeros, negative numbers, and positive numbers.
