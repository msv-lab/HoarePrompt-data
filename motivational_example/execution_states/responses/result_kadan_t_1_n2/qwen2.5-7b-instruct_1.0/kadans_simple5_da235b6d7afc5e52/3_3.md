The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity) because there are no elements to form a product.

2. **Dynamic Programming Variables**:
   - `min_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a small positive number can result in a larger negative product, which might still be part of the largest product when multiplied by subsequent numbers.
   - `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: This variable stores the overall best product found so far.

3. **Iteration**: The function iterates through each element in the list starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it calculates the following:
   - `temp`: This is the product of the current element with the maximum product ending at the previous position (`max_ending_here`).
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` based on the following logic:
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This is necessary to handle cases where the current element or its product with `min_ending_here` results in a smaller product.

4. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

### Example

Let's consider an example list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Starting with `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, and `best_so_far = 2`.
- Iterating through the list:
  - For `num = 3`: `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
    - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
    - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - For `num = -2`: `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
    - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6`
    - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - For `num = 4`: `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
    - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
    - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`
- The final `best_so_far` is `24`.

Therefore, the function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and finds the maximum product of any sublist.

In conclusion, the provided solution is correct and effectively solves the problem.
