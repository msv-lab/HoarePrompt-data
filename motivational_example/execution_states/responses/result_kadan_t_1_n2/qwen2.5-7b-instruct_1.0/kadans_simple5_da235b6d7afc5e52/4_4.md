The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's break down how it works:

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a small negative number can result in a large positive number.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), we calculate:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, we update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, indicating no valid product.

### Example:
Let's consider an example list: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

- Initial values: 
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- Iterating through the list:
  - For `num = 3`:
    - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
    - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
    - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
    - Update `best_so_far` to 6.

  - For `num = -2`:
    - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
    - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 3 * -2 = -6`
    - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
    - No update to `best_so_far` as 6 > -6.

  - For `num = 4`:
    - `temp = -6 * 4 = -24`
    - `max_ending_here = max(4, -24, -12 * 4) = 4`
    - `min_ending_here = min(4, -24, -12 * 4) = -24`
    - Update `best_so_far` to 4.

The final value of `best_so_far` is 6, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist. It handles both positive and negative numbers effectively, ensuring that the algorithm finds the optimal solution even when the list contains negative numbers.
