Yes, the provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the input list `xs`. This is necessary because we need to start tracking the maximum and minimum products that can be formed ending at each position.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function then iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates the potential new maximum and minimum products that can be formed by extending the current subarray:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is the product if the current number continues the existing maximum product subarray.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates the maximum product that can be formed ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates the minimum product that can be formed ending at the current position.

3. **Updating the Best Result**:
   - After updating the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position, the function checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach works because it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is crucial because a negative number multiplied by a very small (negative or positive) number can become a large positive number, which could potentially be the maximum product. Thus, the algorithm maintains both possibilities (positive and negative products) to ensure it finds the correct maximum product.

Here is the code again for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The function should correctly handle all cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros.
