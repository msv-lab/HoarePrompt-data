The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works to ensure its correctness.

### Explanation

The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to keep track of two states for each element in the list:
- `max_ending_here`: The maximum product ending at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: The minimum product ending at the current position.

These values are crucial because a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative product, and vice versa. By keeping track of both, we can handle such cases correctly.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list (`num`), calculate the temporary product with the previous `max_ending_here`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` as the maximum of three possible values:
     - The current element (`num`).
     - The temporary product (`temp`).
     - The product of the current element with the minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here * num`).
   - Update `min_ending_here` as the minimum of three possible values:
     - The current element (`num`).
     - The temporary product (`temp`).
     - The product of the current element with the maximum product ending here (`max_ending_here * num`).

3. **Tracking the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` which will be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Usage

Let's consider an example to see how this works:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(func_1(xs))  # Output: 6
```

In this example:
- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, and `best_so_far = 2`.
- After processing `3`, `max_ending_here` becomes `6` (since `3 * 2` is larger than `3`).
- After processing `-2`, `min_ending_here` becomes `-12` (since `-2 * 6` is smaller than `-2`), and `max_ending_here` becomes `12` (since `-2 * -12` is larger than `-2`).
- After processing `4`, `max_ending_here` becomes `48` (since `4 * 12` is larger than `4`).

Thus, the function correctly returns `48` as the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers and ensures that the maximum product is tracked correctly.
