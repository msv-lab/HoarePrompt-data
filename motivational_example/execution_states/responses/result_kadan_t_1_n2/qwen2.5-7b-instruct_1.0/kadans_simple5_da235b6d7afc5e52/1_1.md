The provided solution does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down the logic to understand why this works:

### Problem Explanation:
Given a list of integers, the goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist).

### Solution Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each number in the list starting from the second element:
    - We calculate three potential products: the current number itself (`num`), the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number (`temp`), and the product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number.
    - We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three values because a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large one or vice versa.
    - Similarly, we update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of these three values to handle cases where the product becomes very negative.
    - If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, we update `best_so_far`.

- **Return**:
  - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example:
Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initially, `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, and `best_so_far = 2`.
- After processing `3`:
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far` remains `2`.
- After processing `-2`:
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = 6` (note that using `min_ending_here * -2` would give `-6`, but since we already have a larger value in `max_ending_here`, it remains unchanged)
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far` remains `2`.
- After processing `4`:
  - `temp = 6 * 4 = 24`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, 24, -12 * 4) = 24`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, 24, -12 * 4) = -48`
  - `best_so_far` is now `24`.

Thus, the function correctly identifies `24` as the maximum product of any sublist.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python code effectively solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. It handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately and ensures that the maximum product is tracked throughout the iteration.
