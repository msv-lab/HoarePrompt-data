The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the input list `xs`.

2. **Iterate through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (index 1), the function performs the following steps:
     - It calculates a temporary value `temp` which is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
       - The current element `num`,
       - The temporary value `temp`, and
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
       - The current element `num`,
       - The temporary value `temp`, and
       - The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update the best product**:
   - After processing each element, it checks if the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product found.

### Explanation of Logic

- The idea behind this algorithm is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- By maintaining these two values (`max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`), the function can handle cases where a large negative product could lead to a larger positive product when multiplied by another negative number.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the input list `[-2, 0, -1, 3, 5]`:
- Initialize: `min_ending_here = -2`, `max_ending_here = -2`, `best_so_far = -2`
- First iteration (`num = 0`):
  - `temp = -2 * 0 = 0`
  - `max_ending_here = max(0, -2, -2 * 0) = 0`
  - `min_ending_here = min(0, -2, -2 * 0) = 0`
  - Update: `best_so_far = 0`
- Second iteration (`num = -1`):
  - `temp = 0 * -1 = 0`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-1, 0, 0 * -1) = -1`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-1, 0, 0 * -1) = -1`
  - Update: `best_so_far = 0`
- Third iteration (`num = 3`):
  - `temp = -1 * 3 = -3`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, -3, -1 * 3) = 3`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, -3, -1 * 3) = -3`
  - Update: `best_so_far = 3`
- Fourth iteration (`num = 5`):
  - `temp = 3 * 5 = 15`
  - `max_ending_here = max(5, 15, -3 * 5) = 15`
  - `min_ending_here = min(5, 15, -3 * 5) = -15`
  - Update: `best_so_far = 15`

The function correctly identifies that the maximum product of any sublist is `15` for the given input list.

Therefore, the provided solution effectively solves the problem.
