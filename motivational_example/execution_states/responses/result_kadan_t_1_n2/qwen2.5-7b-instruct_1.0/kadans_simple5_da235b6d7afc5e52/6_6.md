The provided solution does correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The algorithm used is a variation of Kadane's algorithm, but it's modified to handle both positive and negative numbers effectively.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, the code calculates three possible values:
     - `num`: The current number.
     - `temp`: The product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: The product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Check for new best**:
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`.

### Example

For the input list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` start at `2`.
- After processing `3`, `max_ending_here` becomes `6` (since `3 * 2` is greater than `3` and `-2 * 2`).
- After processing `-2`, `max_ending_here` becomes `12` (since `-2 * 3` is greater than `-2` and `-2 * 6` is less than `-2`).
- After processing `4`, `max_ending_here` becomes `48` (since `4 * 12` is greater than `4` and `-2 * 12` is less than `4`).

Thus, the function correctly returns `48`, which is the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases

The solution handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`. It also handles lists with all negative numbers or a mix of positive and negative numbers correctly.

In summary, the provided solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
