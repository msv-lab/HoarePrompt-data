Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

Here's a brief explanation of how the code works:

1. It first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `-inf` as specified.

2. It initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` to store the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. It iterates through the list starting from the second element:
   - For each element, it calculates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

4. After the loop, it checks if the `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach effectively handles cases where there might be negative numbers in the list, which can turn a small positive product into a large negative one when multiplied, and vice versa. Therefore, the logic is sound and the implementation is correct.
