Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`. This is because the maximum product could be as simple as the first element itself.

2. **Iteration**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
   - `temp` is calculated as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is found. The program logic ensures that even if there are negative numbers in the list, they can flip the sign of the product, potentially leading to a larger (more positive) product when multiplied by other numbers.

Thus, the program is correct for the described problem.
