Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the given states. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `-inf` (negative infinity).

2. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Iterating Through List**: The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element. For each element, it updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to keep track of the minimum and maximum products of subarrays that end at the current position.

4. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The variable `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the best-so-far maximum product.

The logic within the loop ensures that the algorithm considers both positive and negative numbers appropriately, which is crucial for finding the maximum product of any sublist. The approach used is similar to Kadane's algorithm but adapted to handle products instead of sums.

Thus, the program correctly implements the solution for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
