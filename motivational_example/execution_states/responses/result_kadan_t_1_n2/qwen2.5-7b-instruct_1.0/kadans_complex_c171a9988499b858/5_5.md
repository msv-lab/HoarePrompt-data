The given Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. The program aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the correctness of the program:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of `xs`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the program calculates three values:
     - `temp`: This is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

Given this analysis, the program should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the input list of integers. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
