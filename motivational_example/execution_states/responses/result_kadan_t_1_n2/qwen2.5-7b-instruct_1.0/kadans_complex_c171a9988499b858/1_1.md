The given Python program is **Correct**. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `-inf`. This is correct because the product of any sublist in an empty list cannot be computed.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are used to track the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at each position.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product that can be obtained ending at the current element.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product that can be obtained ending at the current element.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far across all sublists.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - For each number in the list, the logic updates `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` considering three possibilities:
     - Starting a new sublist from the current number.
     - Extending the current maximum product sublist.
     - Extending the current minimum product sublist (because multiplying by a negative number can turn a minimum into a maximum).
   - The condition `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :` correctly updates `best_so_far` whenever a better product is found.

4. **Final Return:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist after processing the entire list.

Given these points, the annotated comments in the code align with the logic and ensure the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the given program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.
