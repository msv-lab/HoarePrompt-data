Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided comments. The logic implemented in the function `func_1(xs)` correctly finds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input list `xs`.

Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list `xs`. This ensures that even if the list contains only one element, the function can still return the correct result.

2. **Iterating through the List**: For each element in the list starting from the second element, the program calculates the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element. This is done using the variables `temp`, `max_ending_here`, and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating the Best Product**: After calculating the products for the current element, the program updates `best_so_far` if the `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray found during the iteration.

This approach correctly handles various edge cases, including negative numbers and zeros, ensuring that the solution is robust. Therefore, the provided Python code is correct.
