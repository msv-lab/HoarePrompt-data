Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1` is correctly implemented to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list. This is a reasonable choice because, at the start, there's no previous element to compare with.

2. **Iteration through the List**:
   - For each element in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates three potential products:
     - `num`: the current number.
     - `max_ending_here * num`: the product of the current number and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: the product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of these three products. This is crucial because the maximum product can either come from continuing the previous maximum product, starting fresh with the current number, or turning the current number into a new minimum product if it's negative.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of these three products, ensuring that even if the current number is negative, the minimum product is considered.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product found during the iteration.

This approach effectively handles both positive and negative numbers, including cases where negative numbers contribute positively to the product due to their multiplication with other negative numbers. The function also correctly handles empty lists by returning negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).

Thus, the provided solution is correct and efficient for solving the problem.
