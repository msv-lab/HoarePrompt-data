Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The given program `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`. Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (i.e., `xs[1:]`):
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing each element, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found in the list.

This approach works because it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

- Initialization:
  - `min_ending_here = 2`
  - `max_ending_here = 2`
  - `best_so_far = 2`

- Iteration through the list:
  - For `num = 3`:
    - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
    - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
    - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
    - `best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6`
  
  - For `num = -2`:
    - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
    - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`
    - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
    - `best_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6`
  
  - For `num = 4`:
    - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
    - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
    - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
    - `best_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6`

The final result is `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist (`2 * 3 * -2 * 4 = 24`).

Thus, the given program is correct.
