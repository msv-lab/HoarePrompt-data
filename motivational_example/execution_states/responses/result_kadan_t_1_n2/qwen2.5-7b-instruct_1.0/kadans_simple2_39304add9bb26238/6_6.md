Correctness: True

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position, and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively.

2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates through each element of the list starting from the second element (index 1).

3. **State Update**:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This computes the product if the current number is part of the previous maximum product.
   - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number alone, the product of the current number with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product. This handles the case where multiplying by a negative number could turn a minimum product into a maximum product.
   - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates `min_ending_here` similarly but to find the minimum product.

4. **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new maximum product is better than the previously recorded `best_so_far` and updates it if necessary.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This approach ensures that the algorithm correctly accounts for both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, which could reset the product sequence. The program handles edge cases like empty lists by returning `float('-inf')`.
