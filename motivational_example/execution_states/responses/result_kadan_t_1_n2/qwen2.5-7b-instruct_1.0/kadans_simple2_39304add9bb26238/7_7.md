Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers. The logic implemented in the function is correct and follows the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it works correctly:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the following steps are performed:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the value of `max_ending_here * num`. This helps in considering the case where the previous maximum product might have been negative and multiplying with a positive number can turn it into a very large positive number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary value (`temp`), which is `max_ending_here * num`
       - The minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here * num`), which helps in handling the scenario where the current number is negative and can turn a previously large negative product into a large positive product.
     - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary value (`temp`), which is `max_ending_here * num`
       - The minimum product ending here (`min_ending_here * num`), ensuring that even if the current number is positive, it can still multiply with a large negative `min_ending_here` to become a large positive number.

3. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if it is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This algorithm correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. It ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are considered at each step, allowing it to adapt to scenarios where the product can switch between positive and negative values dynamically.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
