Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each element `num` in the list, calculate three values:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the best result**:
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the best result**:
   - Return `best_so_far`.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist:

- The key idea here is that at each step, we keep track of both the maximum and minimum product ending at the current position because a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive product (or vice versa).

- The algorithm correctly handles sequences with multiple negative numbers (which can result in a large positive product when multiplied together) and sequences with zero (which can reset the product).

- The initialization with the first element ensures that even if all elements are negative, the function still works correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution seems to correctly handle various edge cases, including sequences with zeros, negative numbers, and positive numbers.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
