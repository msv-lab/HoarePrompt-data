Correctness: True

### Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list `xs`. The logic implemented in the function is correct and follows the Kadane's algorithm variant for finding the maximum subarray product. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iteration through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Update the best product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach correctly handles cases where negative numbers are involved, ensuring that the minimum and maximum products are tracked properly. Therefore, the provided function is correct for solving the problem.
