Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the placement of the final check and update for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just after the loop ends. This is crucial because the maximum product could occur at any point during the iteration, not necessarily at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list.
