Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is almost correct but has a critical flaw in its implementation. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done within the loop, not after the loop. This is because `best_so_far` needs to track the maximum product found so far as the loop iterates through the list. If the update is done outside the loop, it will only check the final value of `max_ending_here` against the initial value of `best_so_far`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` stores the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated with the maximum product found so far, leading to the correct result.
