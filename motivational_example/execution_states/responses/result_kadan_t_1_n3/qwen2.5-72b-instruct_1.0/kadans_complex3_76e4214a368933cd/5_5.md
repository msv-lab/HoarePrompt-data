Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the final step where it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the best possible maximum product found so far after each iteration. As it stands, the `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop has completed, which could lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found up to the current element, ensuring that the function returns the correct maximum product of any sublist.
