Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist.
