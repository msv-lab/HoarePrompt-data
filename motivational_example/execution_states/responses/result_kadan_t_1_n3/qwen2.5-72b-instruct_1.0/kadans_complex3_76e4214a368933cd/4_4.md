Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, not just after the loop. This is crucial because the maximum product could be achieved at any point during the iteration, not necessarily at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
