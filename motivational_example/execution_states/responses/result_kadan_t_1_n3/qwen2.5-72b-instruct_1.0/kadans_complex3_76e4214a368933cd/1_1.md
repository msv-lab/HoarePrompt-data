Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the loop structure and the final update of `best_so_far`. The issue is that the final check and update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is updated at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `best_so_far` variable is updated within the loop to reflect the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist.
