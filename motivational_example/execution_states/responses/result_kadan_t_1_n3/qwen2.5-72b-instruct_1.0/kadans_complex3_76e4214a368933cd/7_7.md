Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the placement of the final comparison and update of `best_so_far`. The update should be done inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list, not just at the end. This is crucial because the maximum product can occur at any point in the list, and the current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which might miss the actual maximum product if it occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` inside the loop.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the maximum product is correctly identified and updated throughout the entire list.
