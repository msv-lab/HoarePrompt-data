Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the way it updates `best_so_far`. The issue is that the update to `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop, not outside. This is because `best_so_far` needs to track the maximum product found so far throughout the entire list, and not just at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far, as it is updated within the loop.
