Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the final check and update of `best_so_far`. The issue lies in the fact that the update to `best_so_far` should be done within the loop, not after it. This is because the maximum product could occur at any point during the iteration over the list, and the current implementation only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found at each step. This ensures that the function correctly returns the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
