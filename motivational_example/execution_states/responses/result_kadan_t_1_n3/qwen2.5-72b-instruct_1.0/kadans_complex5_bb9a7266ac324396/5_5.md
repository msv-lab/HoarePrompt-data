The provided solution is mostly correct but has a minor flaw in its logic that could affect the final result. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `best_so_far` variable is updated and maintained throughout the loop. The current implementation updates `best_so_far` only after the loop has completed, which means it doesn't capture the maximum product found during the iterations if it occurs before the last element.

To fix this, the `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)  # Update best_so_far inside the loop

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the highest product found so far.
- **Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This correction ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list.
