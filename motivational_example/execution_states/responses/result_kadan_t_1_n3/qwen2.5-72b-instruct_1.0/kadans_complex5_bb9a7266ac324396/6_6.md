The provided solution is mostly correct, but there's a small issue in the logic that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The key change is moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product of any sublist seen so far, rather than just the maximum product of the last sublist.

### Corrected Execution States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty.
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
- **Final State**: `xs` remains the same, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`, and `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This corrected version will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
