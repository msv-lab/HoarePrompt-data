The provided solution to the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from a list of integers is mostly correct, but there is a logical error in the final part of the function that could affect the result. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure that it captures the highest value seen so far. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which might miss the actual maximum product if it occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the list `xs` is empty and returns `-inf` if it is. This handles the edge case where the input list is empty.
2. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position and the best product found so far, respectively.
3. **Loop Through Elements**: The function iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element:
   - It calculates the temporary product `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
   - It updates `min_ending_here` similarly to keep track of the minimum product.
   - It updates `best_so_far` to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the best product found so far.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the entire list, not just at the end.
