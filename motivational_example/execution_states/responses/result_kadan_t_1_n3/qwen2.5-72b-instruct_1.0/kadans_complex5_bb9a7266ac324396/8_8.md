The provided solution for finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the placement of the final check and update for `best_so_far`. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop has completed, which means it only checks the last value of `max_ending_here`. This can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found earlier in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product at each step
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The key change is moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. This ensures that the maximum product found at each step is captured and updated accordingly. This is crucial because the maximum product could be found at any point in the list, not just at the end.

2. **Final State Comments**: The comments at the end of the loop have been updated to reflect the correct state of variables after each iteration.

### Correctness:
- **Base Case**: If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf` because the product of an empty sublist is undefined.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
- **Loop Invariant**: During each iteration, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to reflect the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at the current element. This accounts for the possibility of negative numbers changing the sign of the product.
- **Final Check**: By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function ensures that the maximum product found at any point is stored and returned.

This corrected implementation should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
