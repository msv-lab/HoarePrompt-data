The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The function works by maintaining two variables, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, to track the maximum and minimum products that can be achieved up to the current point in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Let's break down the function and verify its correctness step-by-step:

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` (negative infinity). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` ensures that it will never be chosen as the maximum product in any valid context.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element list are the element itself.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product that can be achieved up to the current element.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product that can be achieved up to the current element.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly. This ensures that `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found so far.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Correctness Verification

- **Handling Empty List:** The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list.
- **Initialization:** The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are correctly set to the first element of the list.
- **Dynamic Programming Logic:** The logic inside the loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
- **Final Check:** The final check to update `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct. It correctly handles all edge cases and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers. The state comments accurately describe the state of the variables at each step of the function.
