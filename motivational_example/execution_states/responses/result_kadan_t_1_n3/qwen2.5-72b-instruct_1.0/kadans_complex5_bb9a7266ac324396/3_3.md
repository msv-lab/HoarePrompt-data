The solution provided is almost correct but has a small issue with the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. The update should be done within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is tracked correctly through each iteration. Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to track the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The original code only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product found during the iterations. By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that the maximum product is correctly tracked.

### Example Usage:
```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 6 (from subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0 (from subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output: 24 (from subarray [-2, 3, -4])
```

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
