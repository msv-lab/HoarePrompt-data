The solution provided is almost correct but has a minor issue in the loop that needs to be addressed. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to capture the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The key change is moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step to reflect the maximum product found so far.

### Correctness:
- **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions set `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
- **Loop Invariants**:
  - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current element.
  - `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
- **Final Result**: After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

This corrected version should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
