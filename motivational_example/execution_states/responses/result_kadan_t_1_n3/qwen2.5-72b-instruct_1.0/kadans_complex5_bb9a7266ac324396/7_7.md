The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers `xs`. The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products that can be achieved up to each position in the list, considering the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` because the product of an empty list is undefined in this context, and `-inf` represents the worst possible product.
   - If the list is not empty, it initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far, initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element and the previous minimum product.
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, and the function can handle cases where the product flips due to negative numbers.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness of the Solution

The solution is generally correct and follows a well-known approach for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of a sublist. However, there is a minor issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

- **Final Update of `best_so_far`**:
  - The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop, not after the loop. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which might miss some potential maximum products found during the iteration.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Update Inside the Loop**: By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function ensures that the maximum product found at each step is considered, not just the final one.

### Conclusion

The original solution was almost correct but had a minor flaw in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The corrected version should work correctly for all test cases.
