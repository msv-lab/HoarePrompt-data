The solution provided is almost correct but has a minor issue in the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is always updated with the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates through each element starting from the second element.
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` within the loop.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
