The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the function step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.
   - These are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a small product into a large one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we track the smallest product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly handles an empty list by returning `-inf`, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Initialization**: Initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list is correct.
- **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: The logic for updating these variables is correct. It considers the current number, the product with the previous maximum, and the product with the previous minimum, which covers all possible scenarios.
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: The final check to update `best_so_far` is unnecessary because `best_so_far` is already being updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` changes.

### Simplified and Corrected Version

Here is a slightly simplified version of the function, removing the redundant check:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original solution is mostly correct but can be simplified. The simplified version provided above is more concise and maintains the same functionality. Both versions will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
