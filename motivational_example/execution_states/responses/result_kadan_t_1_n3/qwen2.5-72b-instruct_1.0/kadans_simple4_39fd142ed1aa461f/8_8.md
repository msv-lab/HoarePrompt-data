The provided solution is mostly correct but has a small issue in the logic for updating `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum value at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`).
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
     - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After processing all elements, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found so far, and it is updated correctly at each step of the iteration.
