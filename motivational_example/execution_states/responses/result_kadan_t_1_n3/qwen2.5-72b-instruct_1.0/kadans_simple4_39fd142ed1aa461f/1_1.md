The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
- **Input**: A list of integers.
- **Output**: The maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the input list.

### Key Points in the Solution
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying `max_ending_here` with `num`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - It updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - Finally, it updates `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Potential Issues
- **Update of `best_so_far`**: The update of `best_so_far` should happen inside the loop, not after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` captures the maximum product found at each step.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Initialization**: No changes needed.
- **Loop**: The update of `best_so_far` is moved inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step.

### Testing
To verify the correctness, let's test the function with some sample inputs:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, 7]))    # Expected output: 42 (sublist [-2, -3, 7])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 4]))  # Expected output: 4 (sublist [4])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0])) # Expected output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2, -3])
```

### Conclusion
The corrected function `func_1` should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers. The original solution was almost correct but missed updating `best_so_far` inside the loop.
