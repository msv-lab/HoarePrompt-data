The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to determine its correctness and efficiency.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is a reasonable choice since an empty list cannot have a positive product.

   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively. `best_so_far` keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position. This handles cases where multiplying by a negative number can turn a small product into a large one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values, to handle negative products correctly.

3. **Updating the Best Product:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After each iteration, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

The algorithm correctly handles the following cases:
- **Positive Numbers:** It will find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray of positive numbers.
- **Negative Numbers:** It correctly accounts for the effect of negative numbers, especially when they appear in pairs or larger even counts, which can turn a negative product into a positive one.
- **Zeroes:** The algorithm will reset the product to zero when encountering a zero, as zero multiplied by any number is zero.

### Example Test Cases

Let's test the function with some example inputs to ensure it works as expected:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (sublist [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (sublist [0])
print(func_1([-2, -3, -4]))   # Expected output: 12 (sublist [-2, -3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 5]))  # Expected output: 5 (sublist [5])
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, 0])) # Expected output: 6 (sublist [-1, -2, -3])
```

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The logic and variable updates are appropriate for handling both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeroes.
