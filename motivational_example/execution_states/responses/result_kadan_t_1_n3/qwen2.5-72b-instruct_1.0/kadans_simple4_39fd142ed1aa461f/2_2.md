The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's analyze the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input:** A list of integers.
- **Output:** The maximum product of any contiguous subarray (sublist) within the input list.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Handling Empty List:** If the list is empty, the function should return negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) to indicate that no valid subarray exists.
2. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.
3. **Iteration:**
   - For each element in the list, update `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` considering the current element, the product with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product with the previous `min_ending_here`.
4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Correctness:
1. **Handling Empty List:**
   - The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` if the list is empty.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list, which is appropriate.

3. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

### Potential Improvement:
- The final check `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` is unnecessary because `best_so_far` is already being updated inside the loop. This check can be removed without affecting the correctness of the function.

### Final Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This function is correct and efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
