The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness.

### Logic Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.
   - These are initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number itself might be greater than the product, or the product of the current number with the previous minimum product (in case of negative numbers).
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we track the minimum product, which is important for handling negative numbers.
     - If the updated `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

3. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` as the result.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there is no product to compute.
- **Handling Single Element**: The function correctly initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element, which is correct.
- **Handling Positive and Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers by considering the product of the current number with both the maximum and minimum products found so far. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa.
- **Updating Best So Far**: The function updates `best_so_far` only once at the end, which is a minor issue. It should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step.

### Suggested Improvement

To ensure that `best_so_far` is updated correctly at each step, move the update inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original solution is mostly correct but has a minor issue with updating `best_so_far`. The suggested improvement ensures that the maximum product is correctly tracked throughout the iteration. With this change, the function should work correctly for all test cases.
