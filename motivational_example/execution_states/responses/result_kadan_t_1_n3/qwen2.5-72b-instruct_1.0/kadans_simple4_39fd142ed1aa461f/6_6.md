The provided solution is almost correct but has a small flaw that could affect its accuracy. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is calculated as the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current maximum product and the current number, and the product of the current minimum product and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of these values to handle negative numbers correctly.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and the new `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This ensures that the function correctly handles cases with negative numbers and updates the best result found so far within the loop.
