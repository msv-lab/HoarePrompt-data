Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist (contiguous subarray) of a given list of integers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Loop Through the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.
   
3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element itself.
- **Negative Numbers**: The use of both `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the program can handle sublists with negative numbers correctly, as the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist. It handles edge cases and ensures that both positive and negative numbers are considered appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
