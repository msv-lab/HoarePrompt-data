### Reasoning

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The approach used in the function is based on dynamic programming, where we keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying `max_ending_here` with `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is correct.
- **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` is correct. It considers the current element, the product of the current element with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.
- **Update Best So Far**: The function correctly updates `best_so_far` after each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as lists with negative numbers and zeros correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
