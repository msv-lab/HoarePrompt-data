The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and reasoning behind the function to determine its correctness.

### Explanation of the Function

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Empty List**: The function correctly returns `float('-inf')` for an empty list, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Handling Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element if the list has only one element.
- **Handling Positive and Negative Numbers**: The use of both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that the function can handle cases where the list contains negative numbers. This is crucial because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which could potentially be the maximum product.
- **Updating Best So Far**: The function updates `best_so_far` correctly whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

Correctness: **True**
