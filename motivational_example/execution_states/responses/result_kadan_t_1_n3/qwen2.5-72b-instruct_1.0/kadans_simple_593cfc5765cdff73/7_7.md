### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. The approach used is dynamic programming, where we keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the overall maximum product found so far.
   - All three are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we consider the possibility of a large positive product from a previous minimum product.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we also consider the possibility of a large negative product from a previous maximum product.
     - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly update `best_so_far` inside the loop. It should be updated in every iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected code correctly updates `best_so_far` in each iteration, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist.

Thus, the original program is incorrect due to the missing update of `best_so_far` inside the loop. The corrected code is correct.
