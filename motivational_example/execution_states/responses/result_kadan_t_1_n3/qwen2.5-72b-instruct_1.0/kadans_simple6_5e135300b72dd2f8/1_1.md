Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that affects its correctness in certain scenarios. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be done within the loop, not after it. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` at the end of the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, considering the possibility of negative numbers.
- **`temp`**: This variable stores the product of the current number and the previous maximum product.
- **`max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These are updated to account for the current number, the product of the current number with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product.
- **`best_so_far`**: This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far. It should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist.
