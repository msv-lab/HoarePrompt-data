Correctness: **False**

The solution provided is almost correct but has a small flaw in the logic for updating `best_so_far`. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once at the end of the loop, which might miss the maximum product if it occurs within the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, a more concise and correct way to update `best_so_far` is to do it directly in the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated correctly within the loop.
