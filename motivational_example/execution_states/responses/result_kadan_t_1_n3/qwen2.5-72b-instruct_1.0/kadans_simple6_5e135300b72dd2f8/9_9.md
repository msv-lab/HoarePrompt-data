Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. The issue lies in the fact that the `best_so_far` variable is not updated within the loop after the initial assignment. This means that if the maximum product occurs after the first element, it might not be captured correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always tracked correctly. This ensures that the function will return the correct maximum product of any sublist.
