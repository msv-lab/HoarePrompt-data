Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, but it should be updated inside the loop to ensure that the best maximum product found so far is always tracked correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, the update to `best_so_far` should be done in every iteration of the loop to ensure it always holds the best maximum product found so far. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly in each iteration of the loop. The original code might miss updating `best_so_far` if the maximum product is found in the middle of the list and not at the end.
