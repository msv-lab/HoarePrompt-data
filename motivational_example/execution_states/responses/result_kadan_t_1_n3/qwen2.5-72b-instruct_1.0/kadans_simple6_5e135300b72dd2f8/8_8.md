Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product is found in the middle of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure that it always captures the highest maximum product found so far.

To further verify, let's test the function with some examples:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Expected output: 6 (from subarray [2, 3])
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Expected output: 0 (from subarray [0])
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Expected output: 24 (from subarray [-2, 3, -4])
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 4]))  # Expected output: 4 (from subarray [4])
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist.
