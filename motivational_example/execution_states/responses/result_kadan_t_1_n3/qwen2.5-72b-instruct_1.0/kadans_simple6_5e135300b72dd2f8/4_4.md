Correctness: **False**

The program almost correctly implements the algorithm for finding the maximum product subarray, but there is a minor issue in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the highest value of `max_ending_here` at each step. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function will correctly track the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the final result is the maximum product of any subarray in the list.
