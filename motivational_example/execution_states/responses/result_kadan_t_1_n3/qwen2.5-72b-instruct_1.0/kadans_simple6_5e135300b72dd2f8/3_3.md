Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is only updated at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product correctly if the maximum product occurs before the last iteration. To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop whenever a new maximum product is found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

However, to ensure the correctness, it is better to update `best_so_far` directly inside the loop without the conditional check:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` always captures the maximum product found so far, regardless of when it occurs in the list.
