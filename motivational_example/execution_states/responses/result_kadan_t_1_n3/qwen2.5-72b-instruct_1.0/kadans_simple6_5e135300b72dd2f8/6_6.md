Correctness: **False**

The solution provided is almost correct but has a minor flaw. The issue lies in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` at the end of the loop, which means it might miss updating `best_so_far` if the maximum product occurs on the last iteration. To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop after updating `max_ending_here`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist.
