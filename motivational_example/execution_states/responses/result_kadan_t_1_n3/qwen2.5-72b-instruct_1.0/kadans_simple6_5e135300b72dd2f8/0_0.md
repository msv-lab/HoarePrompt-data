Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a minor flaw in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the highest value of `max_ending_here` at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In the original code, `best_so_far` was only updated once after the loop, which could miss out on the maximum product found during the iteration. The corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found up to the current point in the list.
