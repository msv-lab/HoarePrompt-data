Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a minor logical error that prevents it from correctly computing the maximum product of any sublist in all cases. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` is not updated inside the loop, which means it only considers the first element and the last computed `max_ending_here`. This can lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second one:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
