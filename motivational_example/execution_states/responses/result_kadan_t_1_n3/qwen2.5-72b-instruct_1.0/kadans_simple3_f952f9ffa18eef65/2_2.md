Correctness: **False**

The solution provided is almost correct but has a minor issue that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum value correctly at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Alternatively, you can simplify the update of `best_so_far` using the `max` function directly:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Simplified update of best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated with the maximum product found so far. The original code might miss some updates if the maximum product occurs in the middle of the list and is not captured by the final comparison outside the loop.
