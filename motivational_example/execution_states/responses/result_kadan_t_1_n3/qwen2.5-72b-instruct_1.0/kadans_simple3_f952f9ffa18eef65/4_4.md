Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that prevents it from correctly calculating the maximum product of any sublist in all cases. The issue lies in the way `best_so_far` is updated. It should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. This ensures that the function correctly handles all cases, including those with negative numbers and zeros.
