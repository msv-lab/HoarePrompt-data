Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is almost correct but has a small logical error that could affect the outcome. The issue lies in how `best_so_far` is updated. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **`best_so_far`**: This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far. It should be updated inside the loop to ensure it reflects the maximum product at each step.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly captures the maximum product of any sublist.
