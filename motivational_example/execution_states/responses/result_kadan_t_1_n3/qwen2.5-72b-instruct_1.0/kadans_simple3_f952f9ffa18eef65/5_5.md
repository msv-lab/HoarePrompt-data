Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that prevents it from correctly calculating the maximum product of any sublist for all possible inputs. Specifically, the issue lies in how `best_so_far` is updated within the loop. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop after each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far. However, in the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` stores the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and the new `max_ending_here`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, leading to the correct result.
