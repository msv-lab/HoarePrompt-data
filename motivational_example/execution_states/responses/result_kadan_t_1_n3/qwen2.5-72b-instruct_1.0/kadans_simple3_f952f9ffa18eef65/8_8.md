Correctness: **False**

The given solution has a logical error in updating the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In the original code, `best_so_far` was only updated once after the loop, which could miss the maximum product if it occurred before the last element. By moving the update inside the loop, the function correctly keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
