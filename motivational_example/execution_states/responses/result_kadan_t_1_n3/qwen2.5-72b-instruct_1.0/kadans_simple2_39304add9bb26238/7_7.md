Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (i.e., `xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After each iteration, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis

- **Handling Empty List:**
  - The function correctly handles an empty list by returning negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is appropriate because there is no valid product in an empty list.

- **Initialization:**
  - Initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list is correct. This ensures that the initial state considers the first element.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
  - The use of `temp` to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` is necessary to avoid using the updated value of `max_ending_here` in the same calculation.

- **Update Best So Far:**
  - The update of `best_so_far` inside the loop ensures that the best product found so far is always tracked.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`. The approach handles both positive and negative numbers and edge cases like an empty list.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
