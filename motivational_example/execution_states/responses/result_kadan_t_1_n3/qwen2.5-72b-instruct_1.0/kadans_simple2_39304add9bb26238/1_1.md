Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Function Breakdown:

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty.
   - If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is a reasonable choice since an empty list has no sublists and thus no product.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far` to see if it is a new maximum product.
   - If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product found.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the case of an empty list by returning negative infinity.
- It initializes the necessary variables correctly.
- The iteration logic correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is tracked even when there are negative numbers in the list.
- The final result is the maximum product found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

Correctness: **True**
