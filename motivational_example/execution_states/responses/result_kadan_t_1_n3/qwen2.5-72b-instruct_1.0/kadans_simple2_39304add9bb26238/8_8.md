Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable choice because an empty list has no sublists, and thus no products to consider.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to `xs[0]`, which will store the maximum product found so far.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number itself might be the start of a new maximum product subarray, or the product of the current number with the previous maximum or minimum product could be the new maximum.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum value to handle negative numbers correctly (since a negative times a negative can become positive).

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should contain the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty.
- The initialization and updates of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are done correctly to account for both positive and negative numbers.
- The logic ensures that the maximum product is tracked correctly throughout the list.

### Conclusion

The given Python program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

Correctness: **True**
