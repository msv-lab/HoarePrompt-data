Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - This initialization ensures that we start with the first element as both the minimum and maximum product ending at the first element, and the best product found so far.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step accounts for the possibility that multiplying the current number by the previous minimum product could result in a new maximum product (especially when the current number is negative).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that we keep track of the smallest product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.
     - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty List**: The function returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element as the maximum product.
- **Negative Numbers**: The function correctly handles negative numbers by considering the product of the current number with both the maximum and minimum products ending at the previous position.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct and will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
