Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a reasonable approach because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning negative infinity ensures that any valid non-empty list will have a higher product.
   - It then initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - It calculates the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here` (`temp`).
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, the product `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous `min_ending_here`.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, the product `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating the Best Product:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current element, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should contain the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Handling Empty List:**
  - The function correctly handles an empty list by returning negative infinity.

- **Initialization:**
  - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is a good starting point.

- **Iteration and Updates:**
  - The function correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
  - The use of `temp` to store the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here` ensures that all possible products are considered.
  - The updates to `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensure that the function can handle sublists with negative numbers correctly.

- **Best Product Tracking:**
  - The function correctly tracks the best product found so far and updates it when a new maximum is found.

### Conclusion

The given Python function `func_1` is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

Correctness: **True**
