Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

### Function Breakdown:

1. **Initial Checks and Initializations:**
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is appropriate because an empty list cannot have a maximum product.
   - It initializes `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively.
   - It also initializes `best_so_far` to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - It calculates the temporary value `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - It updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, it checks if the new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

3. **Return Statement:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- The function correctly initializes the variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
- The function correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step to account for both positive and negative products.
- The function correctly updates `best_so_far` with the maximum product found so far.

### Conclusion:
The given Python function `func_1` is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list.

Correctness: **True**
