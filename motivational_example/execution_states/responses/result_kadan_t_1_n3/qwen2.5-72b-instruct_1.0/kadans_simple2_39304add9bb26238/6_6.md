Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This check ensures that if the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity. This is a valid approach because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning negative infinity indicates that no valid product exists.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and will store the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` stores the product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position. This accounts for the possibility of a negative number turning a small product into a large one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum value, which helps in handling negative numbers.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it is compared with `best_so_far` to see if the current maximum product is better than the best product found so far. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Conclusion

The function correctly handles the following cases:
- Empty list
- Lists with both positive and negative numbers
- Lists with zeros

The logic ensures that the maximum product is tracked correctly, considering the effect of negative numbers and zeros.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
