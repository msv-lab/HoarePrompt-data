Let's analyze the given Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Purpose
The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   if not xs:
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because an empty list has no sublists to consider.

   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized with the first element of the list. `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position, `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position, and `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`).

3. **Updating the Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new maximum product is greater than the current best product found so far (`best_so_far`). If it is, `best_so_far` is updated.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product found.

### Conclusion
The function correctly handles the following cases:
- Empty list
- Positive and negative numbers
- Zero values in the list
- Sublists with both positive and negative products

The logic ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is found by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step, which is necessary due to the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **True**
