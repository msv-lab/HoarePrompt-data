The provided solution is generally correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. However, there is a small issue in the logic that needs to be addressed. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product at each step.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `best_so_far` to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, and it updates the best result at each step, which is crucial for capturing the maximum product of any sublist.
