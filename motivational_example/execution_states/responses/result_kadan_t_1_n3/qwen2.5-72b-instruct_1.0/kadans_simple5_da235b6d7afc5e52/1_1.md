The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num` in the list:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness

- **Handling Positive and Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles both positive and negative numbers. By keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position, it can handle cases where a negative number might turn a previously minimum product into a maximum product.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is a reasonable default value for an undefined maximum product.
  - If the list contains only one element, the function correctly returns that element as the maximum product.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:
- Initialize: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- Iterate over `[3, -2, 4]`:
  - For `3`: `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`, `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`, `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - For `-2`: `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`, `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -2`, `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 3 * -2) = -12`
  - For `4`: `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`, `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`, `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
- Update `best_so_far` to `6` (since `max_ending_here = 6` is greater than `best_so_far = 2`).

Thus, the function correctly returns `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist `[2, 3]`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.
