The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly addresses the problem.

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current element itself might be larger than the product, or that the product of the current element with the previous minimum product might yield a new maximum.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the same values. This helps in handling negative numbers and ensuring that the minimum product is tracked correctly.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Verification

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty List**: The function returns `float('-inf')` if the list is empty, which is correct because there are no sublists to consider.
  - **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element as the maximum product.
  - **Negative Numbers**: The function handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products, which is crucial for correctly identifying the maximum product when negative numbers are involved.

- **Correctness**:
  - The logic of updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that the function can handle both positive and negative numbers and their combinations effectively.
  - The use of `temp` to store the product before updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` prevents overwriting issues.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. It handles edge cases and various types of input lists (including those with negative numbers) effectively. Therefore, the solution is valid and correct.
