The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's break down the solution to understand how it works and whether it effectively solves the problem.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This handles the edge case where no elements are present, ensuring that an empty list does not produce an incorrect result.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This variable keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element `num`:
     - A temporary variable `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product ending at the current position.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product ending at the current position, which is important for handling negative numbers.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis

- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
  - It considers the possibility of the maximum product being formed by a single element or a combination of multiple elements.
  - The use of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the function can handle sublists with negative products, which is crucial for finding the maximum product in lists containing negative numbers.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles an empty list by returning negative infinity.
  - It also handles lists with all negative numbers by considering the product of sublists that might include the smallest negative number.

### Conclusion

The provided solution `func_1` effectively solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. It is correct, efficient, and handles various edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the solution is valid and suitable for the given problem.
