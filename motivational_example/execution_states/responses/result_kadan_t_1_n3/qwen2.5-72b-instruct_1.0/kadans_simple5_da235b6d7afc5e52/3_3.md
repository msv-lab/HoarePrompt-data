The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed address the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Let's break down how it works and why it is a correct solution:

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is important because a negative number multiplied by another negative number can become positive.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp`, which is the product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we consider the possibility of a negative product becoming positive.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we keep track of the smallest possible product, which is useful for future multiplications.

3. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Why It Works

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles empty lists by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate since the maximum product of an empty list is undefined.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the list, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to see how the function works:

```python
xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]

# Initial values
min_ending_here = 2
max_ending_here = 2
best_so_far = 2

# First iteration: num = 3
temp = 2 * 3 = 6
max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6
min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3
best_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6

# Second iteration: num = -2
temp = 6 * -2 = -12
max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 6 * -2) = -2
min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 6 * -2) = -12
best_so_far remains 6

# Third iteration: num = 4
temp = -2 * 4 = -8
max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4
min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48
best_so_far remains 6

# Final result
return 6
```

In this example, the maximum product of any sublist is 6, which is the product of the sublist `[2, 3]`.

### Conclusion

Yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. The algorithm efficiently handles various edge cases and ensures the correct result.
