The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's break down the function and see if it effectively addresses the problem.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates:
     - `temp`: The product of the current element and the maximum product ending at the previous position.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element and the minimum product ending at the previous position.
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, which is crucial for handling sublists with negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Analysis

- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers by maintaining both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position.
  - It correctly initializes the variables to handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element.
  - The logic ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is found by considering all possible sublists.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the input list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is appropriate as there are no sublists to consider.
  - If the list contains only one element, the function correctly returns that element.

### Conclusion

Yes, the provided solution does solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. The function is well-structured and handles various edge cases effectively. It uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products at each step, ensuring that it can handle both positive and negative numbers correctly.
