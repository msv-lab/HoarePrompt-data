The provided solution is mostly correct but has a small flaw in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The issue is that `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found at each step. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and will store the maximum product found so far.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with the previous `max_ending_here`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element with the previous `min_ending_here` (to handle negative numbers).
     - Update `min_ending_here` similarly to keep track of the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is updated correctly at each step, capturing the maximum product found so far.
