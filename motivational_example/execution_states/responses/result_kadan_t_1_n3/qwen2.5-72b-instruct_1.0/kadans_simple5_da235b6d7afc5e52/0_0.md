The provided solution is almost correct but has a small oversight that could lead to incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Tracks the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - Calculate `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected version ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated correctly within the loop, thus solving the problem accurately.
