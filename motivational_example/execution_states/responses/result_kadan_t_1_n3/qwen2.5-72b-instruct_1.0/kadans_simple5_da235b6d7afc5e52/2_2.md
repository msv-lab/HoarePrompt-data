The provided Python function `func_1` does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within an integer list. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current position. This is important because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one if another negative number is encountered.
   - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` to indicate that no valid product exists.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), the function updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` stores the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`.

4. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example list `xs = [2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initialize: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- First iteration (num = 3):
  - `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - `max_ending_here = max(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 6`
  - `min_ending_here = min(3, 6, 2 * 3) = 3`
  - `best_so_far = 6`
- Second iteration (num = -2):
  - `temp = 6 * -2 = -12`
  - `max_ending_here = max(-2, -12, 6 * -2) = -2`
  - `min_ending_here = min(-2, -12, 6 * -2) = -12`
  - `best_so_far = 6`
- Third iteration (num = 4):
  - `temp = -2 * 4 = -8`
  - `max_ending_here = max(4, -8, -12 * 4) = 4`
  - `min_ending_here = min(4, -8, -12 * 4) = -48`
  - `best_so_far = 6`

The final result is `6`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in `[2, 3, -2, 4]`.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The logic handles both positive and negative numbers, and it efficiently updates the maximum and minimum products as it iterates through the list.
