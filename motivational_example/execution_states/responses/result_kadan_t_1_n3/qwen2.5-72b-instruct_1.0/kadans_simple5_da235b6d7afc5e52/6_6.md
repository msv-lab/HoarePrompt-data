The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's break down the logic and correctness of this function:

### Function Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with `max_ending_here`.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`. This step accounts for the possibility that the current element might be negative, which could turn a previously minimum product into a maximum product.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with `min_ending_here`. This step ensures that the minimum product is correctly tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should contain the maximum product of any sublist.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers.
- It correctly initializes and updates the necessary variables to track the maximum product.
- The logic ensures that the function can handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only one element.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: The function returns `-inf` for an empty list, which is a reasonable choice since there are no sublists to consider.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns the single element as the maximum product.
- **All Negative Numbers**: The function correctly finds the maximum product of any two negative numbers, which will be positive.
- **Zero in the List**: The function correctly handles zeros by resetting the product calculations when encountering zero.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the provided solution `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. The logic is sound and handles various edge cases appropriately.
