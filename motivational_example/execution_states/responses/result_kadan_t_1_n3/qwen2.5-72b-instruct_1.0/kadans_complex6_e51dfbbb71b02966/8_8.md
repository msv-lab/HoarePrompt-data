Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct. The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within the given list `xs`. It handles both positive and negative numbers correctly by maintaining two variables, `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`, which track the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position. This approach is necessary because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Here's a brief explanation of the key parts of the code:
- **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for the possibility of the current element being part of a new maximum or minimum product.
- **Final Update**: After the loop, the final check ensures that the best maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

The state comments accurately describe the state of the program at various points, ensuring that the logic is clear and correct. Therefore, the solution is correct.
