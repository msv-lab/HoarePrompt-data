Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list `xs`. This is appropriate because the initial maximum and minimum products are simply the first element itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is a valid approach because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered undefined or the smallest possible value.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the temporary product `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element.

4. **Updating the Best So Far**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary. However, this check is redundant because `best_so_far` is already updated inside the loop. The final value of `best_so_far` will be the maximum product found during the iteration.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

The state comments provided are mostly accurate and describe the state of the variables at different points in the function. The only minor issue is the redundancy in the final update of `best_so_far`, but this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
