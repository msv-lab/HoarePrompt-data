Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it updates `best_so_far`. The issue lies in the placement of the update statement for `best_so_far` outside the loop. This means that `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop has completed, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs before the last element in the list.

To fix this, the update statement for `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, so that it captures the maximum product as the loop iterates through the list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, ensuring that the maximum product found so far is always stored correctly.
