Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the final check for updating `best_so_far`. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is continuously updated throughout the iteration over the list. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Check**: The initial check for an empty list is correct, returning `-inf` if the list is empty.
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each element in the list starting from the second element:
  - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number.
  - `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
- **Return**: Finally, `best_so_far` is returned, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly keeps track of the maximum product found so far.
