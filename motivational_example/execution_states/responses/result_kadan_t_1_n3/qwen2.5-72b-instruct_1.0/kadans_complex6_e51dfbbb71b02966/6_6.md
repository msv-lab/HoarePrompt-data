Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, not outside. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it will only consider the final value of `max_ending_here` and not the maximum value encountered during the entire loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the loop.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at any point during the iteration is stored correctly. This ensures that the function returns the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
