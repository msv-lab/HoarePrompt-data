Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the final update of `best_so_far` outside the loop. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, not just at the end of the list.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - Calculate the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current number with the previous maximum product.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product (to handle negative numbers).
  - Update `min_ending_here` similarly to handle cases where the product becomes very small (or negative).
  - Update `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist throughout the entire list, ensuring the final result is accurate.
