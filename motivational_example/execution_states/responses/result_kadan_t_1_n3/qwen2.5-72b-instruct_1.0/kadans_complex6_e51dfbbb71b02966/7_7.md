Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the final part where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step of the iteration, not just at the end. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, ensuring that it captures the maximum product of any sublist as the loop progresses through the list. This change ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist.
