The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue in the logic that updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update should be inside the loop, so that after each iteration, the `best_so_far` is updated to the highest value found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the current element being processed, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` from the previous iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop**: The loop iterates through the elements of `xs` starting from the second element. For each element:
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

3. **Return**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated after each iteration, capturing the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
