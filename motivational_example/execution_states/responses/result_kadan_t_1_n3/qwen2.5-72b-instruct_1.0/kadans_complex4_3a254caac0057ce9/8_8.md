The provided solution is almost correct but has a minor issue in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, 
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`,
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Update `best_so_far` Inside the Loop**: The update for `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product at each step. This way, `best_so_far` will always hold the maximum product of any sublist encountered during the iteration.

### Corrected States:
- **Initial State**: `xs` is a list of integers.
- **After Initialization**: `xs` is a list of integers, and `xs` is not empty. `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of `xs`.
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `num` is the current element being processed.
  - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Final State**: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, and `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
