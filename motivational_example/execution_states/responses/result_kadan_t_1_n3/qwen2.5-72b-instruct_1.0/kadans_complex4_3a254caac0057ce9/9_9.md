The solution provided is almost correct, but there is a minor issue in the final part of the function. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the best product found so far during each iteration. Here's the corrected version of the function with annotations:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to the maximum value found so far.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, 
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, 
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, 
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, 
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iterations.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Loop Update**: The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` and the subsequent update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum product found so far during each iteration, not just after the loop ends.

### Correctness:
- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns `-inf`.
- **Non-Empty List**: For non-empty lists, the function correctly tracks the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at each element. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.
- **Best So Far**: The variable `best_so_far` is updated correctly within the loop to capture the highest product found.

This corrected function should now work correctly for all test cases.
