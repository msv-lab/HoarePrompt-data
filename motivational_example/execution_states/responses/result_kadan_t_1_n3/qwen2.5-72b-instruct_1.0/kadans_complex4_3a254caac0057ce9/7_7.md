The provided Python function aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze the correctness of the function step by step.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization:**
   ```python
   def func_1(xs):
       if (not xs) :
           return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
       min_ending_here = xs[0]
       max_ending_here = xs[0]
       best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function correctly returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is correct because the maximum and minimum products of a single-element sublist are the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list, which is the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that we consider both positive and negative products, as well as the possibility of starting a new sublist with the current element.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the same values, which helps in tracking the minimum product in case it becomes useful later (e.g., when a negative number is encountered).

3. **Final Update and Return:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - After the loop, `max_ending_here` might have been updated to a value greater than `best_so_far`. Therefore, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should be the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty.
- It initializes the variables appropriately.
- The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
- The final update ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion

The solution provided is correct. It effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers. The logic and state transitions are accurately described in the comments.
