The provided solution is mostly correct but has a few issues in its implementation and comments that need addressing. Let's go through the code step by step to ensure it works as intended.

### Corrected and Explained Solution

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def max_product_sublist(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty.
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the temporary maximum product.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of the current number, 
        # the product of the current number and the previous max_ending_here,
        # and the product of the current number and the previous min_ending_here.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of the current number, 
        # the product of the current number and the previous max_ending_here,
        # and the product of the current number and the previous min_ending_here.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of itself and max_ending_here.
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs,
    # and best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes and Corrections

1. **Function Name**: Changed `func_1` to `max_product_sublist` to better reflect the function's purpose.
2. **Return Value for Empty List**: The function correctly returns `-inf` for an empty list.
3. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
4. **Loop**: The loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
5. **Temporary Variable**: The temporary variable `temp` is used to store the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
6. **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**:
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
7. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` within the loop.
8. **Final Return**: The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found.

### Correctness of the Solution

- **Handling Negative Numbers**: The algorithm correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current point. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element.
- **Optimality**: The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, which is optimal for this problem.

Thus, the corrected and explained solution is correct and efficient for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.
