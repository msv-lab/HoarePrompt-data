The provided solution is mostly correct but has a small logical flaw in the final update of `best_so_far`. The issue is that the update of `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product found during each iteration, not just the last one. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if xs is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iterations.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all set to the first element of `xs`.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates over the elements of `xs` starting from the second element.
3. **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These variables are updated based on the current element and the previous maximum and minimum products.
4. **Update `best_so_far`**: This update is moved inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found so far is always captured.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
