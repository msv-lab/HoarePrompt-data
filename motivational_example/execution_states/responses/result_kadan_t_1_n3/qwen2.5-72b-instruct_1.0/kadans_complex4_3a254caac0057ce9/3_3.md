The provided solution is mostly correct but has a small issue in the logic where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far, not just at the end of the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty.
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop to capture the maximum product so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Loop Update**: The check and update for `best_so_far` are moved inside the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, capturing the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
2. **Final State Comment**: The final state comment is updated to reflect that `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This corrected version will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list `xs`.
