The provided solution has a logical error in the way it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always tracked correctly. Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary changes and comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop to track the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
3. **Temporary Variable**: `temp` stores the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number.
4. **Update Maximum and Minimum**: `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated to account for the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.
5. **Track Best So Far**: `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

### Correctness:
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles empty lists by returning `-inf`.
- **Sublist Products**: It correctly tracks both the maximum and minimum products to handle negative numbers effectively.
- **Best Product**: The `best_so_far` variable ensures that the maximum product of any sublist is returned.

This corrected version should work as expected for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
