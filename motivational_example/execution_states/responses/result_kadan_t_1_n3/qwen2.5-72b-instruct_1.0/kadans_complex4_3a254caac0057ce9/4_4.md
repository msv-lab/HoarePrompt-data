The solution provided is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the final comparison and update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step, not just at the end. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf when the list is empty
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here considering the current number
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum value found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
2. **Loop**: Inside the loop, `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number `num`.
3. **Update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These values are updated based on the current number, the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.
4. **Update `best_so_far`**: This is done inside the loop to ensure that the best result is tracked throughout the iteration.

This ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
