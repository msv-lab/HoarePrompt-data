Let's analyze the provided Python function step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Analysis

#### Function Definition
```python
def func_1(xs):
```
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` as input.

#### Initial Checks
```python
if (not xs):
    return float('-inf')
```
- If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning negative infinity is a reasonable choice to indicate that no valid product exists.

#### Initialization
```python
min_ending_here = xs[0]
max_ending_here = xs[0]
best_so_far = xs[0]
```
- The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
  - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
  - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

#### Iteration
```python
for num in xs[1:]:
    temp = max_ending_here * num
    
    max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
```
- The loop iterates over each element in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`).
- For each element `num`:
  - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

#### Final Check
```python
if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
```
- After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

#### Return Value
```python
return best_so_far
```
- The function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initialization and Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
   - The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is a good starting point.

2. **Iteration and Updates**:
   - The loop correctly iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
   - The updates to `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` consider all possible products involving the current element `num`, including the product with the previous maximum and minimum products. This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, which is crucial for finding the maximum product in a list that may contain negative numbers.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check ensures that the overall maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` is correct. It correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.

**Correctness: True**
