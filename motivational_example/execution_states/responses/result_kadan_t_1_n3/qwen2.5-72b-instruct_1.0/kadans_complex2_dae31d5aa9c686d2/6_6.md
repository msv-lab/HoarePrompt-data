Let's analyze the given Python function step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Overview:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers `xs`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns `-inf` because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and `-inf` serves as a sentinel value indicating no valid product.
   - If the list is not empty, it initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - For each subsequent element `num` in the list, the function calculates the potential new maximum product (`temp`) by multiplying the current element with `max_ending_here`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current element itself could be the maximum product, or the product of the current element with the previous maximum or minimum product.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the minimum product is also tracked, which is important for handling negative numbers.

3. **Updating the Best So Far:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Analysis:
- **Handling Empty List:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`.

- **Initialization:**
  - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list, which is a correct starting point.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to account for both positive and negative products.
  - The use of `temp` ensures that the product of the current element with the previous maximum product is considered.
  - The update of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that the algorithm can handle sublists with negative numbers, where the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by another negative number.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check to update `best_so_far` with the maximum value found during the iteration is redundant because `best_so_far` is already being updated inside the loop. However, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

### Conclusion:
The given function is correct in finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The final check to update `best_so_far` is unnecessary but does not impact the correctness of the function.

**Correctness: True**
