Let's analyze the given Python function step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Function Breakdown:

1. **Initial Check:**
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty.
   - If `xs` is empty, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` indicates that no valid product exists.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` if necessary.

5. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initialization:**
  - Initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list is correct because it sets the initial state based on the first element.

- **Correctness of Loop:**
  - The loop correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering three possibilities:
    - The current element `num` itself.
    - The product of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
    - The product of the current element and the previous `min_ending_here`.
  - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, which is crucial for handling sublists with negative numbers.

- **Correctness of Final Update:**
  - The final update of `best_so_far` is redundant because the maximum value of `max_ending_here` is already being tracked within the loop. However, it does not affect the correctness of the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. The redundancy in the final update does not impact the correctness but can be simplified.

**Correctness: True**
