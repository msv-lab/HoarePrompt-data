Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs) :
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty.
   - If it is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`-inf`), which is appropriate because the maximum product of an empty list can be considered as the smallest possible value.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - These variables will keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at each position, and the overall best product found so far.

3. **Iteration through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
   - This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered, as the minimum product can become the maximum product when multiplied by a negative number.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this checks if the final `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
   - If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - The function returns the best product found.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where the list is empty.
- It initializes the necessary variables properly.
- The loop iterates through the list and updates the `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` correctly to account for both positive and negative products.
- The final update to `best_so_far` ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

**Correctness: True**
