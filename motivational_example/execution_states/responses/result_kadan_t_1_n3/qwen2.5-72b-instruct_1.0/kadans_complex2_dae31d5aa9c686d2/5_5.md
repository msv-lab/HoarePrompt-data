Let's analyze the provided Python function `func_1` step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This checks if the input list `xs` is empty.
   - If `xs` is empty, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider, and thus no valid products.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list. This variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current element (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - The current element `num` (considering the element as a new sublist).
       - The product `temp` (continuing the current maximum product).
       - The product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current element (`num`) (to handle negative numbers that can turn a small product into a large one).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly to keep track of the minimum product, which is useful for handling negative numbers.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the maximum of `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far`.

5. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product found.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The function correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity.
- The initialization and iteration logic correctly update the maximum and minimum products, considering both positive and negative numbers.
- The final update ensures that the maximum product found during the iteration is returned.

However, there is a minor issue in the code:

- The line `if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):` should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration. As it stands, `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop, which might miss some maximum products found during the iterations.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:

- The original function is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the `if` statement for updating `best_so_far`.
- After correcting this, the function should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

Correctness: **False** (due to the minor issue mentioned).
