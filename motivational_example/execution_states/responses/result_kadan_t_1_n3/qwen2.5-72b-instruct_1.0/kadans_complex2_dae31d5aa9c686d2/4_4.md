Let's analyze the provided Python function step by step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Checks and Setup:**
   ```python
   def func_1(xs):
       if (not xs):
           return float('-inf')
   ```
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This is correct because the maximum product of an empty list is undefined, and returning `-inf` indicates that no valid product exists.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is correct because the initial values should reflect the first element.

3. **Iteration and Update:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` always holds the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `min_ending_here` always holds the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current element, which is crucial for handling negative numbers.

4. **Final Update:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. However, this update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far.

### Corrected Function

To ensure that `best_so_far` is correctly updated during the iteration, the final update should be moved inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original function is almost correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the final update. By moving the update inside the loop, the function will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: False**

However, with the suggested correction, the function would be correct.
