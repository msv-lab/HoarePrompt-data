Let's analyze the provided Python function step-by-step to determine its correctness for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Empty List:**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because the product of an empty sublist is undefined, and returning `-inf` ensures that it will not be considered as a valid result.

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list. `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position, respectively. `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Iteration Through the List:**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for the possibility that the current number itself might be larger than the product, and also handles negative numbers correctly.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is important because a negative number can turn a large positive product into a large negative product, and vice versa.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After the loop, this line updates `best_so_far` to the maximum value between `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. However, this update should be done inside the loop to ensure that the best product is tracked throughout the entire iteration.

### Corrected Function

To ensure the function works correctly, the update to `best_so_far` should be moved inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion

The original function is almost correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the update to `best_so_far`. By moving the update inside the loop, the function will correctly track the maximum product of any sublist.

**Correctness: True** (with the minor correction mentioned above).
