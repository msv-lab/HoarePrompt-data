Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Empty List**
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   - This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. The function returns negative infinity, which is appropriate because there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization**
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These variables are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`. This is correct because the first element itself is a valid sublist.

3. **Iterate Through the List**
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list.
   - `temp` is the product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number (`num`).
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values:
     - The current number (`num`).
     - The product of the current maximum product and the current number (`temp`).
     - The product of the current minimum product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the same three values.
   - This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum and minimum products are tracked correctly.

4. **Update Best So Far**
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - This update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated at each step.
   - However, the current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Code
To fix the issue, the update to `best_so_far` should be moved inside the loop:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect because the update to `best_so_far` is outside the loop, leading to potential missed updates. The corrected version moves this update inside the loop, ensuring that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far.

**Correctness: False**
