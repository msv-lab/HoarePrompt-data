Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is continuously updated as the loop progresses through the list. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop, which means it might miss updating the best product if the maximum product is found during the iteration but not at the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `if max_ending_here > best_so_far:` statement is moved inside the loop, ensuring that `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum product is found. This ensures the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist.
