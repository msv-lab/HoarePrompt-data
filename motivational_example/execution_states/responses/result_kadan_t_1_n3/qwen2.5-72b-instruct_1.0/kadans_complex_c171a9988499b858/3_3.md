Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the final part where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated after each iteration, reflecting the best possible maximum product found so far. As it stands, the program only checks the last value of `max_ending_here` against `best_so_far` after the loop has completed, which may not capture the true maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop, ensuring that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist seen so far. This ensures that the function correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
