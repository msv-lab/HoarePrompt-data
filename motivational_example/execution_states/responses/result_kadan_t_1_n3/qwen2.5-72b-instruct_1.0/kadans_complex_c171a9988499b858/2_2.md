Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the state comments and logic flow that needs addressing:

1. **State Comment Issue:** The final state comment for `best_so_far` is not updated correctly within the loop. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product found so far after each iteration.

2. **Logic Flow Issue:** The `best_so_far` update should be done inside the loop, not after it. This ensures that the best result is continuously tracked as the function iterates through the list.

Here is the corrected version of the program with the appropriate state comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element; `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

By moving the `best_so_far` update inside the loop, the program correctly tracks the maximum product of any subarray as it iterates through the list.
