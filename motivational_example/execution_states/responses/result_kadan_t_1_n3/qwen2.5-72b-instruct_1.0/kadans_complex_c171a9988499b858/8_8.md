Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided is almost correct but has a critical mistake in the loop where it updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop to ensure that the best possible product found so far is always updated correctly as the loop progresses through the list. However, in the given program, the update to `best_so_far` is placed outside the loop, which means it only checks the final value of `max_ending_here` after the loop has completed, potentially missing out on larger products that were found during the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `best_so_far` is updated within the loop to reflect the highest product found at each step. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum product of any sublist.
