Correctness: **False**

The given program has an issue with the final update of `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated for each element in the list, not just at the end. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = max_ending_here = best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    # State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The initial state of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` is set to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list:
  - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
  - `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- **Final State**: After the loop, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any subarray in the list.

By updating `best_so_far` inside the loop, the function correctly keeps track of the maximum product of any subarray encountered during the iteration.
