Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the final part where it checks and updates the `best_so_far` variable. The update to `best_so_far` should be inside the loop, so that it can keep track of the maximum product found so far throughout the entire list, not just at the end of the iteration. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
