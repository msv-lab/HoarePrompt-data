Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical issue in the placement of the update for `best_so_far`. The update should be inside the loop to ensure that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found so far after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Original Issue**: In the original code, `best_so_far` was only updated once after the loop, which means it might miss the maximum product if it occurred earlier in the loop.
- **Correction**: By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far, which is the correct approach for this problem.

This correction ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
