Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the loop where it updates `best_so_far`. The update should occur inside the loop to ensure that the best product found so far is always updated with the maximum product ending at each element. In the current implementation, the update to `best_so_far` only occurs once after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far inside the loop
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function will correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
