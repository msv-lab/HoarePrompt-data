The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Here's a breakdown of the logic and the potential issue:

### Logic:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This keeps track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and tracks the maximum product found so far.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each subsequent element `num` in the list, the code calculates a temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
  - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step ensures that it accounts for both positive and negative products.
  - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

- **Final Update**:
  - After processing each element, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Potential Issue:
- The logic is almost correct, but the update of `best_so_far` should happen inside the loop, not after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum product found up to each point in the list.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
The original solution is mostly correct, but the final update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop to ensure that it captures the maximum product encountered during the iteration. The corrected version provided above addresses this issue.
