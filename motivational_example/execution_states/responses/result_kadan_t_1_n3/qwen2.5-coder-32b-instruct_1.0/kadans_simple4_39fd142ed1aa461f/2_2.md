The provided solution is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated. The key idea in solving this problem using dynamic programming is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporary variable to store the current max_ending_here before updating it
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the product of current number with previous max, and with previous min
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here considering the current number, the product of current number with previous max, and with previous min
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum value found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points:
1. **Temporary Variable (`temp_max`)**: Before updating `max_ending_here`, store its value in a temporary variable (`temp_max`). This is crucial because `min_ending_here` needs the old value of `max_ending_here` for its update, not the new one.
2. **Updating `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it's greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

This ensures that both the maximum and minimum products are correctly updated in each iteration, and the function correctly returns the maximum product of any sublist.
