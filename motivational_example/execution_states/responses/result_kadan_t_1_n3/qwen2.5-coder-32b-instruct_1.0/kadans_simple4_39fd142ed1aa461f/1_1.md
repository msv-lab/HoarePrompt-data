The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there are some issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: The initialization is correct, but it's important to ensure that the initial values reflect the first element of the list.

2. **Updating `best_so_far`**: The `best_so_far` variable should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just at the end. This ensures that we capture the maximum product found up to that point.

3. **Handling negative numbers**: The solution correctly handles negative numbers by keeping track of both the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position. However, the logic in the loop needs to be slightly adjusted to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # If the current number is negative, swap min and max
        if num < 0:
            min_ending_here, max_ending_here = max_ending_here, min_ending_here
        
        # Calculate the new max and min ending here
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Changes:
- **Swapping `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: When the current number is negative, swapping these two variables helps in correctly updating the maximum and minimum products.
- **Updating `best_so_far` inside the loop**: This ensures that we continuously update the best product found so far as we iterate through the list.

This corrected version should now accurately compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
