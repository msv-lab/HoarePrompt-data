The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. However, there is a subtle issue with how it handles the `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` variables.

The main idea of the algorithm is to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Temporarily store the max_ending_here before it gets updated
        temp_max = max_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here considering the current number, the product of current number and previous max_ending_here, and the product of current number and previous min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here similarly
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
    
        # Update best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

The key difference is the temporary storage of `max_ending_here` (`temp_max`) before updating it. This ensures that both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated using the previous value of `max_ending_here`, which is necessary because `min_ending_here` might depend on the old value of `max_ending_here`.

This corrected solution should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
