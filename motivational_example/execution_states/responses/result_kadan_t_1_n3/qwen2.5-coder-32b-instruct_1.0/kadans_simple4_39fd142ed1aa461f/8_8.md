The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist (contiguous subarray) within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the implementation that needs to be corrected.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to `xs[0]`. This is correct.
2. **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: The logic for updating these variables is mostly correct but can be improved for clarity and correctness.
3. **Comparison with `best_so_far`**: The comparison between `max_ending_here` and `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop after updating both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Return negative infinity for empty list
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        if num < 0:
            # Swap min and max when a negative number is encountered
            min_ending_here, max_ending_here = max_ending_here, min_ending_here
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update the best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far

# Example usage:
# print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6
```

### Explanation:
- **Swapping `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: When a negative number is encountered, the roles of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are swapped because multiplying by a negative number flips the sign, potentially turning a large negative product into a large positive one.
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we update `best_so_far` to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far.

This corrected code should correctly compute the maximum product of any contiguous subarray in the list.
