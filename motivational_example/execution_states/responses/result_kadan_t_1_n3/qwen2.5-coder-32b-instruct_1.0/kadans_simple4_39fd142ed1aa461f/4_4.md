The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list. This is necessary because multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product could potentially result in a new maximum product.

However, there is a small issue with the implementation. Specifically, the update of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` should be done in parallel (or using temporary variables) to ensure that the previous values are used correctly in the calculations. The current implementation reuses `temp` for both updates, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Alternatively, you can use tuple unpacking to make the code cleaner:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        max_ending_here, min_ending_here = (
            max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num),
            min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        )
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

Both versions ensure that the maximum and minimum products are updated correctly using the previous values before they are overwritten. This should give the correct result for the problem as described.
