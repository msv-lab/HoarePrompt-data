The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization**: The initialization of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` is correct, but the variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just at the end. This ensures that the maximum product found so far is continuously tracked.

2. **Loop Logic**: The logic inside the loop is mostly correct, but the update of `best_so_far` should be done within the loop to ensure it captures the maximum product encountered during the traversal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # Handle the case where the input list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are all initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent number in the list:
  - Compute the temporary product (`temp`) of the current number and the current `max_ending_here`.
  - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here` (to account for negative numbers).
  - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.
  - Update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected solution efficiently finds the maximum product of any sublist in O(n) time complexity.
