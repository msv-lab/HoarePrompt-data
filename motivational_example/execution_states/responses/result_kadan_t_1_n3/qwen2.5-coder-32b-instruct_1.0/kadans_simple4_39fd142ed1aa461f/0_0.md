The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given integer list. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach, keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position. This is necessary because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.

Let's review the logic and correctness of the code:

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. This makes sense because the maximum or minimum product ending at the first element is just the element itself.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element. This variable will keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second one, the algorithm calculates the potential new maximum and minimum products ending at that element.
   - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number. This represents continuing the maximum product subarray to include the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current number (starting a new subarray), `temp` (continuing the previous maximum subarray), and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number (handling the case where two negatives make a positive).
   - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly, considering the minimum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After processing each element, the algorithm checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, which is appropriate since there are no sublists to consider.

### Conclusion:
The solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem using a single pass through the list with a time complexity of O(n). It handles both positive and negative numbers correctly by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step.

Here is the complete function for reference:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This function should work correctly for the given problem statement.
