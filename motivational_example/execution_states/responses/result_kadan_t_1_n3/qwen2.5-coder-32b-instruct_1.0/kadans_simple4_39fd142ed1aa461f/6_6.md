The provided solution is almost correct, but there's a small issue with the logic inside the loop. The main idea of the algorithm is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position because multiplying a negative number by the minimum product could result in a new maximum product.

However, the current implementation incorrectly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` using a temporary variable `temp`. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the potential new max and min products
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
    
        # Update the best_so_far if needed
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

Changes made:
1. Calculate `temp_max` and `temp_min` separately before updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
2. Directly update `best_so_far` inside the loop whenever a new maximum is found.

This corrected solution will now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
