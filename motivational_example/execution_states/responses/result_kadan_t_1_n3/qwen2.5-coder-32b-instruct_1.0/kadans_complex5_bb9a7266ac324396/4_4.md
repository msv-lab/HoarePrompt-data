The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there's an issue with how `best_so_far` is being tracked. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` at the end of the loop, which means it doesn't consider intermediate maximum products that could be found during the iterations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Tracking Intermediate Maximums**: The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop after calculating the new `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far, not just the maximum product ending at the last element.
2. **Use of Temporary Variables**: Introduced `temp_max` and `temp_min` for clarity in calculating the new `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

### Corrected Execution States:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop Iteration**: For each number in the list (starting from the second element), update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here`, update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.
- **Return**: Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

This solution efficiently computes the desired result with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input list.
