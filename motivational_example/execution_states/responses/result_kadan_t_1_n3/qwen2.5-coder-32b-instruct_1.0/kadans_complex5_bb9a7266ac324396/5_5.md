The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the function that prevents it from always returning the correct result. 

The issue arises because the variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which means it doesn't track the maximum product encountered throughout the entire list. Instead, it only compares the final `max_ending_here` with the initial element of the list. To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration of the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds the current `best_so_far`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if the new max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. This ensures that the function keeps track of the maximum product found during the entire iteration over the list.

With this change, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list.
