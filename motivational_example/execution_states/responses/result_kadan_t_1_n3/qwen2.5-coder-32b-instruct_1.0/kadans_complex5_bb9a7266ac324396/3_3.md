The provided solution is mostly correct but has a logical flaw. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated in each iteration of the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far. In the current implementation, `best_so_far` is only updated once after the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs at an earlier position in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Updating `best_so_far` in Each Iteration**: The key change is to update `best_so_far` within the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, rather than just the maximum product of sublists ending at the last element.

This adjustment will ensure the function returns the correct maximum product for any given list of integers.
