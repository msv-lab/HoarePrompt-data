The provided solution is almost correct, but it has a small issue. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop to ensure that it keeps track of the maximum product found so far as we iterate through the list. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop ends, which could miss the maximum product if it occurs before the last element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each element `num` in the list (starting from the second element), update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider the current number, the product of the current number with the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number with the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here`, immediately update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

This ensures that `best_so_far` always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far, which is the desired result.
