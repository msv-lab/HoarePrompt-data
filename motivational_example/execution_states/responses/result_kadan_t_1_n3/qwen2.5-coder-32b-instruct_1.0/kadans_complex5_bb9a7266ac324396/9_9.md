The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, it does not update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop, so it only checks the final `max_ending_here` against the initial value of `xs[0]`. This means it might miss the maximum product of a sublist that does not end at the last element of the list.

To fix this, the `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Initialization:** The initial values of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.
- **Loop Updates:** During each iteration, `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` are updated based on the current number and the products involving the previous values.
- **Best So Far Update:** After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far.

This corrected solution will now accurately compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
