The provided solution aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical error in the solution that prevents it from functioning correctly. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of num, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of num, temp, and the product of min_ending_here and num
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of itself and max_ending_here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)

    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Updating `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop to reflect the maximum product encountered so far, not just after the loop. This ensures that `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist by the end of the function.

2. **Initialization:** The initialization of `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with `xs[0]` is correct, as it sets up the initial conditions based on the first element of the list.

3. **Handling Empty List:** The condition `if not xs:` correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `-inf`.

With these corrections, the function should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
