The provided solution has a logical error in the implementation that affects its correctness. Let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step to identify the issue.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given list of integers. A key challenge here is that multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one, and vice versa. Therefore, it is essential to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position because the minimum product could become the maximum product if multiplied by another negative number.

### Code Analysis:
Let's walk through the code with an example and identify where the logic might fail.

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Issues:
1. **Tracking `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` should be updated in every iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. Currently, `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop ends if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

2. **Initialization of `temp`:** While `temp` is calculated correctly as `max_ending_here * num`, it doesn't seem necessary to use a temporary variable here. We can directly use `max_ending_here * num` in the `max` and `min` calculations.

### Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the function with proper updating of `best_so_far` during each iteration:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        new_max = max(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        new_min = min(num, max_ending_here * num, min_ending_here * num)
        
        max_ending_here = new_max
        min_ending_here = new_min
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Updating `best_so_far` Inside Loop:** Now `best_so_far` gets updated in every iteration whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds it, ensuring we always keep track of the highest product found so far.
- **Temporary Variables:** Used `new_max` and `new_min` to store intermediate results before updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. This prevents using stale values from the previous iteration.

This should solve the issue and correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
