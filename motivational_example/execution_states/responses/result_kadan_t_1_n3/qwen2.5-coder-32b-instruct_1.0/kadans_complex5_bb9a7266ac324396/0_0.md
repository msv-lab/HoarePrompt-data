The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is a logical issue with the implementation.

### Key Issue:
The variable `best_so_far` is not updated during the loop iterations, meaning it only holds the value of the first element or gets updated once at the end if `max_ending_here` exceeds its initial value. This approach does not ensure that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product found throughout the entire list.

### Corrected Implementation:
To fix this, we should update `best_so_far` inside the loop after each iteration to keep track of the highest product encountered so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of itself and max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    #       max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    #       min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    #       best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** Start by initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.
- **Iteration:** For each subsequent element in the list, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous `max_ending_here`, and the product of the current number and the previous `min_ending_here`.
- **Update Best So Far:** After updating `max_ending_here` in each iteration, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.
- **Return Result:** Finally, return `best_so_far` which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This corrected implementation ensures that `best_so_far` is always updated to the highest product encountered during the traversal of the list.
