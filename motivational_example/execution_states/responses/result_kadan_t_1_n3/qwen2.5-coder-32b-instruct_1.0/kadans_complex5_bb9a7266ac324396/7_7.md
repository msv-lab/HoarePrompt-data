The provided solution has a logical flaw. While it correctly handles the dynamic programming aspect of keeping track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current element, it does not continuously update the `best_so_far` variable throughout the loop. This means that the function may miss out on the maximum product found before the last element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of `max_ending_here` and `num`, and `min_ending_here` and `num` respectively after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, the `best_so_far` variable is updated inside the loop to ensure that the maximum product found at each step is considered. The temporary variables `temp_max` and `temp_min` are used to store the intermediate results of multiplying the current number with the previous maximum and minimum products, respectively. This ensures that both positive and negative products are considered correctly, as a negative number multiplied by a negative product can become a positive product.
