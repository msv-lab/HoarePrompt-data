The provided solution is mostly correct, but there's a small oversight that needs to be addressed to ensure it works correctly for all cases.

### Explanation:
The code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. It keeps track of two values during iteration:
- `max_ending_here`: the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.

The reason for tracking the minimum product is because multiplying a negative number by the smallest (most negative) product can result in the largest product.

However, there is a mistake in the state description and the final check. Specifically, the variable `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration whenever a new maximum product is found, rather than just at the end.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function with proper comments:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if the new max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration,
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Changes:
- **Update `best_so_far` in Each Iteration**: The line `if max_ending_here > best_so_far: best_so_far = max_ending_here` is now inside the loop, ensuring that `best_so_far` is always the maximum product found so far, not just the maximum product ending at the last element.

This ensures that the function will correctly handle all cases, including those with multiple sublists with different products.
