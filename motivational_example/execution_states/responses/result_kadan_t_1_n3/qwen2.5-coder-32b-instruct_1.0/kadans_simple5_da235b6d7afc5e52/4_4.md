The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Let's analyze whether it does so correctly.

### Key Concepts:
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa.
- **Variables**:
  - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product ending at the current index.
  - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product ending at the current index.
  - `best_so_far`: Keeps track of the overall maximum product found so far.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which makes sense because there are no sublists to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.

3. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list, the function updates `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current element.
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the algorithm for finding the maximum product of any sublist. It efficiently handles the presence of negative numbers and updates the maximum and minimum products at each step to ensure that all possible sublists are considered. Therefore, yes, the solution solves the problem as described.
