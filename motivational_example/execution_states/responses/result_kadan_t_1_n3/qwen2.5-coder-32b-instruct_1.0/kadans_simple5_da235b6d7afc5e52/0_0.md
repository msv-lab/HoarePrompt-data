The provided solution is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. However, there is a small issue with the implementation that needs to be addressed.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
  - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the highest product found so far.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each number in the list starting from the second one, the code calculates a temporary value `temp` which is the product of the current number and `max_ending_here`.
  - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step accounts for the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive one.
  - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number.

- **Update Best So Far**:
  - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

### Issue:
The issue lies in the fact that `best_so_far` is only updated after the loop finishes. However, the correct approach would be to update `best_so_far` inside the loop after every iteration, as the maximum product could occur at any point in the list.

### Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
       
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Conclusion:
With the correction, the function now correctly updates `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is accurately captured.
