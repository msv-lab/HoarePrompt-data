The provided Python function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. Let's analyze whether the solution correctly addresses the problem.

### Key Points of the Solution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list. This is appropriate because we need to start considering subarrays from the first element.

2. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element `num`, it calculates a temporary product `temp` which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This step is crucial because multiplying a negative number with the current minimum product could result in a new maximum product.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This helps in tracking the smallest product that could turn into a large positive product when multiplied by a negative number.

3. **Updating Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current element, the function checks if this new `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which should hold the maximum product of any contiguous sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:

Yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a list of integers. The logic handles both positive and negative numbers effectively by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list. This approach ensures that the algorithm works even when the list contains negative numbers, which can significantly affect the product when multiplied.

### Example:

For a list like `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function will correctly identify that the maximum product of any contiguous sublist is `6`, which comes from the sublist `[2, 3]`. For a list like `[-2, 0, -1]`, it will correctly return `0`, which is the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.
