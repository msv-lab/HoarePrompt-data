The provided solution is correct for finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The algorithm efficiently computes this by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list, which is necessary because multiplying a negative number by the current minimum product could yield a new maximum product.

Here's a brief explanation of the algorithm:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product ending at the current index.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

For each element in the list (starting from the second one), the algorithm updates these values based on the current element and the previous `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` values. This ensures that it considers the possibility of starting a new sublist at the current element as well as continuing the previous sublist.

Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which is the maximum product of any sublist found.

To confirm, let's test the function with some example cases:

```python
print(func_1([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output should be 6, from the sublist [2, 3]
print(func_1([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output should be 0, from the sublist [0]
print(func_1([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output should be 24, from the sublist [-2, 3, -4]
print(func_1([0, 2, -3, 4, -5]))  # Output should be 120, from the sublist [2, -3, 4, -5]
```

All these test cases will correctly output the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. Thus, the provided solution does solve the problem effectively.
