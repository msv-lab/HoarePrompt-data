The provided solution does correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist (also known as contiguous subarray) in a given integer list. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates the product of the current element with the previous maximum product (`temp`).
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`). This step is crucial because multiplying a negative number by the minimum product (which could be negative) might yield a larger positive product.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element, `temp`, and the product of the current element with the previous minimum product.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here`, it checks if this new value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, it updates `best_so_far`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, it returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Example:

Consider the list `[2, 3, -2, 4]`:

- Initially: `min_ending_here = 2`, `max_ending_here = 2`, `best_so_far = 2`
- After `3`: `min_ending_here = 3`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After `-2`: `min_ending_here = -12`, `max_ending_here = 6`, `best_so_far = 6`
- After `4`: `min_ending_here = -48`, `max_ending_here = 24`, `best_so_far = 24`

Thus, the function correctly identifies `24` as the maximum product of any sublist.

### Edge Cases:
- If the list is empty, the function returns `-inf`, indicating no valid sublist exists.
- If the list contains only negative numbers, the function will still correctly identify the maximum product of any sublist.

In conclusion, the solution is correct and efficiently solves the problem using dynamic programming principles.
