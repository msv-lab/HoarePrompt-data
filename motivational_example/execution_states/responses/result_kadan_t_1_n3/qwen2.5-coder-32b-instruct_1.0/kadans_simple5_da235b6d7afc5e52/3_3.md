The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's analyze whether it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - For each number in the list starting from the second element, the function calculates the temporary product (`temp`) of the current number and `max_ending_here`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This is because a negative number multiplied by `min_ending_here` (which could be negative) might become a large positive number.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.

3. **Updating Best Product Found So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist. The logic handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately, ensuring that the maximum product is correctly identified even when the sign of the product changes due to multiplication by negative numbers.

### Edge Cases:

- **Empty List**: The function returns `-inf` for an empty list, which seems appropriate if no valid sublist exists.
- **Single Element List**: The function correctly returns that single element as the maximum product since it's the only possible sublist.

### Example:

For a list like `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function will correctly identify `6` as the maximum product of the sublist `[2, 3]`.

In summary, yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers.
