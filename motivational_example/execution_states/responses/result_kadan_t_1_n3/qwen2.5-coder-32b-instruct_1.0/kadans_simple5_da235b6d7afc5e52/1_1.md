The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given integer list. Let's analyze whether it correctly solves the problem.

### Key Points of the Solution:
- The function uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list.
- It initializes `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- It iterates through the list starting from the second element.
- For each element, it calculates the temporary product (`temp`) of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
- It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number.
- Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number.
- Finally, it updates `best_so_far` if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.
- The function returns `best_so_far` as the result.

### Considerations:
- The function handles negative numbers correctly because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, which could potentially become the new maximum product.
- The function correctly initializes the variables with the first element of the list, ensuring that single-element lists are handled properly.
- The function checks for an empty list at the beginning and returns `-inf` as specified, indicating that there is no valid sublist in an empty list.

### Conclusion:
Yes, the solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in a given integer list. The logic accounts for both positive and negative numbers and handles edge cases like empty lists appropriately.
