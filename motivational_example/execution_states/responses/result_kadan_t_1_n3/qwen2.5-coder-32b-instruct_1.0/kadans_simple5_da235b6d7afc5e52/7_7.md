The provided solution does indeed solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works and why it is correct:

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Initialization:**
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element and keeps track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterate through the List:**
   - Starting from the second element (index 1), iterate through the list.
   - For each element `num`, calculate a temporary value `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step considers the possibility that multiplying by a negative number could turn a small negative product into a large positive one.
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the Best Product:**
   - After processing each element, update `best_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, return `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Why It Works

- The algorithm efficiently finds the maximum product by considering both the maximum and minimum products at each step. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied.
- By keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, the algorithm can handle lists with negative numbers effectively.

### Edge Cases Considered

- The function handles an empty list by returning `-inf`, indicating no valid sublist exists.
- The initialization with the first element ensures that single-element lists are handled correctly.

### Conclusion

Yes, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. It uses a dynamic programming approach to achieve this efficiently in linear time, O(n).
