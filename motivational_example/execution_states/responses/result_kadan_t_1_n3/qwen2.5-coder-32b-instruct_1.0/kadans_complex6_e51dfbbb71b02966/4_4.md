Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly track the `best_so_far` variable throughout the loop. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated in each iteration if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. In the current implementation, it only gets updated once after the loop, which means it might not capture the maximum product of any sublist that doesn't end at the last element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

This ensures that `best_so_far` is updated whenever a new maximum is found during the iteration through the list.
