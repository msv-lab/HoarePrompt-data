Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not update `best_so_far` within the loop, which means it only considers the maximum product ending at the first element until the end of the list is reached. To correctly solve the problem, `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to keep track of the maximum product encountered so far.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of `xs`, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration to ensure that it always contains the maximum product found in any sublist of `xs`.
