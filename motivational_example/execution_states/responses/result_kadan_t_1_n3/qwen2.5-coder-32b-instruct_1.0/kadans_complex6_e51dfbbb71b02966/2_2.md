Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. While the algorithm correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to keep track of the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at the current position, it does not update `best_so_far` during each iteration. This means that if the maximum product occurs at an earlier point in the list, it will not be captured.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and `max_ending_here` at each step. This ensures that the maximum product found so far is always stored.
