Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly update `best_so_far` within the loop. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated in each iteration to keep track of the maximum product encountered so far. Currently, it only gets updated once after the loop, which might lead to incorrect results if the maximum product is found in a sublist that does not end at the last element of the input list.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, `best_so_far` will be updated every time a larger product is found during the iteration, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is returned.
