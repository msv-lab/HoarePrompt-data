Correctness: **False**

The given solution has a logical flaw. While it correctly keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current element, it does not update `best_so_far` in each iteration. This means that `best_so_far` might not reflect the maximum product found across all sublists by the end of the loop.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum value found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration to ensure that it contains the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
