Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a critical issue: it does not update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop, which means it only considers the first element and the final `max_ending_here` for comparison. This results in missing out on potential maximum products that occur earlier in the list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, ensuring that the maximum product found so far is always stored correctly.
