Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist. The issue lies in the initialization and updating process of the `best_so_far` variable. While the algorithm correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` throughout the loop, it only compares `max_ending_here` with `best_so_far` after the loop ends. This means it only checks if the maximum product ending at the last element of the list is greater than the first element of the list. It should continuously update `best_so_far` within the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, the algorithm correctly updates `best_so_far` in each iteration, ensuring that it holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the traversal of the list.
