Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, it does not correctly update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop. The `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration of the loop to keep track of the maximum product found so far. Currently, it only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration to ensure that it always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
