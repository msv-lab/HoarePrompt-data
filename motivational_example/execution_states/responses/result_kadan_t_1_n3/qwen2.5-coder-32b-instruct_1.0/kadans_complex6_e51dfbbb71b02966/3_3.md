Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error. While it keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, it does not update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop. As a result, it only compares the final `max_ending_here` with the initial `best_so_far` (which is set to the first element of the list). This means that if the maximum product of any sublist occurs before the last element, it won't be captured.

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` inside the loop after updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This change ensures that `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum product found so far during each iteration, thus correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
