Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. The algorithm utilizes a dynamic programming approach, keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary due to the presence of negative numbers that can turn large negative products into large positive ones when multiplied by another negative number. The solution efficiently updates these values in a single pass through the list, ensuring optimal performance.
