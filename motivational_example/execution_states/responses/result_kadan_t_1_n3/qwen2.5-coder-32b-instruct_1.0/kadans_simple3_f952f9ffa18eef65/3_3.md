Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the calculation of `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Specifically, the variable `temp` holds the value of `max_ending_here * num`, but it is not consistently used in both calculations for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Instead, it should be recalculated for `min_ending_here` to ensure the correct minimum product ending at the current position.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temporary values to avoid using outdated results
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, we calculate `temp_max` and `temp_min` separately to ensure that the current `num` is multiplied with both the previous maximum and minimum products correctly. This allows us to handle negative numbers appropriately, as multiplying a negative number by the minimum product (which could be negative) might result in a larger positive product.
