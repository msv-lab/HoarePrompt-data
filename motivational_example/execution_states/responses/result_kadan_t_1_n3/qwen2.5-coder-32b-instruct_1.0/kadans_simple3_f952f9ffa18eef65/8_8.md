Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error. The main issue lies in how `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated. Specifically, the use of `temp` to store the value of `max_ending_here * num` is correct, but the update rules for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` need to be more carefully considered. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate the potential new values for max and min
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of the current number,
        # the product of the previous max with the current number,
        # and the product of the previous min with the current number.
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        # Similarly, update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update the best product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that both `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` consider the multiplication of the current number with both the previous `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, which is crucial when dealing with negative numbers. The logic for updating `best_so_far` remains the same.
