Reply Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as subarray) within a given list of integers. This approach uses dynamic programming principles, keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary due to the potential for negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.

Here's a quick breakdown of the key logic:

- **Initialization**: The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element in the list, the temporary variable `temp` stores the product of the current element and the previously computed maximum product (`max_ending_here * num`). 
- **Updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`**: These variables are updated to reflect the maximum and minimum possible products ending at the current element, considering the current number itself, the product of the current number with the previous maximum, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum (to account for negative numbers).
- **Updating `best_so_far`**: After processing each element, `best_so_far` is updated if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than it.

This solution efficiently computes the desired result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list.
