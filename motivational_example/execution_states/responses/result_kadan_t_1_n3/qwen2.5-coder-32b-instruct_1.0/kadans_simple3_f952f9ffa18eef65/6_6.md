Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. The approach used here is dynamic programming, where `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position, and `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product (since multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive one). The `best_so_far` variable stores the highest product found during the iteration.

The logic correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step and ensures that the global maximum (`best_so_far`) is updated accordingly. This algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for this problem.
