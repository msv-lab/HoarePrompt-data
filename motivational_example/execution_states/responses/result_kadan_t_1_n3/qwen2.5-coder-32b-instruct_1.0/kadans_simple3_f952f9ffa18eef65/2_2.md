Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given integer list. The algorithm efficiently keeps track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list to account for the effect of negative numbers which can turn a large negative product into a large positive product when multiplied by another negative number. This approach ensures that the global maximum product is found by the end of the iteration.
