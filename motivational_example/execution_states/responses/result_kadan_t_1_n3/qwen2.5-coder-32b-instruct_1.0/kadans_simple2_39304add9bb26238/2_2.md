Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), which makes sense because there's no valid sublist to consider.

2. **Variables**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current index.
   - `max_ending_here`: Keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current index.
   - `best_so_far`: Stores the highest product found so far across all sublists.

3. **Iteration**:
   - For each number `num` in the list starting from the second element, the function calculates the temporary product `temp` as `max_ending_here * num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This step accounts for the possibility that multiplying the current number with the previous minimum product could result in a new maximum product (especially when dealing with negative numbers).
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that the smallest product (which could turn into a large positive product if multiplied by another negative number) is tracked.
   
4. **Updating Best So Far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for the current index, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

Overall, this approach efficiently handles the problem by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products at each step, which is crucial when dealing with negative numbers that can turn into positive products when multiplied together. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
