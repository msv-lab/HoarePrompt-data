Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

The problem at hand is to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (also known as subarray) within a given list of integers. 

The approach used in the program is dynamic programming. It keeps track of two variables:
- `max_ending_here`: the maximum product of subarrays that end at the current position.
- `min_ending_here`: the minimum product of subarrays that end at the current position.

These two variables are necessary because multiplying a negative number with the minimum product could potentially yield a larger positive product. The variable `best_so_far` stores the maximum product found so far across all subarrays considered.

Here's how the algorithm works for each element in the array starting from the second one:
- Compute `temp`, which is the product of the current number and the `max_ending_here` from the previous step.
- Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`. This handles the case where the current number could start a new subarray, continue the existing subarray (positive or negative product), or reverse the sign of the subarray product.
- Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number itself, `temp`, and the product of the current number and `min_ending_here`.
- After processing each element, check if `max_ending_here` has improved `best_so_far`.

The program correctly implements this logic and should give the right result for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
