Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given integer list. The key idea here is to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list because multiplying by a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product and vice versa.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest product ending at the current index.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest product ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the largest product found so far across all sublists.

For each number in the list starting from the second element, the algorithm calculates potential new values for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` by considering:
1. The current number itself (`num`).
2. The product of the current number with the previous maximum product (`temp = max_ending_here * num`).
3. The product of the current number with the previous minimum product (`min_ending_here * num`).

By updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` at each step, the algorithm ensures that it can handle lists with negative numbers effectively.

Finally, the program checks if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list.
