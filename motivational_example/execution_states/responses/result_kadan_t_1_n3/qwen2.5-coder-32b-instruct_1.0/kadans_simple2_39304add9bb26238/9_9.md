Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (or subarray) within a given list of integers. The key insight is that the maximum product can be obtained by keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, as a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied by another negative number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns negative infinity, indicating no valid sublist exists.

2. It initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the list, representing the smallest and largest products that can be obtained ending at the current index.
   - `best_so_far` to the first element of the list, which will hold the maximum product found so far.

3. It then iterates through the rest of the elements in the list starting from the second element.

4. For each element, it calculates a temporary variable `temp` which is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.

5. It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step considers three possible candidates for the new maximum product ending at the current index: the current number itself (in case all previous products are negative and the current number is larger), the product of the current maximum product ending at the previous index and the current number, and the product of the current minimum product ending at the previous index and the current number (which could potentially become a large positive number if the current number is negative).

6. It updates `min_ending_here` similarly to keep track of the smallest product ending at the current index, which could become a large positive product when multiplied by a future negative number.

7. After processing the current number, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

8. Finally, after processing all numbers, it returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the input list.

Thus, the implementation is correct and handles edge cases such as lists with negative numbers, zeros, and single-element lists.
