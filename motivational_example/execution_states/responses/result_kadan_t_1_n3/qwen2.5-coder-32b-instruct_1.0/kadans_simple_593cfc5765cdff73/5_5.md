To determine whether the given program correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist from an integer list, let's break down the logic.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Sublist Product Calculation**: To find the maximum product of any sublist, we need to consider both positive and negative numbers since the multiplication of two negatives can result in a positive number that might be larger than any previously found positive product.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach where it keeps track of the maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and minimum product (`min_ending_here`) up to the current position in the list. This is necessary because a minimum product (which could become maximum when multiplied by another negative number) needs to be tracked as well.
3. **Iterative Update**:
   - `temp` holds the product of the current number and the last `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`. This step ensures that we are considering all possibilities of forming a new maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current number with `min_ending_here`.
4. **Best So Far**: The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the highest product found so far across all sublists.

### Analysis:

- The initial check for an empty list returning `float('-inf')` is correct as there is no valid sublist to compute a product from.
- The logic for updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` ensures that all possible products ending at each index are considered.
- The final update of `best_so_far` ensures that the highest product found during the iteration is returned.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the provided code, it appears that the logic implemented is correct and efficiently computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
