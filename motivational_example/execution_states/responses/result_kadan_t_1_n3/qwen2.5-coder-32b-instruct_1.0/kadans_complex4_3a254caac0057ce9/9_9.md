The provided solution is almost correct but has one significant oversight: it does not update `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop. Instead, it only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which might result in missing out on the maximum product found during earlier iterations. 

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product encountered so far. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Problem:
# Given an integer list, the task is to find the maximum product of any sublist.

# Annotated Program:

# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
        # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here considering the current number and the previous max/min products
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far to be the maximum of itself and max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: xs remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, 
    # max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, 
    # best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list.
- **Loop**: For each subsequent element in the list, we calculate the temporary product (`temp`) of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
- **Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here**: We update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, the temporary product, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. Similarly, we update `min_ending_here`.
- **Update best_so_far**: After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, we update `best_so_far`.
- **Return**: Finally, we return `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.
