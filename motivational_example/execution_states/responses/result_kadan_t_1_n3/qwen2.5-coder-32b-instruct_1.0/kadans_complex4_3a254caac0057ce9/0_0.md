The provided solution has a logical flaw. While it correctly updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` during each iteration, it does not update `best_so_far` within the loop. This means that if the maximum product of a sublist occurs at any point other than the last element, it will be missed.

Here is the corrected version of the function with annotations:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)

        # Update best_so_far if the current max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`,
    # `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of `max_ending_here`
    # and `min_ending_here` with `num` respectively after the last iteration,
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at
    # the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product
    # of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`.
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value, ensuring that the function keeps track of the highest product encountered throughout the list.
