The provided solution is almost correct but has a small issue. The variable `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop, not just once at the end. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf

    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    # State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, 
    # `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, 
    # `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, 
    # `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, 
    # `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

### Key Points:
- **Initialization**: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop through the list**: For each element, update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` to consider the current number, the product of the current number with the previous maximum, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: After updating `max_ending_here`, check if it is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` accordingly.

This way, `best_so_far` will correctly hold the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`.
