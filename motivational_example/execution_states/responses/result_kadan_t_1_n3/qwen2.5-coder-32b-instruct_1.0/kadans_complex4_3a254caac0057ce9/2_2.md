The provided Python code attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation that need to be addressed for it to work correctly.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `best_so_far`:** The variable `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list `xs[0]`. This is fine, but it should be updated during the loop to reflect the maximum product found so far.

2. **Updating `best_so_far` inside the loop:** The update of `best_so_far` should be done inside the loop after each iteration. The current implementation only updates `best_so_far` after the loop ends, which means it will only compare the initial `best_so_far` with `max_ending_here` from the last element, rather than keeping track of the maximum product found across all iterations.

### Corrected Code:
Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    # Initialize the variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far with the maximum product found so far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list.
- **Loop:** For each subsequent element in the list, the potential new products (`num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`) are considered to update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
- **Updating `best_so_far`:** After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, `best_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`.

This approach ensures that `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered throughout the list.
