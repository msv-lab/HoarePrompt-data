The provided solution has a logical flaw that affects its correctness. The issue lies in the initialization and update of the `best_so_far` variable. Specifically, `best_so_far` should be updated within the loop to ensure it holds the maximum product found so far across all elements of the list. Currently, `best_so_far` is only compared and potentially updated once after the loop, which means it may not capture the maximum product of any sublist if the maximum product occurs before the last element.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far within the loop
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    
    return best_so_far
```

By moving the update of `best_so_far` inside the loop, we ensure that it keeps track of the maximum product encountered at each step, thus providing the correct result for the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in the list.
