The provided solution has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly finding the maximum product of any sublist. The issue arises because the variable `best_so_far` is not being updated within the loop as the algorithm progresses through the list. Instead, `best_so_far` is only compared and potentially updated once after the loop completes, which means it might not reflect the maximum product encountered during the traversal of the list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Store the current max_ending_here since it will be overwritten
        temp_max = max_ending_here

        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max * num, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

### Key Changes:
- **Updating `best_so_far` within the loop**: This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
- **Storing `temp_max`**: This is necessary because `max_ending_here` gets updated before `min_ending_here` is recalculated, so we need to store its old value temporarily.

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Start with the first element as both the initial maximum (`max_ending_here`), minimum (`min_ending_here`), and the best product found (`best_so_far`).
- **Loop through the list**: For each number, calculate the potential new maximum and minimum products that can be formed by including the current number.
- **Update `best_so_far`**: If the new maximum product (`max_ending_here`) is greater than the current `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.
- **Return `best_so_far`**: After processing all elements, `best_so_far` will contain the maximum product of any sublist.

This corrected function should now correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
