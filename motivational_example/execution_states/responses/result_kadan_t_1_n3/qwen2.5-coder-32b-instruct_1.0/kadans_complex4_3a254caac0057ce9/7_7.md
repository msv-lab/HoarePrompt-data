The provided solution attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. However, there is an issue with how the `best_so_far` variable is being tracked throughout the loop. The current implementation updates `best_so_far` only once, at the very end of the loop, which might not always yield the correct result.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list, `xs[0]`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Loop through the list starting from the second element**:
   - For each element `num` in `xs[1:]`, the program calculates the potential maximum (`temp`) by multiplying `max_ending_here` with `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This accounts for cases where multiplying by a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive one.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`, the program checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.
   - However, this check is performed only once, after the loop has finished iterating over the entire list.

### Issue:
- The issue here is that `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. By only updating `best_so_far` after the loop, the function may miss the opportunity to capture the maximum product of sublists that end before the last element of the list.

### Corrected Solution:
To fix this issue, you should update `best_so_far` during each iteration of the loop. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty

    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` is greater than its current value. This ensures that `best_so_far` always holds the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
