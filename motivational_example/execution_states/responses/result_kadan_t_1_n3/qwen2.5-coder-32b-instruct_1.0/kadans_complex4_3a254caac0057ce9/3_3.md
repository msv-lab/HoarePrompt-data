The provided solution is almost correct, but it has a small issue. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated during each iteration to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far, not just at the end of the loop. 

Here's the corrected version of the code with the necessary adjustments:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** Start with `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` all set to the first element of the list.
- **Iteration:** For each subsequent element, calculate potential new maximum and minimum products (`temp_max` and `temp_min`) that could be formed by including the current number in the sublist.
- **Update:** Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`. Similarly, update `min_ending_here`.
- **Track Best So Far:** Continuously update `best_so_far` to be the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here` to ensure it always holds the highest product found.

This ensures that `best_so_far` is correctly updated throughout the iteration process, capturing the maximum product of any sublist by the end of the loop.
