Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within a given list of integers. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. The function `func_1` starts by checking if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) since there is no sublist to consider.

2. It initializes three variables:
   - `min_ending_here`: This keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a previously computed minimum product could potentially become the new maximum.
   - `max_ending_here`: This keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
   - `best_so_far`: This stores the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

3. The function then iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element `num`:
   - It calculates the product of `num` with the current `max_ending_here` (stored in `temp`).
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `num` with `min_ending_here`. This step ensures that we consider both positive and negative products.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum value among `num`, `temp`, and the product of `num` with `min_ending_here`.

4. After updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` for each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

5. Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist in the list.

The algorithm efficiently computes the desired result in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the input list. Therefore, the solution is correct.
