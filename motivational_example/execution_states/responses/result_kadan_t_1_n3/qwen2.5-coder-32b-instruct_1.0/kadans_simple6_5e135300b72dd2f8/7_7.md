Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within the given list of integers `xs`. 

The logic involves keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list (`max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`), because multiplying by a negative number flips the sign, turning a large negative product into a large positive product (and vice versa). The variable `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product encountered so far.

At each step, it updates these values considering the current number, the product of the current number with the previous maximum product, and the product of the current number with the previous minimum product. Finally, it returns the maximum product found.

The edge case where the input list is empty is also handled by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate for this problem as there is no valid sublist to consider.
