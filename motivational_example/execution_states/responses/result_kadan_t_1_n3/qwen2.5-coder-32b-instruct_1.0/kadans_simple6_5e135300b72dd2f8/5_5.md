Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within a given integer list. It uses a dynamic programming approach where it keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list because a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current index. This is important because multiplying by a negative number flips the sign.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current index.
- `best_so_far` stores the highest product found so far across all sublists.

At each step, the algorithm updates these three variables based on the current number and the previous values of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`. The final result is stored in `best_so_far`, which is returned after the loop completes.

The edge case of an empty list is handled correctly by returning `-inf`, indicating that there's no valid sublist product in such a case. 

Therefore, the solution is correct.
