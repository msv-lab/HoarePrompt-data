Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. The algorithm used is a dynamic programming approach that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, as the minimum product can become the maximum when multiplied by a negative number. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning negative infinity. The logic and the comments in the code suggest that the implementation is correct.
