Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist within the given integer list. The approach used is a dynamic programming technique that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position in the list, which is necessary due to the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product. The code updates these values iteratively and maintains a global maximum product seen so far, which is returned as the final result.
