Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist in a given integer list. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which is necessary due to the potential presence of negative numbers that could turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied by another negative number.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code works:

- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the smallest (most negative) product ending at the current position.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the largest (most positive) product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

For each element in the list starting from the second element, the algorithm updates these variables considering the current number, the product of the current number and the previous maximum product (`temp`), and the product of the current number and the previous minimum product.

Finally, it checks if the last computed `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

The function also handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning negative infinity, which seems appropriate for this context (though depending on the exact requirements, one might choose a different convention).

Therefore, the solution appears to be correct for the problem described.
