Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any sublist (also known as contiguous subarray) within a given integer list. This approach efficiently tracks both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position in the array, which is crucial for handling negative numbers that can turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied by another negative number.

Here's a brief explanation of how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. These variables will keep track of the minimum product, maximum product, and the overall maximum product found so far, respectively.

2. Iterate through the rest of the list starting from the second element. For each element:
   - Compute `temp` as the product of the current element and the maximum product found so far (`max_ending_here`).
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current element itself, `temp`, and the product of the current element and `min_ending_here`. This step ensures that we consider both potential new maximums and also the possibility of flipping a sign.
   - Update `min_ending_here` similarly but with the minimum function, to ensure we track the smallest possible product which could become large if multiplied by a negative number.
   
3. After updating `max_ending_here` for the current element, check if it's larger than `best_so_far`. If so, update `best_so_far`.

4. Return `best_so_far` after processing all elements, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

This method is optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, making it suitable for large lists as well.
