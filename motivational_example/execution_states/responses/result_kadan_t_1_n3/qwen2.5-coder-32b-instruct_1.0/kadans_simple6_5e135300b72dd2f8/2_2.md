Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist within the given integer list. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach, maintaining both the minimum and maximum products ending at each position to account for the effect of negative numbers (which can turn a large negative product into a large positive one when multiplied by another negative number). The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the highest product found during the iteration. 

The code also handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning negative infinity, which is a common convention for indicating that no valid product could be computed. Therefore, the solution appears to be correct.
