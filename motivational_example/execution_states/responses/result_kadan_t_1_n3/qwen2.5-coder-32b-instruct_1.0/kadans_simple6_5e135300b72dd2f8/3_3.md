Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements an algorithm to find the maximum product of any contiguous sublist (subarray) within the given list `xs`. This algorithm efficiently computes the result in O(n) time complexity using dynamic programming principles. The key idea is to maintain two variables (`min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`) that store the minimum and maximum products ending at the current position, respectively, because a negative number could turn a large negative product into a large positive product when multiplied by another negative number. The `best_so_far` variable keeps track of the maximum product found so far during the iteration. 

The code also handles edge cases like empty lists by returning negative infinity, which is appropriate if there are no valid sublists to consider. Therefore, the solution appears to be correct based on the problem description.
