Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct in its approach to finding the maximum product of any sublist using dynamic programming, but there's a mistake in the final state description comment before the return statement. The comment incorrectly states that `best_so_far` is `xs[0]`, which is not accurate after the loop has run. 

Here's the corrected version of the relevant part of the comment:

```python
#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `best_so_far` holds the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
return best_so_far
```

Other than this minor inaccuracy in the comment, the logic of the program is correct. It appropriately handles both positive and negative numbers and keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the list, since a negative number can turn a small minimum product into a large maximum product.
