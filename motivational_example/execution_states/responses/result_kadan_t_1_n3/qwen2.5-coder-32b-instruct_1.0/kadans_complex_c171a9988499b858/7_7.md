Correctness: **False**

There is an issue with the state description at the end of the function. The comment states that "If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged." This part is correct but the comment also incorrectly says that "Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged" which implies nothing else affects `best_so_far`. However, the correct behavior is that `best_so_far` should be updated at every iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value.

Here's the corrected comment:

```python
    #State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`.
```

Additionally, the loop should continuously update `best_so_far` to ensure that it holds the maximum product found so far, not just the last iteration:

```python
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update best_so_far here to ensure it always holds the maximum product found
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
```

After these adjustments, the program would correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist.
