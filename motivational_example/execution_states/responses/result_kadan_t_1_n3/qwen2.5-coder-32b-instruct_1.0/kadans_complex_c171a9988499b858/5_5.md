Correctness: **False**

The given program has a small issue in the state description towards the end. Specifically, the comment stating the final state is inaccurate. The variable `best_so_far` should reflect the maximum product found across all subarrays, not just the subarrays ending at the last element of `xs`.

Here's the corrected state description:

```python
#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any subarray found so far.
if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
    best_so_far = max_ending_here
#State: `xs` is a list of integers; `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`; `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of subarrays ending at the current element of `xs`. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to the value of `max_ending_here`. Otherwise, `best_so_far` remains unchanged.
return best_so_far
```

However, even with this correction, the logic of the program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the list `xs`. Therefore, the core functionality is correct, but the state description was inaccurate. 

If we strictly adhere to the question's requirement to judge correctness based on the provided comment, the answer would be **False** due to the inaccurate comment. If we consider the logic and functionality alone, it is indeed correct.
