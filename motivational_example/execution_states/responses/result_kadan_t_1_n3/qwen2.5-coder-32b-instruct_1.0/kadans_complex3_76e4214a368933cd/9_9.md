Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not update `best_so_far` within the loop, which means it might miss out on finding the maximum product of sublists that do not end at the last element of the input list. Here's a corrected version of the code with an explanation:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration to keep track of the maximum product found so far
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp_max` and `temp_min` are the products of `max_ending_here` and `num`, and `min_ending_here` and `num` respectively after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated in each iteration of the loop if `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. This ensures that the function considers all possible sublists and finds the one with the maximum product.
