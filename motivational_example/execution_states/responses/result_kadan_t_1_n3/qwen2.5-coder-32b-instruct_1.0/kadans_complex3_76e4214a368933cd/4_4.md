Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once, after the loop finishes, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. However, `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration of the loop to ensure that it holds the maximum product of any sublist found so far, not just the one ending at the last element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)  # Update best_so_far here
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated at the end of each iteration of the loop, ensuring that it always contains the maximum product of any sublist encountered so far.
