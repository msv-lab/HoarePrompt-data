Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it updates and maintains the `best_so_far` variable. The `best_so_far` should be updated during each iteration to ensure that it captures the maximum product found so far, not just at the end. 

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here to capture the maximum product found so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated during each iteration if `max_ending_here` exceeds it, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is captured accurately.
