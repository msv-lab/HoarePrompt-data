Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum product of any sublist because it initializes `best_so_far` only once at the start of the function. It should be updated within the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here and min_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to ensure that it always holds the maximum product found so far.
