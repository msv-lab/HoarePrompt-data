Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly track the `best_so_far` variable throughout the iterations. The `best_so_far` variable should be updated at each step if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`. However, the current implementation only updates `best_so_far` once after the loop, which could lead to incorrect results if the maximum product occurs earlier in the list.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
        #State: `best_so_far` is updated if `max_ending_here` is greater than the current `best_so_far`.
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever a new maximum is found, ensuring that it contains the maximum product of any sublist by the end of the loop.
