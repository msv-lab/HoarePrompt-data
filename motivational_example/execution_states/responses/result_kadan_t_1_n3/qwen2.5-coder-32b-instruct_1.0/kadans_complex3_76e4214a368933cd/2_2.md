Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical issue: it does not update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop as it iterates through the list. This means that only the final value of `max_ending_here` is considered when determining the overall maximum product, rather than keeping track of the maximum product found throughout the entire iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    # State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist found so far.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop whenever `max_ending_here` exceeds its current value. This ensures that the function correctly tracks and returns the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
