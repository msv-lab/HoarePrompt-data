Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is not being updated inside the loop, so it does not keep track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists. Instead, it only considers the maximum product ending at the last element of the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here to ensure it keeps track of the maximum product found so far
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated inside the loop to always store the maximum product encountered so far, ensuring that the final result is the maximum product of any sublist in the input list `xs`.
