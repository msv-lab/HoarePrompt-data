Correctness: **False**

The provided solution contains a logical flaw. The variable `best_so_far` is supposed to keep track of the maximum product found so far across all sublists, not just the maximum product ending at the current position. However, the code only updates `best_so_far` once, after the loop ends, using the last computed `max_ending_here`.

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated inside the loop whenever a new maximum product is found. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far here
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    #State: `xs` remains the same, num is the last element of xs, temp is the product of max_ending_here and num after the last iteration, max_ending_here is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, min_ending_here is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of xs, best_so_far is the maximum product of any sublist in xs.
    
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, `best_so_far` will correctly reflect the maximum product of any sublist throughout the execution of the function.
