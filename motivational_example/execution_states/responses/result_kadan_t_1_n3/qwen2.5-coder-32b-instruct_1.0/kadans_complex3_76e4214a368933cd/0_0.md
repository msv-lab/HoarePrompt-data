Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error. The variable `best_so_far` is supposed to keep track of the maximum product found so far, but it is only updated once at the end of the loop. This means that if the maximum product occurs at an earlier position in the list, it will not be captured. 

To fix this, you should update `best_so_far` within the loop after updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
            
    return best_so_far
```

With this correction, `best_so_far` is updated every time a new maximum product is found during the iteration over the list, ensuring that the maximum product of any sublist is correctly returned.
