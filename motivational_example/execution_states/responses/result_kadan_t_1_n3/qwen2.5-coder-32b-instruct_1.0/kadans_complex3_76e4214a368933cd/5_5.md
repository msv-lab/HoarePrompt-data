Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly update the `best_so_far` variable within the loop. The current implementation only checks and updates `best_so_far` after the loop has completed. This means that if the maximum product of a sublist occurs before the last element, it will not be recorded.

To fix this issue, the `best_so_far` variable should be updated within the loop after updating `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
#State: xs is a list of integers.
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs) :
        return float('-inf')
        #The program returns -inf
    #State: xs is a list of integers, and xs is not empty
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    #State: `xs` remains the same, `num` is the last element of `xs`, `temp` is the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` after the last iteration, `max_ending_here` is the maximum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `min_ending_here` is the minimum product of any sublist ending at the last element of `xs`, `best_so_far` is the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

With this change, the program correctly tracks the maximum product of any sublist seen so far during each iteration of the loop.
