Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is almost correct but there is a critical oversight. The variable `best_so_far` is only updated once at the end of the loop, which means it does not track the maximum product found throughout the iterations. Instead, it only compares the maximum product ending at the last element of the list with the initial element of the list.

To fix this, `best_so_far` should be updated in each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product encountered so far. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # The program returns -inf if the list is empty
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far in each iteration
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

This change ensures that `best_so_far` keeps track of the maximum product found at each step, thus providing the correct result.
