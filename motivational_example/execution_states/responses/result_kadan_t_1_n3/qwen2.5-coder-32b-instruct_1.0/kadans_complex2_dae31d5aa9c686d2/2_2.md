Correctness: **False**

The annotated program has a logical flaw in its implementation to find the maximum product of any sublist. The variable `best_so_far` is updated only once, outside the loop, which means it only compares the initial value of `max_ending_here` (which is `xs[0]`) with the final value of `max_ending_here` after the loop. This does not ensure that the highest product encountered during the iterations is stored in `best_so_far`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if (not xs):
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp_max = max_ending_here * num
        temp_min = min_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp_max, temp_min)
        
        best_so_far = max(best_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return best_so_far
```

In this corrected version, `best_so_far` is updated within the loop after each iteration, ensuring that it holds the maximum product found so far.
