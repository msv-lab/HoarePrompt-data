To determine the correctness of the given program, let's walk through its logic step-by-step and check whether it correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist from a list of integers.

1. **Initial Checks and Initialization**:
   - The function first checks if the list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` because there is no sublist to compute the product from.
   - It initializes three variables: `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` with the first element of the list. These variables will be used to track the minimum and maximum products of sublists ending at each element and the best (maximum) product found so far, respectively.

2. **Iterating Over the List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (index 1) and goes to the end of the list.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num` and stores it in `temp`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`. This is because the minimum product (which could become positive when multiplied by a negative number) might result in a new maximum.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Updating the Best Product Found So Far**:
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for the current element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The approach uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products ending at each position, which is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- The algorithm efficiently updates these values in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the list, making it suitable for large lists.
- There are no logical errors in the update rules for `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the provided program correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.

**Correctness**: **True**
