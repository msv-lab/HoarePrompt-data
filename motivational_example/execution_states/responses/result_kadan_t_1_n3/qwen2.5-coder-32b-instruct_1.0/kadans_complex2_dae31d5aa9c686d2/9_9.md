Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Objective:
Find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - If the input list `xs` is empty, the function immediately returns `-inf`, which correctly indicates that no product can be computed from an empty list.
   - It initializes three variables: 
     - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum product of sublists ending at the current index.
     - `max_ending_here`: Tracks the maximum product of sublists ending at the current index.
     - `best_so_far`: Tracks the maximum product found so far across all sublists.

2. **Iteration through the List**:
   - Starting from the second element (`num in xs[1:]`), the loop iterates over each element in the list.
   - For each element, it calculates the product of the current element with the `max_ending_here` (stored in `temp`).
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of the current number (`num`), the product of `max_ending_here` and `num` (`temp`), and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current number (`num`), `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

3. **Updating Best So Far**:
   - After processing each element, the function checks if `max_ending_here` (the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current element) is greater than `best_so_far`.
   - If true, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Key Points:
- The code correctly handles negative numbers and zeros by considering both the maximum and minimum products up to the current index.
- It ensures that the `best_so_far` variable always holds the maximum product found so far.
- It handles edge cases like an empty list and lists containing only negative numbers or zeros.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and the handling of various scenarios, it appears that the given program is correct for finding the maximum product of any sublist within a list of integers.

Correctness: **True**
