Let's analyze the correctness of the provided Python function, `func_1`, which aims to find the maximum product of any sublist from a given list of integers.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Handling Empty Lists:**
   - The function correctly handles the case when the input list `xs` is empty by returning `float('-inf')`. This indicates that there is no valid product to be computed since the list is empty.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized to the first element of the list (`xs[0]`). This is logical because the maximum product of a sublist containing only the first element is the element itself.

3. **Iterating Through the List:**
   - For each subsequent number in the list, the function calculates three potential values:
     - `temp`: The product of the current maximum product (`max_ending_here`) and the current number.
     - `max_ending_here`: The maximum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number. This ensures that the maximum product is tracked even when negative numbers are involved, as multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.
     - `min_ending_here`: The minimum value among the current number, `temp`, and the product of the current minimum product (`min_ending_here`) and the current number. This helps in maintaining the track of the minimum product, which is crucial for handling cases where the maximum product can change from negative to positive or vice versa due to multiplication with a negative number.

4. **Updating Best So Far:**
   - After updating `max_ending_here` for each number, the function checks if this new maximum is greater than the `best_so_far` value. If it is, `best_so_far` is updated. This ensures that the highest product found so far is always stored.

5. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which represents the maximum product of any sublist within the input list.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the function's logic, it appears to correctly handle all edge cases and efficiently compute the desired result. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
