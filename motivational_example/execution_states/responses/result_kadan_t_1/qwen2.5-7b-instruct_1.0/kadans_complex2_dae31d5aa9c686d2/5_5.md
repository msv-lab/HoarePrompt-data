Correctness: True

### Explanation:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. If `xs` is empty, it returns `-inf`, which indicates that there's no valid product to consider.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: 
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), the following steps are performed:
     - `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - `num` itself,
       - `temp` (which is `max_ending_here * num`),
       - `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
       - `num` itself,
       - `temp` (which is `max_ending_here * num`),
       - `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update Best Product**:
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

### Key Points:
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This helps handle cases with negative numbers, which can turn a small positive product into a large negative one, and vice versa.
- **Correct Initialization and Update Logic**: The initialization and update logic for `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are correctly set up to ensure the algorithm works as intended.

Given the above explanation, the provided Python program is correct and will find the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
