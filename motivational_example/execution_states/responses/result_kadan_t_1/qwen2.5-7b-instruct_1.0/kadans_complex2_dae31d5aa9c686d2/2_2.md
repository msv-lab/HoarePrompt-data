Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function checks if the list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf` (negative infinity), which is the appropriate value if there are no elements to process.
   - It initializes three variables:
     - `min_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the minimum product of sublists ending at the current position. This is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a very small negative number can result in a large positive number, and we need to consider both possibilities.
     - `max_ending_here`: This variable keeps track of the maximum product of sublists ending at the current position.
     - `best_so_far`: This variable stores the best (maximum) product found so far.

2. **Iterate Through List**:
   - The loop starts from the second element of the list (`num in xs[1:]`) and calculates the following:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: This is used to consider the case where the current element continues a previous sublist.
     - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates the maximum product considering the current element as the start of a new sublist, continuing the previous sublist, or extending the previous minimum product (to possibly get a larger product).
     - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)`: This updates the minimum product similarly, but considering the possibility of getting a smaller product by multiplying with the current element.

3. **Update Best Product**:
   - After the loop, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and updates `best_so_far` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

This approach ensures that all possible sublists are considered, including those that might start or end at different points in the list, and handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
