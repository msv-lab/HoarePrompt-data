Correctness: True

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to understand its correctness:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. In this scenario, it returns `-inf`, which indicates that no valid product can be computed.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized with the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized with the first element of the list.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element (`num`), the following operations are performed:
     - `temp` is calculated as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current element `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to be the minimum of three values: the current element `num`, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and `num`.

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

This logic is correct because:
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position, considering the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign.
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position, again to handle negative numbers flipping the sign.

By the end of the loop, `best_so_far` will hold the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.

Therefore, the given program correctly computes the maximum product of any sublist in the input list.
