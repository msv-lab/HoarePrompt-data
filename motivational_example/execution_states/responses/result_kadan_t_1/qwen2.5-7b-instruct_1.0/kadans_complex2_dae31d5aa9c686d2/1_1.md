Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty, returning negative infinity (`-inf`), which is appropriate since no product can be formed from an empty list.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   These variables are initialized with the first element of `xs`. This ensures that we start our calculations with the initial value.

3. **Iterate through the list**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   Here, we update `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here` as follows:
   - `temp = max_ending_here * num` computes the potential new maximum product if the current number continues the existing sequence.
   - `max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)` chooses the best option among starting fresh, continuing with the current `max_ending_here`, or starting from `min_ending_here` (which might turn into a large positive number due to negative numbers).
   - `min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)` does similarly but for the minimum product.

4. **Final Update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After the loop, this line ensures that `best_so_far` is updated if the current `max_ending_here` is better than what was previously recorded.

### Conclusion

The logic of the program correctly handles the dynamic programming approach for finding the maximum product of any sublist. The variables `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are used effectively to keep track of the possible products, and the final result is correctly updated.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
