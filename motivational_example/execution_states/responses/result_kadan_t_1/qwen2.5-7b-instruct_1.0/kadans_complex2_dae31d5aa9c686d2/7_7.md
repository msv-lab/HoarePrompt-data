Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Given Program:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

### Analysis:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `float('-inf')`. This is appropriate because the maximum product of any sublist from an empty list is negative infinity.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The initial values for `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are set to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Loop Through the List:**
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element (`xs[1:]`), the program updates `temp` as the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
   - It then updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This ensures that `max_ending_here` can adapt to both positive and negative numbers in the list.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This is necessary to handle the scenario where the product becomes smaller due to negative numbers.

4. **Update Best So Far:**
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, it updates `best_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement:**
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the loop.

### Conclusion:

The given program is designed to correctly find the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. Each step of the logic is well-considered and handles edge cases appropriately. The use of `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the algorithm can handle both positive and negative numbers effectively.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
