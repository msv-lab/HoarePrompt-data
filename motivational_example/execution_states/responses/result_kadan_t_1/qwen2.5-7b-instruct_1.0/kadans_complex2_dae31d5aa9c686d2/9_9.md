Correctness: True

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` aims to find the maximum product of any sublist within a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The function first checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `float('-inf')`. This is a valid base case since the product of an empty list should be considered as negative infinity.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` are initialized with the first element of the list. This is a good start because the initial values will be compared against subsequent elements.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function iterates through the rest of the list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calculates three potential products:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - It then updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary product (`temp`)
       - The product of the minimum ending product and the current number (`min_ending_here * num`).
     - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of three values:
       - The current number (`num`)
       - The temporary product (`temp`)
       - The product of the maximum ending product and the current number (`max_ending_here * num`).

4. **Updating the Best Product**:
   - After processing each element, the function ensures that `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of itself and `max_ending_here`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist found during the iteration.

This approach correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that even when encountering negative numbers, the algorithm can still find the maximum product. For example, a sequence like `[2, 3, -2, 4]` would yield the maximum product `6` (from the sublist `[2, 3]`), while a sequence like `[-2, 0, -1]` would yield the maximum product `0` (from the sublist `[0]`).

Therefore, the given Python program is correct in finding the maximum product of any sublist within the given list of integers.
