The provided solution is correct and effectively finds the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty. In such a case, it returns `-inf` because there are no elements to form a sublist, and thus no product can be calculated.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` is initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `max_ending_here` is also initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is initialized to the first element of the list.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element, the code updates `max_ending_here` and `min_ending_here`.
   - `temp` is used to store the product of the current `max_ending_here` and the current number.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that `max_ending_here` captures the maximum product considering both positive and negative numbers.
   - Similarly, `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: the current number, `temp`, and the product of `min_ending_here` and the current number. This step ensures that `min_ending_here` captures the minimum product, which is useful when a future large negative number can turn a small negative product into a large positive product.

4. **Updating `best_so_far`**:
   - After iterating through the entire list, the code checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`. If so, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

Here is the annotated version of the code for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # If the list is empty, return -inf
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num  # Calculate temp
        
        # Update max_ending_here
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update best_so_far if necessary
        if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
            best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far  # Return the maximum product found
```

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the list, making it suitable for large lists.
