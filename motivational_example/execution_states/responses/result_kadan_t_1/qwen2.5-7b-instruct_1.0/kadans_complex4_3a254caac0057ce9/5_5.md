The provided solution appears to be correct based on the logic described. Let's break down the code and explain why it works:

### Problem Description:
Given a list of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   ```python
   if (not xs):
       return float('-inf')
   ```
   If the list is empty, return `-inf` because there is no product to consider.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   Initialize `min_ending_here`, `max_ending_here`, and `best_so_far` to the first element of the list.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num

       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   For each number in the list (starting from the second element):
   - Compute `temp` as the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
   - Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of:
     - The current number (`num`), 
     - `temp` (the product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number), 
     - `min_ending_here * num` (the product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number). 
     This handles cases where a negative number can turn a small positive product into a large one or vice versa.
   - Similarly, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of:
     - The current number (`num`),
     - `temp`,
     - `min_ending_here * num`.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far):
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   After processing all numbers, if the current `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, update `best_so_far`.

5. **Return Result**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   Return the best product found.

### Correctness Check:
- The solution correctly handles cases with both positive and negative numbers.
- It ensures that the maximum product is found even when the sequence includes zeros or negative numbers.
- The logic of updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` ensures that the algorithm considers the impact of negative numbers, which can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.

Based on the provided comments and the logic, the solution is correct. Here is the annotated code again for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # If the list is empty, return -inf

    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num

        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of num, temp, and min_ending_here * num
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

    # Update best_so_far if max_ending_here is greater than best_so_far
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here

    return best_so_far  # Return the best product found
```

This solution should work correctly for finding the maximum product of any sublist in the given list of integers.
