The provided solution appears to be correct based on the description and the steps outlined in the comments. The algorithm used here is known as the "kadane's algorithm" variant for finding the maximum product of any sublist in an integer list.

Let's break down the logic to ensure it works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element in the list (`num`), we calculate:
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - `num` itself (starting a new sublist),
       - `temp` (continuing the current sublist),
       - `min_ending_here * num` (reversing the sign, useful when dealing with negative numbers).
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
       - `num` itself,
       - `temp`,
       - `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, we check if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far` and update `best_so_far` if necessary.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `best_so_far` which contains the maximum product of any sublist.

Here is the annotated code with a brief explanation of why it works:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')  # If the list is empty, return negative infinity
    
    # Initialize variables
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        # Calculate temp as the product of the current max ending here and the next number
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update max_ending_here to be the maximum of:
        # 1. The next number itself (starting a new sublist),
        # 2. The temp value (continuing the current sublist),
        # 3. The product of min_ending_here and the next number (reversing the sign, useful with negative numbers)
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        # Update min_ending_here to be the minimum of:
        # 1. The next number itself,
        # 2. The temp value,
        # 3. The product of min_ending_here and the next number
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    # Check if the final max_ending_here is greater than best_so_far and update best_so_far if necessary
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This solution correctly handles cases where the list contains negative numbers, zero, or positive numbers. It finds the maximum product of any sublist in the given integer list. Therefore, the solution is correct.
