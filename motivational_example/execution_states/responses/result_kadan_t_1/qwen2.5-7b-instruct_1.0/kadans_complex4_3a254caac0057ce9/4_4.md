The solution provided appears to be mostly correct and should work for finding the maximum product of any sublist in a given list of integers. Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where the input list `xs` is empty by returning `float('-inf')`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list. These variables keep track of the minimum and maximum product of sublists that end at the current position.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element, which will store the overall maximum product found so far.

3. **Iterate Through List**:
   - For each number in the list (starting from the second element), the function calculates three possible values:
     - `num`: The current number.
     - `temp = max_ending_here * num`: The product of the current maximum product ending here and the current number.
     - `min_ending_here * num`: The product of the current minimum product ending here and the current number.
   - It updates `max_ending_here` to the maximum of these three values, ensuring that `max_ending_here` always represents the maximum product of any sublist ending at the current position.
   - Similarly, it updates `min_ending_here` to the minimum of these three values, ensuring that `min_ending_here` always represents the minimum product of any sublist ending at the current position.

4. **Update Best So Far**:
   - After processing all elements, the function checks if the `max_ending_here` value is greater than `best_so_far`. If it is, then `best_so_far` is updated to this new value.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `best_so_far`, which contains the maximum product of any sublist in the list.

Given the above steps, the provided solution should correctly compute the maximum product of any sublist in the input list. Here is the annotated code again for clarity:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
    
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]
    
    for num in xs[1:]:
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
    
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    return best_so_far
```

This solution should handle edge cases such as lists with negative numbers and zeros correctly. It efficiently finds the maximum product using dynamic programming principles.

So, yes, the solution is correct.
