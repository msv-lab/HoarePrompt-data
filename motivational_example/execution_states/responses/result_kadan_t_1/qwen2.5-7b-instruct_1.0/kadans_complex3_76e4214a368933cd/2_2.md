The given solution appears to be correct. Let's break down the logic and verify each step:

### Explanation:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `xs` and finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist.
- `min_ending_here` keeps track of the minimum product ending at the current position. This is crucial because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product.
- `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum product ending at the current position.
- `best_so_far` keeps track of the overall maximum product seen so far.

### Verification:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_ending_here = xs[0]
   max_ending_here = xs[0]
   best_so_far = xs[0]
   ```
   - These lines initialize the variables with the first element of the list.

2. **Iterating through the list**:
   ```python
   for num in xs[1:]:
       temp = max_ending_here * num
       
       max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
       
       min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
   ```
   - For each element `num` in the list (starting from the second element), the following operations are performed:
     - `temp` is the product of the current `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`. This covers the scenarios where:
       - Starting a new sublist (just `num`).
       - Extending the current `max_ending_here` (multiplying it by `num`).
       - Extending the current `min_ending_here` (multiplying it by `num`), which could potentially turn a negative product into a positive one.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated similarly but to the minimum of the three values. This ensures that we keep track of the minimum product in case a future positive product can be formed.

3. **Final update**:
   ```python
   if (max_ending_here > best_so_far) :
       best_so_far = max_ending_here
   ```
   - After processing all elements, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, then `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return statement**:
   ```python
   return best_so_far
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum product found.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly handles both positive and negative numbers and efficiently finds the maximum product of any contiguous sublist. The logic is sound and the state transitions described in the comments are accurate.
