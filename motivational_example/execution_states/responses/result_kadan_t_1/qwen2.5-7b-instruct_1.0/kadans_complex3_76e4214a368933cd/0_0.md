To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly checks if the input list `xs` is empty. If it is, it returns `-inf`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

3. **Iterate Through List**:
   - For each element in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and the current number (`num`).
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of:
       - `num`
       - `temp`
       - `min_ending_here * num`
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of:
       - `num`
       - `temp`
       - `min_ending_here * num`

4. **Final Check and Return**:
   - After the loop, if `max_ending_here` is greater than `best_so_far`, `best_so_far` is updated to `max_ending_here`.
   - The function returns `best_so_far`.

### Correctness Verification:

- The logic handles both positive and negative numbers correctly. When a negative number is encountered, it can turn a large positive product into a large negative one, and vice versa. This is crucial for finding the maximum product of any sublist.
- The variable `min_ending_here` helps track the minimum product up to the current position, ensuring that when a negative number is encountered, the minimum product can be used to produce a larger product when multiplied by a subsequent negative number.

### Conclusion:

The given Python code is indeed correct for solving the problem of finding the maximum product of any sublist in a list of integers. It properly handles edge cases such as empty lists and efficiently updates the maximum product considering both positive and negative products.

**Correctness: True**
