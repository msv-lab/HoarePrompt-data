The provided program appears to be solving the problem correctly. The algorithm uses dynamic programming principles to keep track of the maximum and minimum products of sublists ending at each position. This is necessary because a negative number can turn a previously small positive product into a large positive product when multiplied.

Let's break down the logic to confirm its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.
   - `best_so_far` is also initialized to the first element of the list `xs`.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
     - `temp` is set to the product of `max_ending_here` and `num`.
     - `max_ending_here` is updated to the maximum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.
     - `min_ending_here` is updated to the minimum of three values: `num`, `temp`, and `min_ending_here * num`.

3. **Update the best so far**:
   - After the loop, `best_so_far` is updated to the maximum of `best_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `best_so_far`, which holds the maximum product of any sublist.

Given these steps, the logic is sound and should handle all edge cases, including lists with negative numbers and zeros.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
