The provided solution is generally correct, but there are a few improvements and clarifications that can be made. The main issue is in the state description and the logic of updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`.

Here is the corrected and more detailed version of the program with explanations:

```python
def func_1(xs):
    # State: xs is a list of integers.
    if not xs:
        return float('-inf')
        # The program returns -inf
    
    # State: xs is a non-empty list of integers
    min_ending_here = xs[0]
    max_ending_here = xs[0]
    best_so_far = xs[0]

    for num in xs[1:]:
        # State: `num` is the current number from the list, 
        # `temp` is the intermediate product used in the calculation of `max_ending_here`.
        temp = max_ending_here * num
        
        # Update `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of three values:
        # 1. The current number itself (if it's positive and could potentially be the start of a new sublist),
        # 2. The product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number,
        # 3. The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number (since multiplying by a negative number could flip the sign).
        max_ending_here = max(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)

        # Update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of three values:
        # 1. The current number itself (if it's negative and could potentially be the start of a new sublist),
        # 2. The product of the previous `max_ending_here` and the current number,
        # 3. The product of the previous `min_ending_here` and the current number.
        min_ending_here = min(num, temp, min_ending_here * num)
        
    # State: `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here` are updated to reflect the products of sublists ending at the last element of `xs`.
    # `best_so_far` holds the maximum product found so far.
    if max_ending_here > best_so_far:
        best_so_far = max_ending_here
    
    # State: `xs` remains unchanged, `best_so_far` contains the maximum product of any sublist in `xs`.
    return best_so_far
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clarified State Transitions**: Added more detailed comments explaining what each variable represents and how it changes during the iteration.
2. **Logic of Updating `min_ending_here` and `max_ending_here`**: Ensured the logic is clear and correctly reflects the problem requirements.

Given these corrections, the overall solution remains correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
