Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided solution code.

### Problem Statement Recap:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `students_A`: List of first-semester students per class at Building A (12 classes).
   - `admins_A`: List of administrators per class at Building A (12 classes).
   - `students_B`: List of first-semester students per class at Building B (16 classes).
   - `admins_B`: List of administrators per class at Building B (16 classes).
   - `profs_B`: List of professors per class at Building B (16 classes).

2. **Objective**:
   - Balance the number of people between Building A and Building B by potentially removing some individuals from the more populous building.
   - Calculate an equal bonus for each moved person.
   - The bonus pool is generated by every staying person at both buildings contributing $10.

3. **Output**:
   - Bonus per moved person.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Zero Surplus**: If `surplus` is zero (i.e., the buildings are already balanced), the division by zero will cause an error. The code should handle this case separately.
2. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The bonus pool is correctly calculated as `stayers * 10`.
3. **Return Value**: The return value is `bonus_pool / surplus`, which is correct if `surplus` is not zero.

### Corrected Code:
To address the potential division by zero issue, we can add a condition to check if the surplus is zero and handle it appropriately (e.g., returning 0 as the bonus per moved person since no one needs to move).

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No one needs to move, so the bonus is 0
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Surplus Check**: Before calculating the bonus, the code checks if the `surplus` is zero. If it is, it means the buildings are already balanced, and thus no one needs to move, resulting in a bonus of 0.
- **Division Safety**: By adding this check, we ensure that there is no division by zero error.

### Conclusion:
The original solution had a potential division by zero issue. The corrected version addresses this by returning 0 when the surplus is zero. Therefore, the corrected version is correct.
