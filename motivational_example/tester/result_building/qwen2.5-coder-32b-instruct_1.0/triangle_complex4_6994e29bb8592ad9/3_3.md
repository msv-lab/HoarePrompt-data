The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Bonus Pool Calculation:** The calculation of the bonus pool is incorrect. The problem states that every staying person (not just the minimum number of people at either building) contributes $10 to the bonus pool. Thus, the bonus pool should be calculated as the total number of people minus the surplus, multiplied by 10.

2. **Handling Zero Surplus:** The code does not handle the case where `surplus` is zero, which would result in a division by zero error. If `total_A` equals `total_B`, there's no surplus, and thus no one needs to move, and the bonus should be zero.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No one needs to move, so bonus is zero
    
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved

# Example usage:
students_A = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]  # 120 students
admins_A = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]              # 24 admins
students_B = [15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]  # 240 students
admins_B = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]              # 48 admins
profs_B = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]               # 16 professors

print(func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B))
```

### Explanation of the Corrections:
- **Bonus Pool:** The bonus pool is now correctly calculated as `stayers * 10`.
- **Zero Surplus Handling:** Added a check to return `0` if `surplus` is zero, avoiding division by zero.

This should correctly compute the bonus per moved person based on the problem's requirements.
