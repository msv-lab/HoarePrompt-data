Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided Python code to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `students_A`: List of the number of first-semester students per class at Building A (length 12).
   - `admins_A`: List of the number of administrators per class at Building A (length 12).
   - `students_B`: List of the number of first-semester students per class at Building B (length 16).
   - `admins_B`: List of the number of administrators per class at Building B (length 16).
   - `profs_B`: List of the number of professors per class at Building B (length 16).

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the total number of people in each building.
   - Determine the surplus of people in the more populous building.
   - Calculate a bonus for each person moved to balance the population.
   - The bonus is derived from a bonus pool where each person (staying in either building) contributes $10.

3. **Bonus Calculation**:
   - Total number of people in Building A (`total_A`) = sum of students in A + sum of admins in A.
   - Total number of people in Building B (`total_B`) = sum of students in B + sum of admins in B + sum of professors in B.
   - Surplus of people in the more populous building (`surplus`) = |total_A - total_B|.
   - Total number of people staying (`stayers`) = total_A + total_B - surplus.
   - Bonus pool (`bonus_pool`) = stayers * $10.
   - Bonus per moved person (`bonus_per_moved`) = bonus_pool / surplus.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates `total_A`, `total_B`, `surplus`, `stayers`, `bonus_pool`, and `bonus_per_moved` correctly. However, there are a couple of points to consider:

1. **Handling Zero Surplus**:
   - If `total_A == total_B` (i.e., `surplus == 0`), then dividing `bonus_pool` by `surplus` will result in a division by zero error.
   - The code does not handle this edge case explicitly. It should return `0` as the bonus per moved person when there is no surplus.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The return value is correct under normal circumstances, but the comment provided at the end seems incorrect. The comment suggests that `bonus_pool` is always `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`, which is not necessarily true. `bonus_pool` is actually `10 * (total_A + total_B - surplus)`.

Here is a revised version of the function that handles the edge case of zero surplus:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No one needs to be moved, so bonus per moved person is 0
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is mostly correct but does not handle the edge case where there is no surplus of people. The revised code addresses this issue and ensures that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
