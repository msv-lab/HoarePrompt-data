Let's analyze the provided solution step by step to determine if it correctly addresses the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `students_A`: List of the number of first-semester students per class at Building A (12 classes).
   - `admins_A`: List of the number of administrators per class at Building A (12 classes).
   - `students_B`: List of the number of first-semester students per class at Building B (16 classes).
   - `admins_B`: List of the number of administrators per class at Building B (16 classes).
   - `profs_B`: List of the number of professors per class at Building B (16 classes).

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the total number of people in both buildings.
   - Determine the surplus of people in the more populous building.
   - Balance the number of people in both buildings by moving people from the more populous building to the less populous one.
   - Calculate a bonus for each moved person. The bonus pool is contributed to by every staying person at both buildings, with each contributing $10.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Total Calculation**:
   - `total_A` correctly calculates the total number of people in Building A.
   - `total_B` correctly calculates the total number of people in Building B.

2. **Surplus Calculation**:
   - `surplus` correctly computes the absolute difference between the populations of the two buildings.

3. **Stayers Calculation**:
   - `stayers` should be the total number of people minus the surplus, but the formula is incorrect. It should simply be the smaller of the two totals since that's how many people would remain in the less populous building after balancing.

4. **Bonus Pool Calculation**:
   - `bonus_pool` correctly calculates the total amount of money contributed to the bonus pool based on the number of stayers.

5. **Bonus Per Moved Person Calculation**:
   - `bonus_per_moved` correctly calculates the bonus per moved person, assuming the surplus is not zero.

### Issues:
- The formula for `stayers` is incorrect. Instead of `total_A + total_B - surplus`, it should be `min(total_A, total_B)`.
- If `surplus` is zero (i.e., the buildings already have equal numbers of people), the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

### Corrected Solution:
```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No need to move people, so bonus is zero
    
    stayers = min(total_A, total_B)
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This corrected solution ensures that the bonus calculation is done correctly and handles the edge case where the buildings are already balanced.
