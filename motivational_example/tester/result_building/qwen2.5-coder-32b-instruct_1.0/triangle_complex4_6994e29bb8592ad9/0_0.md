Let's analyze the solution step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Understanding the Problem
We have two buildings, A and B, with different numbers of first-semester students, administrators, and professors. We need to balance the number of people in these buildings by potentially moving some individuals from the more populous building to the less populous one. The bonus pool is created by contributions from everyone who stays (i.e., those not moved), and the bonus is distributed equally among those who are moved.

### Key Points in the Code
1. **Calculate Total People in Each Building**:
   - `total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)`
   - `total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)`

2. **Determine Surplus**:
   - `surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)`

3. **Calculate Bonus Pool**:
   - `stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus`
   - `bonus_pool = stayers * 10`

4. **Calculate Bonus Per Moved Person**:
   - `bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus`

### Issues in the Provided Code
The provided code has an issue with the bonus pool calculation and the handling of edge cases.

#### Issue with Bonus Pool Calculation
The comment suggests that `bonus_pool` is `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`, but this is incorrect. The bonus pool should be based on the number of people who stay, not just the minimum of the totals in the two buildings.

#### Handling Edge Cases
If `total_A` equals `total_B`, there is no surplus, and attempting to divide by zero will result in an error. The code does not handle this case.

### Corrected Code
Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    
    if total_A == total_B:
        return 0  # No surplus, no one needs to move, hence no bonus
    
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved

# Example usage:
students_A = [20] * 12  # 12 classes with 20 students each
admins_A = [5] * 12     # 12 classes with 5 admins each
students_B = [18] * 16  # 16 classes with 18 students each
admins_B = [4] * 16     # 16 classes with 4 admins each
profs_B = [2] * 16      # 16 classes with 2 professors each

print(func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B))
```

### Conclusion
The original code is not correct due to the incorrect bonus pool calculation and lack of handling for the case where both buildings already have an equal number of people. The corrected code addresses these issues.
