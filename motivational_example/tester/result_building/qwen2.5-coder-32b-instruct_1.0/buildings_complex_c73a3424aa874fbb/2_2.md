Correctness: **False**

There are several issues with the provided program that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Parameter**: The parameter `profs_B` is used in the calculation of `total_B` but it is not included in the function signature. The function should include this parameter.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `bonus_pool`**: According to the problem statement, the `bonus_pool` is created by every staying person at both buildings contributing $10. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the `bonus_pool` is `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`. Instead, it should be calculated as `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is the total number of people minus the surplus (i.e., `total_A + total_B - surplus`).

3. **Handling of Zero Surplus**: If `surplus` is zero, meaning the buildings already have an equal number of people, the code will attempt to divide by zero when calculating `bonus_per_moved`. This needs to be handled appropriately, perhaps by returning 0 or indicating no moves are needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    # Handle the case where there's no surplus
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0
    
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This corrected function addresses the issues mentioned and now properly calculates the bonus per moved person.
