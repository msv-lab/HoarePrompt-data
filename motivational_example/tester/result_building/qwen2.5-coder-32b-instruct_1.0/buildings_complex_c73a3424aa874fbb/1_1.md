Correctness: **False**

The given program contains several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Parameter**: The function `func_1` takes four parameters (`students_A`, `admins_A`, `students_B`, `admins_B`), but inside the function, `profs_B` is referenced without being passed as an argument. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The problem description states that every staying person (at both buildings) contributes $10 to the bonus pool. Therefore, the calculation of the bonus pool should be `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is the total number of people minus the surplus. The current implementation incorrectly suggests that `bonus_pool` should be `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`, which does not align with the problem statement.

3. **Division by Zero**: If `total_A` equals `total_B`, the `surplus` will be `0`, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `bonus_per_moved`.

4. **Logic for Equalizing People**: The function calculates the surplus and bonus per moved person but does not actually move people to balance the buildings. To meet the requirement of making the buildings have an equal number of people, additional logic is needed to distribute the surplus people across the classes.

Here's a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No bonus needed if the numbers are already equal
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    # Logic to move people (simplified for demonstration)
    # This is a placeholder for actual redistribution logic
    # ...
    
    return bonus_per_moved

# Example usage:
students_A = [30, 25, 30, 25, 30, 25, 30, 25, 30, 25, 30, 25]
admins_A = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
students_B = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]
admins_B = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
profs_B = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

print(func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B))
```

This revised function handles the missing parameter, corrects the bonus pool calculation, avoids division by zero, and includes a placeholder for the logic to move people.
