Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed to make it align with the problem description:

1. **Missing Argument**: The function `func_1` is supposed to take five arguments (students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B), but only four are specified in the function signature.

2. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The problem states that every staying person at both buildings contributes $10 to the bonus pool. However, the program incorrectly calculates `stayers` as `total_A + total_B - surplus`. Instead, it should calculate `stayers` as `total_A + total_B - surplus` which is technically correct in terms of the number of people staying, but the bonus pool should indeed be based on the number of people staying. Therefore, `stayers` should simply be `total_A + total_B - surplus`, but the bonus pool calculation should consider all people except those being moved. The correct formula for the bonus pool should be `bonus_pool = (total_A + total_B - surplus) * 10`.

3. **Handling Zero Surplus**: If `surplus` is zero, the program will attempt to divide by zero when calculating `bonus_per_moved`. This needs to be handled appropriately, possibly by returning 0 or indicating that no movement is needed.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No movement needed, hence no bonus to be given

    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

With these corrections, the program should now accurately calculate the bonus per moved person based on the provided problem description.
