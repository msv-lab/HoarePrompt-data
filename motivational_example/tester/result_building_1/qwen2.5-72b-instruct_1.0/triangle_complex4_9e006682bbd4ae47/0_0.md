The provided solution has a logical issue when it comes to handling the case where the number of people in both buildings is already equal. In such a case, the `surplus` would be zero, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `bonus_per_moved`.

Additionally, the problem statement specifies that the goal is to make the number of people in both buildings equal by removing the extra people from the more populous building. The current solution calculates the total number of people in both buildings and then computes the surplus, but it does not explicitly move people or adjust the counts to ensure the buildings have an equal number of people.

Here's a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    
    # Determine which building has more people
    if total_A > total_B:
        surplus = total_A - total_B
        target_total = total_B
    else:
        surplus = total_B - total_A
        target_total = total_A
    
    # Ensure the surplus is not zero to avoid division by zero
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No bonus needed if the buildings already have an equal number of people
    
    # Calculate the number of people who will stay
    stayers = target_total * 2  # Total people after making the numbers equal
    
    # Calculate the bonus pool
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    # Calculate the bonus per moved person
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Calculation**: The total number of people in Building A (`total_A`) and Building B (`total_B`) are calculated.
2. **Surplus Calculation**: The surplus is determined as the absolute difference between `total_A` and `total_B`. However, we also determine which building has more people to know the target total after equalizing.
3. **Division by Zero Handling**: If the buildings already have an equal number of people (`surplus == 0`), the function returns 0 because no bonus is needed.
4. **Stayers Calculation**: The number of people who will stay is twice the target total (since both buildings will have the same number of people).
5. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: Each staying person contributes $10 to the bonus pool.
6. **Bonus Per Moved Person**: The bonus per moved person is calculated by dividing the bonus pool by the surplus.

This revised function ensures that the division by zero error is handled and that the buildings are correctly balanced before calculating the bonus.
