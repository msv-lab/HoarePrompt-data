Correctness: **False**

Here's why:

The annotated comment at the end of the function contains an incorrect statement regarding the `bonus_pool`. The actual calculation for the `bonus_pool` is `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is the sum of all individuals minus the surplus (the excess number of people in the more populous building). This means `bonus_pool` is equal to `(total_A + total_B - surplus) * 10`, not `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`.

Moreover, the bonus pool should only be divided by the surplus if there is indeed a surplus; otherwise, if the buildings already have an equal number of people (`surplus == 0`), dividing by zero would cause an error. In this case, the bonus per moved person should logically be 0 because no one needs to be moved.

To fix these issues, we can add a check for when `surplus` is 0 and adjust the `bonus_pool` description accordingly:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No one needs to move, so bonus is 0
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This revised code correctly handles the edge case where the two buildings already have an equal number of people and ensures the bonus calculation is accurate.
