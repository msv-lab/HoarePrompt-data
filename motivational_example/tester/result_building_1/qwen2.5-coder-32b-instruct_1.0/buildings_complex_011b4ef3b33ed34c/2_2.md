Correctness: **False**

Here's why:

The annotated explanation contains an error regarding the calculation of the bonus pool. Specifically, the statement "the program returns `bonus_pool / surplus`. Given that 'total_A' is a positive integer equal to the number of people originally at building A, and 'total_B' is a positive integer equal to the number of people originally at building B, `bonus_pool` is a positive integer equal to `20 * min(total_A, total_B)` and `surplus` is a positive integer or 0 equal to the absolute difference between `total_A` and `total_B`, the program returns `(20 * min(total_A, total_B)) / abs(total_A - total_B)`." is incorrect.

The bonus pool should be calculated based on the number of people staying at both buildings combined after the redistribution, not `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`. The correct bonus pool is `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is the total number of people minus the surplus (i.e., the number of people who remain in both buildings after the redistribution).

Additionally, the code assumes that there will always be a surplus (people need to be moved), but it doesn't handle the case where `surplus` is zero (both buildings already have an equal number of people). If `surplus` is zero, the code will attempt to divide by zero, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`.

To fix this, the function should check if `surplus` is zero before attempting to calculate `bonus_per_moved`. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No one needs to move, so the bonus per moved person is 0
    
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

With these corrections, the function will correctly compute the bonus per moved person when the number of people in both buildings needs to be balanced.
