Correctness: **False**

Here's why the given program is incorrect:

1. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The program calculates the bonus pool as `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is the total number of people minus the surplus (difference in population). However, the problem description states that every staying person at both buildings contributes $10 to the bonus pool. So the bonus pool should be calculated as `(total_A + total_B - surplus) * 10`, which is the same as `stayers * 10` but this is not the main issue. The main issue is the calculation of `stayers`.

2. **Stayers Calculation**: The program calculates `stayers` as `total_A + total_B - surplus`. This is correct in terms of mathematics but doesn't represent the actual count of people who stay. `stayers` should actually be the sum of people who stay after moving some to balance the two buildings. This means `stayers` should be `min(total_A, total_B)` instead of `total_A + total_B - surplus`.

3. **Handling Zero Surplus**: If there is no surplus (i.e., `total_A == total_B`), the program will attempt to divide by zero, which is incorrect. In this case, no movement is needed, and the bonus per moved person should be zero.

4. **Bonus Calculation**: The bonus per moved person should be `bonus_pool / surplus` only if there is a surplus. Otherwise, it should be zero.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No need to move anyone, so bonus is zero
    
    stayers = min(total_A, total_B)
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This corrected function properly handles the bonus calculation and avoids division by zero.
