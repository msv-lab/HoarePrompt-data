Correctness: **False**

Here's the reasoning:

The provided explanation in the comments suggests an incorrect calculation for the `bonus_pool`. According to the problem description, the bonus pool should be formed by every staying person (not just the minimum of `total_A` and `total_B`) contributing $10. Therefore, the correct calculation for the `bonus_pool` should be `stayers * 10`.

However, there's another issue with the formula given in the comments for `bonus_pool`. It states `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`, but it should simply be `stayers * 10` because `stayers` already accounts for the total number of people remaining after moving the surplus from one building to the other, not just the smaller total of the two buildings.

Additionally, if `surplus` is 0 (which means both buildings already have an equal number of people), the program will attempt to divide `bonus_pool` by 0, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`. This case should be handled separately.

Here's the corrected version of the function with these issues addressed:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No movement needed, hence no bonus to be given
    
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This version handles the edge case where there is no surplus and avoids incorrect assumptions about the bonus pool calculation.
