Correctness: **False**

Here's why the program is incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The bonus pool should be calculated by summing up the contributions from every person who stays in both buildings. This means the bonus pool is `10 * (total_A + total_B - surplus)`, not `stayers * 10` as the program currently does. The term "stayers" in the program seems to be calculated correctly as `total_A + total_B - surplus`, but using this value again for the bonus pool is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Equal Populations**: If the populations of the two buildings are already equal (`total_A == total_B`), then `surplus` will be `0`. This would lead to a division by zero error when calculating `bonus_per_moved`. The code should handle this case separately, possibly by returning `0` as the bonus for each moved person since no one needs to move.

3. **Logic of Surplus Removal**: The current logic does not actually remove any people from the more populous building. It just calculates the surplus and the bonus per moved person. The task requires moving people to equalize the population, but this aspect is missing in the current implementation.

To fix these issues, the function should include logic to balance the populations of the two buildings by moving people, and then calculate the bonus based on the number of people moved. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that addresses some of these issues:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = total_A - total_B
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No need to move anyone; bonus is 0

    stayers = total_A + total_B - abs(surplus)
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / abs(surplus)

    # Logic to balance the populations should go here
    # This is a simplified example; actual implementation may involve more complex redistribution logic

    return bonus_per_moved
```

This version includes a check for when the populations are already equal, preventing division by zero. However, the actual redistribution logic to balance the populations is not implemented, which is required by the problem statement.
