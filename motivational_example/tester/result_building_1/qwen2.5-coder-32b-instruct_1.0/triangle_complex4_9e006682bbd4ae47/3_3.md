Let's carefully analyze the solution provided in the code and its annotated comments.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Calculation of Totals**:
   - `total_A`: Sum of all students and administrators at Building A.
   - `total_B`: Sum of all students, administrators, and professors at Building B.

2. **Surplus Calculation**:
   - `surplus`: The absolute difference between `total_A` and `total_B`.

3. **Stayers and Bonus Pool**:
   - `stayers`: The total number of people who stay (i.e., total population minus the surplus).
   - `bonus_pool`: Each stayer contributes $10, so the bonus pool is `stayers * 10`.

4. **Bonus per Moved Person**:
   - `bonus_per_moved`: The bonus pool divided by the surplus (number of people moved).

### Issues with the Solution:
1. **Handling Zero Surplus**:
   - If `total_A` equals `total_B`, then `surplus` will be 0. In this case, the code attempts to divide `bonus_pool` by 0, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

2. **Logic for Stayers**:
   - The logic for calculating `stayers` seems incorrect. The correct calculation should be `total_A + total_B - surplus`, but the interpretation in the comment is not accurate. `stayers` is actually the total number of people minus the surplus, which simplifies to `min(total_A, total_B)`.

3. **Bonus Pool Interpretation**:
   - The comment states `bonus_pool` is `20 * min(total_A, total_B)`, which is incorrect. The actual formula is `bonus_pool = (total_A + total_B - surplus) * 10`, which simplifies to `bonus_pool = (2 * min(total_A, total_B) + max(total_A, total_B) - min(total_A, total_B)) * 10` or `bonus_pool = (max(total_A, total_B) + min(total_A, total_B)) * 10 - surplus * 10`.

### Corrected Solution:
To address these issues, we need to handle the case when `surplus` is zero and ensure the correct calculation of `bonus_pool`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No surplus, no need to move anyone, hence bonus is 0
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Explanation:
- **Zero Surplus**: If `total_A` equals `total_B`, the function now correctly returns `0` since no one needs to be moved.
- **Bonus Calculation**: The bonus is calculated based on the remaining people (`stayers`) contributing $10 each, and the pool is divided equally among the moved individuals.

This corrected solution should work as expected and handle edge cases appropriately.
