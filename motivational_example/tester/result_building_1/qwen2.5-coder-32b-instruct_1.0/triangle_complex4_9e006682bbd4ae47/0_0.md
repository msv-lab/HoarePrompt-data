The solution provided has some logical issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Calculation of `bonus_pool`**:
   - According to the problem statement, the bonus pool should be created by every staying person at both buildings contributing $10. This means `stayers` should be `total_A + total_B - surplus`, which is correct. However, the statement that `bonus_pool` is equal to `20 * min(total_A, total_B)` is incorrect. Instead, `bonus_pool` should be `stayers * 10`.

2. **Handling of `surplus`**:
   - The calculation of `surplus` as `abs(total_A - total_B)` is correct. However, if `surplus` is 0, it means both buildings already have an equal number of people, and no one needs to be moved. In this case, the bonus per moved person is undefined (division by zero), but logically, there is no need to calculate a bonus because no one is moving.

3. **Returning the bonus**:
   - If `surplus` is 0, the function should handle this case appropriately. One way to handle it could be to return 0 or None since no bonus is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No need to move anyone, so no bonus
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    return bonus_per_moved
```

This function now correctly handles the case where the surplus is 0 and avoids division by zero errors. It also accurately calculates the bonus per moved person based on the total number of people who stay at both buildings.
