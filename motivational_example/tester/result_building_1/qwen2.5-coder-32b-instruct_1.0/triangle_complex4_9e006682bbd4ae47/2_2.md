Let's carefully analyze the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Input:** Five lists representing the number of first-semester students, administrators, and professors in two buildings (A and B).
- **Constraints:** There are 12 classes in Building A and 16 classes in Building B.
- **Objective:** Equalize the number of people in both buildings by removing people from the more populous building. Calculate a bonus for each moved person based on a bonus pool contributed by every staying person ($10 per person).

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Total Population Calculation:**
   - `total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)`: Sum of all people in Building A.
   - `total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)`: Sum of all people in Building B.

2. **Surplus Calculation:**
   - `surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)`: The absolute difference between the populations of the two buildings.

3. **Bonus Pool Calculation:**
   - `stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus`: Total number of people who will stay after balancing the buildings.
   - `bonus_pool = stayers * 10`: Bonus pool amount where each staying person contributes $10.

4. **Bonus Per Moved Person Calculation:**
   - `bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus`: The bonus per person moved from the more populous building to the less populous one.

### Issues in the Provided Solution:
- **Logic Flaw:** The calculation of the `stayers` and `bonus_pool` is incorrect.
  - `stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus` should be `stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus`. However, the key issue is that the formula for `bonus_pool` is not correctly derived.
  - The formula `bonus_pool = stayers * 10` implies that the bonus pool is derived only from the staying people, which is correct in terms of logic, but the calculation of `stayers` seems off.
- **Handling Zero Surplus:** If `surplus` is zero (both buildings have the same population), dividing by `surplus` will cause a division by zero error.

### Corrected Solution:
Let's correct the solution by ensuring that we handle the surplus and bonus calculations properly.

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No need to move anyone, so no bonus is given
    
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved

# Example usage:
students_A = [20] * 12
admins_A = [5] * 12
students_B = [15] * 16
admins_B = [3] * 16
profs_B = [2] * 16

# Expected output: The bonus per moved person when balancing the buildings
print(func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B))
```

### Explanation:
- **Handling Zero Surplus:** Added a check to return `0` if the surplus is zero, avoiding division by zero.
- **Correct Logic:** The logic for calculating `bonus_pool` remains the same, but now the surplus handling is correctly addressed.

This corrected solution should now properly calculate the bonus per moved person while avoiding potential errors.
