Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `students_A`: List of 12 integers representing the number of first-semester students per class at Building A.
   - `admins_A`: List of 12 integers representing the number of administrators per class at Building A.
   - `students_B`: List of 16 integers representing the number of first-semester students per class at Building B.
   - `admins_B`: List of 16 integers representing the number of administrators per class at Building B.
   - `profs_B`: List of 16 integers representing the number of professors per class at Building B.

2. **Outputs**:
   - Calculate the number of people in Building A (`total_A`).
   - Calculate the number of people in Building B (`total_B`).
   - Determine the surplus, which is the absolute difference between `total_A` and `total_B`.
   - Calculate the bonus pool contributed by all the people in both buildings.
   - Compute the bonus per moved person based on the bonus pool and the surplus.

### Code Analysis
Here is the provided function with annotations for clarity:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    # Calculate total number of people in Building A
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    
    # Calculate total number of people in Building B
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    
    # Calculate the surplus (absolute difference between the two totals)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    # Calculate the number of people who will stay (i.e., the minimum of the two totals)
    stayers = total_A + total_B - surplus
    
    # Calculate the bonus pool (every staying person contributes $10)
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    # Calculate the bonus per moved person
    if surplus == 0:
        bonus_per_moved = 0  # No one needs to be moved, so bonus is 0
    else:
        bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Calculation of Totals**:
   - `total_A` is calculated correctly as the sum of `students_A` and `admins_A`.
   - `total_B` is calculated correctly as the sum of `students_B`, `admins_B`, and `profs_B`.

2. **Surplus Calculation**:
   - The surplus is correctly calculated as the absolute difference between `total_A` and `total_B`.

3. **Stayers Calculation**:
   - The number of stayers is correctly calculated as `total_A + total_B - surplus`, which simplifies to the smaller of the two totals (`min(total_A, total_B)`).

4. **Bonus Pool Calculation**:
   - The bonus pool is correctly calculated as `stayers * 10`.

5. **Bonus Per Moved Person Calculation**:
   - The bonus per moved person is correctly calculated as `bonus_pool / surplus`. If there is no surplus (i.e., `total_A == total_B`), the bonus per moved person should logically be 0.

### Conclusion
The code appears to be logically correct and accurately implements the problem requirements. However, there is a minor improvement to handle the case where `surplus` is zero to avoid division by zero error. This is already handled in the provided code by setting `bonus_per_moved` to 0 when `surplus` is 0.

Thus, the solution is correct.
