Let's carefully analyze the provided solution step-by-step.

### Understanding the Problem

We need to make sure both buildings have an equal number of people. To do this, we may need to remove some people from the more populous building. The bonus pool is created by every staying person at both buildings contributing $10. We then calculate the bonus for each moved person.

### Analysis of the Provided Solution

The given solution calculates the total number of people in each building and determines the surplus (the difference in population between the two buildings). Then, it calculates the bonus pool based on the number of people staying in both buildings (i.e., the total number of people minus the surplus).

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Bonus Pool Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the bonus pool as `stayers * 10`, where `stayers` is `total_A + total_B - surplus`. This calculation is incorrect because `stayers` represents the total number of people minus the surplus, which is not necessarily the number of people staying. Instead, it should be `total_A + total_B - surplus`, which is already the total number of people minus the surplus (or equivalently, `min(total_A, total_B) + max(total_A, total_B) - surplus`). However, the key point is that the bonus pool should be calculated based on the number of people staying, which is `min(total_A, total_B)` (since all people in the less populated building will stay, and some people will be removed from the more populated building).

2. **Bonus Per Moved Person Calculation**:
   - The bonus per moved person is correctly calculated as `bonus_pool / surplus`, but the `bonus_pool` is calculated incorrectly as mentioned above.

### Corrected Solution

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(students_A, admins_A, students_B, admins_B, profs_B):
    total_A = sum(students_A) + sum(admins_A)
    total_B = sum(students_B) + sum(admins_B) + sum(profs_B)
    surplus = abs(total_A - total_B)
    
    if surplus == 0:
        return 0  # No surplus means no need to move anyone, hence no bonus
    
    # Calculate the number of people staying in both buildings
    stayers = min(total_A, total_B)
    
    # Calculate the bonus pool
    bonus_pool = stayers * 10
    
    # Calculate the bonus per moved person
    bonus_per_moved = bonus_pool / surplus
    
    return bonus_per_moved
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution
- **Surplus Calculation**: The surplus is the absolute difference between the total number of people in Building A and Building B.
- **Stayers Calculation**: The number of people staying in both buildings is the smaller of the two totals (`min(total_A, total_B)`).
- **Bonus Pool Calculation**: The bonus pool is calculated based on the number of people staying (`stayers * 10`).
- **Bonus Per Moved Person Calculation**: The bonus per moved person is the bonus pool divided by the surplus.

### Conclusion
The original solution had an incorrect calculation of the bonus pool. The corrected solution addresses this issue and ensures the bonus is calculated accurately.
