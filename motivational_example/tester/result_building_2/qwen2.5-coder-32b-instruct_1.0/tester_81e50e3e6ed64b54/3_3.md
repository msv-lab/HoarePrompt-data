To generate the test cases, we need to carefully consider the problem description and constraints. Here are a few test cases that cover various scenarios:

1. **Basic Test Case**: Simple numbers to check basic functionality.
2. **Edge Case**: Maximum and minimum possible numbers.
3. **Equal Population**: Both buildings already have equal populations.
4. **Large Numbers**: Large values to ensure there are no overflow issues.
5. **Different Distributions**: Different distributions of people across classes to ensure the function calculates correctly.

Let's write the test cases:

```python
from program import *
