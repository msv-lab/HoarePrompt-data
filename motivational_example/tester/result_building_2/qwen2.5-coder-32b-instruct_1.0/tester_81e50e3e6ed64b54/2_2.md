Certainly! Below is the Python script with assertions to test the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description. 

```python
from program import *

# Helper function to capture output if needed (not used in this case)

    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
    captured_output = io.StringIO()
    sys.stdout = captured_output
    func()
    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
    return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
