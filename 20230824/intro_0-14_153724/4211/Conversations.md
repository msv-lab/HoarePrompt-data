I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
2 5
" the output was "Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/46/8ybh48tn40l32kbzy6n99p380000gn/T/tmp30vcymip.py", line 13, in <module>

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code provided is meant to find the maximum possible sum of the elements of a sequence A based on the given sequence B. The code takes N as input and then reads the sequence B. It initializes the maximum sum as the last element of B and then iterates over the elements of B in reverse order. For each element, it finds the maximum value between the current element of B and the next element of B and updates the maximum sum accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum sum.

However, there are a few bugs in the code that need to be addressed:
1. The loop in line 8 iterates from `N-2` to `0` in reverse order. However, it should iterate from `N-2` to `1` in reverse order. This is because `range(N-2, -1, -1)` will exclude the last element.
2. In line 11, the code is trying to access `B[i+1]`, which will result in an `IndexError` when `i` is equal to `N-2` because `B` only has `N-1` elements.
3. The initialization of `max_sum` in line 6 should be the sum of the last two elements of `B`, not just the last element. This is because the maximum sum of the elements of A should include the last element of B.

These bugs impact the functionality of the program and prevent it from producing the correct output.

### ANALYSIS
The code provided is meant to find the maximum possible sum of the elements of a sequence A based on the given sequence B. The code takes N as input and then reads the sequence B. It initializes the maximum sum as the sum of the last two elements of B and then iterates over the elements of B in reverse order. For each element, it finds the maximum value between the current element of B and the next element of B and updates the maximum sum accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum sum.

However, there are a few bugs in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The loop in line 15 iterates from `N-3` to `0` in reverse order. This is incorrect because the loop variable `i` should go up to `N-2` to include the comparison of the last two elements of B. The loop should be `range(N-3, -1, -1)`.

2. In line 20, the code should add the maximum value `max_value` to the maximum sum `max_sum`. Currently, it is adding the maximum value twice. The line should be `max_sum += max_value`.

These bugs impact the functionality of the program and prevent it from producing the correct output. Let's fix these issues in the code.

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE
```python
# Read the input N
N = int(input())

# Read the input sequence B
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the maximum sum as the sum of the last two elements of B
max_sum = B[-1] + B[-2]

# Iterate over the elements of B in reverse order
for i in range(N-3, -1, -1):
    # Find the maximum value between the current element of B and the next element of B
    max_value = max(B[i], B[i+1])
    # Update the maximum sum by adding the maximum value
    max_sum += max_value

# Print the maximum sum
print(max_sum)
```
Now the code should correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the elements of sequence A based on the given sequence B.
