I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Today, the memorable AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 takes place. On this occasion, Takahashi would like to give an integer to Ringo.

As the name of the contest is AtCoder Beginner Contest 100, Ringo would be happy if he is given a positive integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.
Find the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy.

-----Constraints-----
 - D is 0, 1 or 2.
 - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D N

-----Output-----
Print the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.

-----Sample Input-----
0 5

-----Sample Output-----
5

The integers that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times (that is, not divisible by 100) are as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...

Thus, the 5-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 5.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### Requirement

if D == 0:
    print(N)
elif D == 1:
    print(N * 100)
else:
    print(N * 10000)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "0 100
" the output was "100
" but the expected output was "101
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "0 100
" the output was "100
" but the expected output was "101
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Feedback:

Overall, the code seems to have a logical error in calculating the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. It also appears to be missing some edge cases.

Here are the bugs I found in the code:

**1. Incorrect calculation for D = 0:**

**Bug:** For D = 0, the code should simply return N itself. However, the current code is directly printing N, which is incorrect.

**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 0. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times.

**2. Incorrect calculation for D = 1:**

**Bug:** For D = 1, the code is multiplying N by 100 and printing the result. However, this logic is incorrect as it is not finding the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 time.

**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 1. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 time.

**3. Incorrect calculation for D = 2:**

**Bug:** For D = 2, the code is multiplying N by 10000 and printing the result. However, this logic is incorrect as it is not finding the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times.

**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 2. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times.

**4. Missing edge case handling:**

**Bug:** The code does not handle the edge cases where D is not within the given constraints, that is, D can only be 0, 1, or 2.

**Impact:** This can lead to unexpected behavior if D is not within the valid range. The program should handle and provide a proper error message for invalid input for D.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified as follows:

1. Check if D is equal to 0, and if so, return N.
2. Check if D is equal to 1, and if so, return N multiplied by 100.
3. Check if D is equal to 2, and if so, return N multiplied by 10,000.
4. In case D does not match any of the valid values (0, 1, 2), print an error message stating that D is invalid.

Remember, I am providing feedback only and not suggesting any solutions. Please let me know if you have any questions.

The bug has been identified and the fixes have been suggested based on the feedback. I will now implement the fixes and provide the updated Python code.

Updated Python code with the fixes implemented:

```python
D, N = map(int, input().split())

if D == 0:
    print(N)
elif D == 1:
    print(N * 101)
elif D == 2:
    print(N * 10100)
else:
    print("Invalid value for D. D should be 0, 1, or 2.")
```

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
