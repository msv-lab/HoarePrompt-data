          "feedback": "## Feedback:\n\nOverall, the code seems to have a logical error in calculating the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. It also appears to be missing some edge cases.\n\nHere are the bugs I found in the code:\n\n**1. Incorrect calculation for D = 0:**\n\n**Bug:** For D = 0, the code should simply return N itself. However, the current code is directly printing N, which is incorrect.\n\n**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 0. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times.\n\n**2. Incorrect calculation for D = 1:**\n\n**Bug:** For D = 1, the code is multiplying N by 100 and printing the result. However, this logic is incorrect as it is not finding the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 time.\n\n**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 1. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 1 time.\n\n**3. Incorrect calculation for D = 2:**\n\n**Bug:** For D = 2, the code is multiplying N by 10000 and printing the result. However, this logic is incorrect as it is not finding the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times.\n\n**Impact:** This will lead to incorrect results when D = 2. The program should return the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly 2 times.\n\n**4. Missing edge case handling:**\n\n**Bug:** The code does not handle the edge cases where D is not within the given constraints, that is, D can only be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n**Impact:** This can lead to unexpected behavior if D is not within the valid range. The program should handle and provide a proper error message for invalid input for D.\n\nTo fix these issues, the code needs to be modified as follows:\n\n1. Check if D is equal to 0, and if so, return N.\n2. Check if D is equal to 1, and if so, return N multiplied by 100.\n3. Check if D is equal to 2, and if so, return N multiplied by 10,000.\n4. In case D does not match any of the valid values (0, 1, 2), print an error message stating that D is invalid.\n\nRemember, I am providing feedback only and not suggesting any solutions. Please let me know if you have any questions.",
