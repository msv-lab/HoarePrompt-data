The program is not correctly subtracting 1 from the scores of other players when a player correctly answers a question. This is because the line `scores[A-1] -= 1` is only subtracting 1 from the current player's score, but it should subtract 1 from all other players' scores. To fix this, we need to iterate over all players (except the current player) and subtract 1 from their scores.\n\n2. The program is not correctly checking whether each player survived the game. The logic in the loop `for score in scores` checks if the score is greater than 0, but it should also check if the score is greater than or equal to 0. This is because players with 0 points should also be considered as surviving the game.\n\n### BUG 1: Incorrect subtraction of points from other players' scores\nThe bug occurs when subtracting points from other players' scores. Currently, the code only subtracts 1 point from the current player's score, but it should subtract 1 point from all other players' scores.\n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect check for surviving players\nThe bug occurs when checking if each player survived the game. Currently, the code checks if the score is greater than 0, but it should also check if the score is greater than or equal to 0. Players with 0 points should also be considered as surviving the game.\n\n### IMPACT OF THE BUG 1:\nThe impact of this bug is that when a player correctly answers a question, only their score is decremented by 1, while the scores of other players remain unchanged. This leads to incorrect results as the scores of other players should also be decreased by 1 when a question is answered correctly. Consequently, some players who should have been eliminated may survive the game.\n\n### IMPACT OF THE BUG 2:\nThe impact of this bug is that players with 0 points are considered as not surviving the game. This is incorrect as players with 0 points should also be considered as surviving the game. Consequently, some players who should have survived the game may be incorrectly marked as not surviving.\n\n### PLAN\nTo fix bug 1, I will modify the code to subtract 1 point from all other players' scores when a question is answered correctly. To do this, I will iterate over the range of N and subtract 1 from the score of each player except the current player.\n\nTo fix bug 2, I will update the logic in the loop `for score in scores` to check if the score is greater than or equal to 0.\n\n### DRY RUN\nLet's do a dry run of the code with the given sample input to see the impact of the bugs and check if the proposed fixes will produce the correct output.\n\nGiven input: `6 3 4\n3\n1\n3\n2`\n\nInitial scores: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n\n1. Player 3 answers correctly:\n   - Updated scores: `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2]`\n\n2. Player 1 answers correctly:\n   - Updated scores: `[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n3. Player 3 answers correctly:\n   - Updated scores: `[1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n4. Player 2 answers correctly:\n   - Updated scores: `[0, 0, 1, -1, -1, -1]`\n\nExpected output: `\"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\"`\n\n### BUG-FREE CODE\n```python\nN, K, Q = map(int, input().split())\nscores = [K] * N\n\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    A = int(input())\n    \n    # Subtract 1 from scores of other players\n    for i in range(N):\n        if i+1 != A:\n            scores[i] -= 1\n\nfor score in scores:\n    if score >= 0:  # Check for surviving players\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n```",
