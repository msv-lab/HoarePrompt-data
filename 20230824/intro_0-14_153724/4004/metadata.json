          "feedback": "### Observations\n\nThe code provided attempts to find the minimum non-negative integer value D such that if this value is added to or subtracted from each element in the list, all the elements will be equal. \n\nHere are the observations on the issues in the code:\n\n1. The code calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list `a`, but this is not necessary for finding the minimum non-negative integer value D. It only needs to find the target value.\n\n2. The code calculates the average of the minimum and maximum values and assigns it to the variable `target`. However, this is incorrect. Taking the average of the minimum and maximum values will not always give the desired target value. \n\n3. If the difference between the target value and an element in the list is odd, it is not possible to make all elements equal by adding or subtracting a single non-negative integer value D. In such cases, the code should output -1. However, the code currently checks if the difference is divisible by 2 instead of checking if it is odd.\n\n4. The code calculates the difference between the target value and each element in the list inside the loop, but it should calculate the difference once and store it in a variable before the loop.\n\n5. The code should print the minimum non-negative integer value D even when it is 0, instead of exiting the program.\n\n### Updated Python Code\n\nHere's the updated code that addresses the issues mentioned above:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Find the target value that all elements should be equal to\ntarget = sum(a) // n\n\n# Iterate through each element in the array\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Calculate the difference between the current element and the target value\n    diff = target - a[i]\n\n    # Check if the difference is odd\n    if diff % 2 != 0:\n        print(-1)\n        exit()\n\n# Print the minimum non-negative integer value D\nprint(abs(diff // 2))\n```\n\nThis updated code should produce the correct output for the given example inputs.",
