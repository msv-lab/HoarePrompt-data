I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.
You can perform the following operation on S any number of times:
Operation: Choose two distinct lowercase English letters c_1 and c_2, then replace every occurrence of c_1 with c_2, and every occurrence of c_2 with c_1.
Determine if S and T can be made equal by performing the operation zero or more times.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - |S| = |T|
 - S and T consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

-----Output-----
If S and T can be made equal, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
azzel
apple

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

azzel can be changed to apple, as follows:
 - Choose e as c_1 and l as c_2. azzel becomes azzle.
 - Choose z as c_1 and p as c_2. azzle becomes apple.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "chokudai
redcoder
" the output was "Yes
" but the expected output was "No
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
Let's first understand the intended logic of the code:
1. Create an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping of characters from `S` to `T`.
2. Iterate through each character of `S` and `T`.
3. If the character in `S` is already mapped to a different character in `T` and the character in `T` is different from the current character in `T`, return "No" as it is not possible to make `S` and `T` equal.
4. If the character in `S` is not yet mapped, add the mapping from the character in `S` to the current character in `T` to the `mapping` dictionary.
5. Return "Yes" as it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal.

Now let's go through the bugs and their impact on the code's functionality:

### BUG 1: Incorrect condition in line 11
The condition in line 11 should check if the character in `T` is different from the current character in `S`, not `T`. This is because we want to check if the mapping is correct, not if the character in `T` is the same as the character in `S`.

### IMPACT: The code will not correctly determine if it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal. It may return "Yes" even if the characters are mapped incorrectly.

### BUG 2: Incorrect indentation of line 13
The line 13 should be indented inside the `if` statement in line 10. Since it is not indented correctly, the line is executed for every iteration of the loop instead of only when the character in `S` is not yet mapped.

### IMPACT: The `mapping` dictionary will be updated for every iteration of the loop, even if the character in `S` is already mapped. This may cause incorrect mappings and result in incorrect determination of whether it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal.

### BUG 3: Incorrect return values
The prompt requires printing "Yes" or "No" without the quotation marks. But the code is returning the strings "Yes" and "No" with the quotation marks.

### IMPACT: The code will not produce the correct output format as required by the prompt.

### Overall Impact:
Due to the above bugs, the code will not correctly determine if it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal. It may produce incorrect mappings and output format.

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE
The corrected code should fix the bugs mentioned above. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def can_make_equal(S, T):
    # create a dictionary to store the mapping of characters from S to T
    mapping = {}
    
    # iterate through each character of S and T
    for i in range(len(S)):
        # if the character in S is already mapped to a different character in T
        # and the character in T is different from the current character in S
        if S[i] in mapping and mapping[S[i]] != T[i]:
            # return No, as it is not possible to make S and T equal
            return "No"
        
        # if the character in S is not yet mapped
        # add the mapping from the character in S to the current character in T
        if S[i] not in mapping:
            mapping[S[i]] = T[i]
            
    # return Yes, as it is possible to make S and T equal
    return "Yes"

S = input()
T = input()

result = can_make_equal(S, T)
print(result)
```

### Summary of Changes Made:
1. Modified the condition in line 11 to check if the character in `T` is different from the current character in `S`.
2. Corrected the indentation of line 13 to ensure it is executed only when the character in `S` is not yet mapped.
3. Changed the return values to return the strings "Yes" and "No" without the quotation marks.
