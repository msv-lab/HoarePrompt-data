          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\nLet's first understand the intended logic of the code:\n1. Create an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping of characters from `S` to `T`.\n2. Iterate through each character of `S` and `T`.\n3. If the character in `S` is already mapped to a different character in `T` and the character in `T` is different from the current character in `T`, return \"No\" as it is not possible to make `S` and `T` equal.\n4. If the character in `S` is not yet mapped, add the mapping from the character in `S` to the current character in `T` to the `mapping` dictionary.\n5. Return \"Yes\" as it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal.\n\nNow let's go through the bugs and their impact on the code's functionality:\n\n### BUG 1: Incorrect condition in line 11\nThe condition in line 11 should check if the character in `T` is different from the current character in `S`, not `T`. This is because we want to check if the mapping is correct, not if the character in `T` is the same as the character in `S`.\n\n### IMPACT: The code will not correctly determine if it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal. It may return \"Yes\" even if the characters are mapped incorrectly.\n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect indentation of line 13\nThe line 13 should be indented inside the `if` statement in line 10. Since it is not indented correctly, the line is executed for every iteration of the loop instead of only when the character in `S` is not yet mapped.\n\n### IMPACT: The `mapping` dictionary will be updated for every iteration of the loop, even if the character in `S` is already mapped. This may cause incorrect mappings and result in incorrect determination of whether it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal.\n\n### BUG 3: Incorrect return values\nThe prompt requires printing \"Yes\" or \"No\" without the quotation marks. But the code is returning the strings \"Yes\" and \"No\" with the quotation marks.\n\n### IMPACT: The code will not produce the correct output format as required by the prompt.\n\n### Overall Impact:\nDue to the above bugs, the code will not correctly determine if it is possible to make `S` and `T` equal. It may produce incorrect mappings and output format.",
