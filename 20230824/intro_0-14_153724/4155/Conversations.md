I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
In a flower bed, there are N flowers, numbered 1,2,......,N. Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0.
You are given a sequence h=\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \leq  k \leq N), by repeating the following "watering" operation:
 - Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \leq x \leq r.
Find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N  \leq 100
 - 0 \leq h_i \leq 100
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
h_1 h_2 h_3 ...... h_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
4
1 2 2 1

-----Sample Output-----
2

The minimum number of watering operations required is 2.
One way to achieve it is:
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(1,3).
 - Perform the operation with (l,r)=(2,4).
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            #### REVIEWER

The code provided appears to be attempting to determine the minimum number of watering operations required to change the heights of the flowers in a flower bed. However, there are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through them step by step:

1. The loop range is incorrect:  
The code iterates over `range(1, N)`, which means it skips checking the first flower's height. This will cause incorrect results since the first flower's height also needs to be considered.

2. The condition for checking if watering is needed is incorrect:  
The code checks if `heights[i] < heights[i-1]` before performing an operation. However, this condition does not cover all cases where a watering operation is necessary. For example, if the heights are [2, 1, 2, 1], the code would not detect the need for watering between the second and third flowers.

3. The operation increments the wrong flower height:  
The code increments `heights[i-1]` instead of `heights[i]` when performing a watering operation. This will lead to inconsistent and incorrect results.

Let me know if you need any further assistance in understanding these bugs.

### BUG FIX
To fix the bugs in the code, the following changes need to be made:

1. Change the loop range:
   The loop should iterate over `range(N)` instead of `range(1, N)`. This will include the first flower in the iteration.

2. Change the condition for checking if watering is needed:
   Instead of checking `heights[i] < heights[i-1]`, we need to check if `heights[i] <= heights[i-1]` because even if the heights are equal, we still need to perform a watering operation.

3. Change the operation to increment the correct flower height:
   Instead of incrementing `heights[i-1]`, we should increment `heights[i]` when performing a watering operation.

The corrected code is as follows:
```python
N = int(input())
heights = list(map(int, input().split()))

operations = 0
for i in range(N):
    if heights[i] <= heights[i-1]:
        operations += heights[i-1] - heights[i]
        heights[i] = heights[i-1]

print(operations)
```

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
