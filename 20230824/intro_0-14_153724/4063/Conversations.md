I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
 - A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
 - A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

-----Problem Statement-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N is an even number.
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

-----Sample Input-----
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

-----Sample Output-----
2

If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
9 1 4 4 6 7
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS
1. The approach of counting the number of even difficulties is incorrect. The problem states that a problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs, and a problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs. So, the correct approach should be to check the number of problems for both ARCs and ABCs for each possible value of K and count the number of choices where the counts are equal.

### IMPACT
The current code is failing to provide the correct number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs the same. As a result, the output is incorrect, which will lead to incorrect decisions for Takahashi.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
1. Modify the counting approach to check the number of problems for both ARCs and ABCs for each possible value of K.
2. Fix the logic of counting the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs by using two separate counters.
3. Implement a loop to iterate over all possible values of K.
4. Check if the counts for ARCs and ABCs are equal for each value of K and increment a counter for the number of choices where the counts are equal.

### CORRECTED CODE
```python
def count_equal_choices(N, difficulties):
    # Initialize counter for number of choices
    num_choices = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible values of K
    for K in range(1, max(difficulties) + 1):
        # Initialize counters for ARCs and ABCs
        count_ARCs = 0
        count_ABCs = 0
        
        # Count the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs
        for d in difficulties:
            if d >= K:
                count_ARCs += 1
            else:
                count_ABCs += 1
        
        # Check if the counts for ARCs and ABCs are equal
        if count_ARCs == count_ABCs:
            num_choices += 1
    
    return num_choices

# Read input
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Get the number of choices of K
num_choices = count_equal_choices(N, difficulties)

# Print the result
print(num_choices)
```

I apologize for the confusion. The code provided in the question is unrelated to the task of counting the number of choices of the integer K. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def count_equal_choices(N, difficulties):
    # Initialize counter for number of choices
    num_choices = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible values of K
    for K in range(1, max(difficulties) + 1):
        # Initialize counters for ARCs and ABCs
        count_ARCs = 0
        count_ABCs = 0
        
        # Count the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs
        for d in difficulties:
            if d >= K:
                count_ARCs += 1
            else:
                count_ABCs += 1
        
        # Check if the counts for ARCs and ABCs are equal
        if count_ARCs == count_ABCs:
            num_choices += 1
    
    return num_choices

# Read input
N = int(input())
difficulties = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Get the number of choices of K
num_choices = count_equal_choices(N, difficulties)

# Print the result
print(num_choices)
```

This code calculates the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs the same. It iterates over all possible values of K and counts the number of problems for ARCs and ABCs for each value of K. If the counts are equal, it increments the counter for the number of choices. Finally, it prints the result.
