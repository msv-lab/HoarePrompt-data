Incorrect condition for checking if it is possible to heat up the whole house\n```python\nif i + r - 1 >= n:\n```\nThis condition is incorrect because it checks if the last heater can warm up the last element of the array. However, the last heater should be able to warm up elements after its position as well. This condition should be changed to `if i + r - 1 > n`. \n\n#### 2. Incorrect condition for checking if a position can be warmed up by a heater\n```python\nelif i - r + 1 > last_heater:\n```\nThis condition is incorrect because it checks if the current position is out of range for the previous heater. However, it should check if the current position is within the range of the previous heater. This condition should be changed to `elif i - r + 1 > last_heater + r`.\n\n#### 3. Incorrect loop increment\n```python\nelse:\n    i += 1\n```\nThis increment is incorrect because it only increments `i` by `1` when the current position does not contain a heater. However, it should increment `i` by `r` in all cases. This increment should be changed to `i += r`.\n\n#### 4. Missing condition for checking if the last element can be warmed up by a heater\nCurrently, there is no condition to check if the last element of the array can be warmed up by a heater. This needs to be added before the last print statement.\n\n#### Impact on functionality\nThese bugs impact the functionality of the program as they lead to incorrect results. The program may give `1` as the output even when it is impossible to warm up the whole house, and it may give `-1` as the output even when it is possible to warm up the whole house.\n\n#### Bugs\n1.
