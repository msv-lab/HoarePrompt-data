I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Liam (angryneeson52) is playing his favorite tower defense game! This game involves destroying minions of his opponent while defending his own villages.

Liam’s favorite attack is an Area of Effect attack. The Area of Effect attack is a perfect circle. Liam simply picks a center and a radius for the attack and every minion in or on that circle gets destroyed! Minions are small enough to be considered points.

The game isn’t as simple as just destroying all minions. Liam must also avoid hitting his villages with his attacks. The attack may touch the walls of a village but must not enter the village. Villages are also perfect circles.

His attack also has a limit on its maximum radius. The attack can be reduced in radius but cannot go above the maximum.

Determine the maximum number of minions Liam can destroy in a single attack without damaging any of his own villages.

-----Input-----
Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input begins with a line with 3 space-separated integers, $n\ m\ r$, where:
 - $n$ ($1\le n \le 10$) is the number of Liam’s villages
 - $m$ ($1 \le m \le 2000$) is the number of opposing minions
 - $r$ ($1 \le r \le 20000$) is the maximum radius of Liam’s Area of Effect attack

The next $n$ lines will each contain 3 space-separated integers $vx\ vy\ vr$ which represent the location ($-20000\le vx, vy \le 20000$) and radius ($1\le vr \le 20000$) of one of Liam’s villages. No two villages will intersect or overlap.

The next $m$ lines will each contain 2 space-separated integers $mx\ my$ which represent the location ($-20000 \le mx, my \le 20000$) of one of the enemy minions. No two minions will occupy the same point, and no enemy minion will be inside any of Liam’s villages.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer representing the maximum number of enemy minions that Liam can destroy with a single attack.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
1 3 3
0 0 1
3 3
-3 3
3 -3
Sample Output 1:
1

Sample Input 2:
1 5 3
0 0 1
3 3
-3 3
3 -3
3 0
0 3
Sample Output 2:
3
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

0 0 1
3 3
-3 3
3 -3
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code has a logical error in the implementation of the attack area. The attack area is currently being defined using the wrong range of indices in the nested for-loop. Instead of iterating over all possible attack centers, the code iterates over all possible pairs of minion locations. This will not cover all possible attack centers and will miss some minions that can be destroyed.

Additionally, there is an error in the calculation of the distance between the attack center and the villages. The calculation currently subtracts the radius of the village from the distance formula, which will result in incorrect distances.

Furthermore, the code checks if the distance from the attack center to each village is greater than the attack radius to determine if the village is outside the attack radius. This logic is incorrect because the attack area is a circle and the distance should be compared to the *sum* of the village radius and the attack radius.

Lastly, the variable `max_destroyed` is not initialized correctly. It is currently initialized to zero, but it should be initialized to negative infinity to ensure that it is updated correctly with the maximum number of destroyed minions.

### BUGS
1. The nested for-loop in the `calculate_max_minions_destroyed` function does not cover all possible attack centers.
2. Incorrect calculation of the distance between the attack center and the villages.
3. Incorrect comparison of the distance to determine if a village is outside the attack radius.
4. Incorrect initialization of `max_destroyed` variable.

### IMPACT
These bugs will result in incorrect determination of the maximum number of minions that can be destroyed. The code may fail to consider some valid attack centers and may miss destroying some minions that can be destroyed. This will lead to incorrect results and the output will not match the expected output.

To fix the bugs in the code, I will make the following changes:

1. Fix the nested for-loop: I will change the nested for-loop to iterate over all possible attack centers within the boundaries defined by the maximum attack radius. This will cover all possible attack centers.

2. Fix the calculation of the distance: I will remove the subtraction of the village radius from the distance formula. This will correctly calculate the distance between the attack center and the villages.

3. Fix the comparison of the distance: I will compare the distance to the sum of the village radius and the attack radius. This will correctly determine if a village is outside the attack radius.

4. Initialize `max_destroyed` correctly: I will initialize `max_destroyed` to negative infinity instead of zero. This will ensure that it is updated correctly with the maximum number of destroyed minions.

Based on these changes, the corrected code is as follows:

```python
def calculate_max_minions_destroyed(n, m, r, villages, minions):
    max_destroyed = float('-inf')

    # Iterate over all possible attack centers
    for i in range(-r, r+1):
        for j in range(-r, r+1):
            center = [i, j]  # Possible attack center

            # Calculate the distance between the attack center and all villages
            distances_from_center = [((v[0] - center[0]) ** 2 + (v[1] - center[1]) ** 2) ** 0.5 for v in villages]

            # Count the number of villages that are outside the attack radius
            villages_outside_radius = sum([distance > v[2] + r for distance, v in zip(distances_from_center, villages)])

            # Calculate the number of minions that can be destroyed
            minions_destroyed = m - villages_outside_radius

            # Update the maximum number of minions destroyed
            max_destroyed = max(max_destroyed, minions_destroyed)

    return max_destroyed

# Read input
n, m, r = map(int, input().split())
villages = []
minions = []
for _ in range(n):
    vx, vy, vr = map(int, input().split())
    villages.append((vx, vy, vr))
for _ in range(m):
    mx, my = map(int, input().split())
    minions.append((mx, my))

# Calculate the maximum number of minions destroyed
result = calculate_max_minions_destroyed(n, m, r, villages, minions)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Now, the code should correctly determine the maximum number of minions that can be destroyed without damaging any of Liam's villages.
