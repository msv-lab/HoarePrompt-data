          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n- The code above is trying to calculate the minimum expected duration of a train trip from an origin to a destination.\n- The code contains several bugs that need to be fixed.\n\n### BUGS\n1. ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hamburg'\n   - The bug occurs in line 114 when trying to convert the input string to integers.\n   - The bug is caused by not properly separating the input string.\n   - To fix this, we need to split the input string into separate variables.\n\n2. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'heapq'\n   - The bug occurs in line 55 when trying to import the 'heapq' module.\n   - The bug is caused by not importing the 'heapq' module before using it.\n   - To fix this, we need to import the 'heapq' module.\n\n3. NameError: name 'format' is not defined\n   - The bug occurs in line 128 when trying to format the result.\n   - The bug is caused by not importing the 'format' function from the 'builtins' module.\n   - To fix this, we need to import the 'format' function from the 'builtins' module.\n\n4. UnboundLocalError: local variable 'origin' referenced before assignment\n   - The bug occurs in line 45 when trying to assign a value to the variable 'origin'.\n   - The bug is caused by not properly assigning a value to the variable 'origin'.\n   - To fix this, we need to change the variable name to 'O'.\n\n### IMPACT\n- The first bug (ValueError) prevents the code from correctly reading the input and causes a ValueError when trying to convert a string to an integer. This prevents the code from executing properly and results in a traceback error.\n- The second bug (ModuleNotFoundError) prevents the code from importing the 'heapq' module, which is needed to use the heapq functions. This will cause an error when trying to use heapq functions.\n- The third bug (NameError) prevents the code from using the 'format' function to format the result. This will cause an error when trying to print the formatted result.\n- The fourth bug (UnboundLocalError) prevents the code from assigning a value to the variable 'origin'. This will cause an error when trying to read the input and retrieve the value of 'origin'.",
