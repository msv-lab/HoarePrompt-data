I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
In a little town called Križ live $N$ people. Each of them has borrowed some money from exactly one other inhabitant. Now the time has come to pay back all the debts, but the problem is that everybody has spent all of their money!

The major of Križ has decided to solve this problem. The town will give money to a few people so that they can pay back their debts. When some people get their money back, a chain reaction is started – for example: person $A$ gets money from the city. Person $A$ uses that money to pay the debt toward person $B$. Person $B$ then uses that money to pay the debt towards person $C$ etc. If person $B$ didn’t have enough money to pay back the debt, they wait until they get enough. If they have more than enough money, person $B$ will keep what is left after payback.

Another example: if two people live in Križ, and they owe $$100$ to each other, the town will give $$100$ to one of them so they can pay back the debt to the other one.

Your task is to calculate the minimum total amount of money the town has to give to some subset of the inhabitants so that after the payback protocol described above all debts are payed.

-----Input-----
First line of input contains one integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 200000$), number of inhabitants of Križ. They are numbered from $1$ to $N$.

The following $N$ lines contain two integers, separated by space. In the $i$’th of those lines, the first number $A_ i$ represents the id of the person $i$’th person owes money to ($1 \le A_ i \le N$, $A_ i \ne i$), and the second number $B_ i$ represents the ammount of the debt in $ ($1 \le B_ i \le 10000$).

-----Output-----
The first and only line of output should contain one integer – the minimum total ammount of money town has to give to its inhabitants so all debts are returned.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
4
2 100
1 100
4 70
3 70
Sample Output 1:
170

Sample Input 2:
3
2 120
3 50
2 80
Sample Output 2:
150
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

The given code tries to find the minimum total amount of money the town has to give to some subset of the inhabitants so that all debts are paid back. It uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find all connected components and calculate the total amount of debts for each connected component. Then, it updates the minimum amount of money needed to be given by the town.

I have identified a few bugs in the code:

1. **Indexing Issue**: The indexing of `vis` and `debts` arrays is zero-based, while the input/output indexing is one-based. This leads to incorrect indexing and incorrect results. To fix this, we need to subtract 1 from the indices when accessing `vis` and `debts`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Debts**: The code calculates the total amount of debts incorrectly. It sums up only the second element of each debt, which represents the amount owed, without considering the direction of the debts. The total amount of debts should be calculated by summing up the amounts owed and subtracting the amounts owed to others. To fix this, we need to consider the direction of debts and adjust the calculation of the total debts accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Initialization**: The minimum money needed is initialized with `float('inf')`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized with 0, as the town can give 0 money to some inhabitants if they don't owe any debts.

4. **Inconsistent Variable Naming**: The variable `$N$` represents the number of inhabitants, but it is referred to as `N` in the code. It would be more consistent to use a lowercase `n` for this variable.

5. **Improper Utilization of DFS**: The DFS algorithm is used to find all connected components and determine the money needed, but it is missing the logic to properly subtract the money received from others within a connected component. This leads to incorrect results. We need to modify the DFS logic to properly subtract the money received from others within a connected component.

6. **Inefficient Calculation of Total Debts**: The code currently calculates the total amount of debts by summing up the amounts owed and subtracting the amounts owed to others for each person. This leads to inefficiency as it recalculates the total debts for each connected component multiple times. To improve efficiency, we can calculate the total amount of debts while performing the DFS algorithm only once and update the minimum money needed accordingly.

Overall, the code needs improvements in handling indexing, calculating the total debts, initializing variables, utilizing DFS, and improving efficiency.
