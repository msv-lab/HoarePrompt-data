I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Raelynn is trying to learn the newest craze in modern art: Tape Art! This wonderful new type of art is created by taking a wooden plank and pieces of tape of different colors. Each artwork is constructed by taking multiple pieces of tape and placing them on the plank. For each color that appears in the artwork, only a single piece of tape is used. Tapes can be placed on top of each other in which case the tape placed last obscures already placed pieces of tape with which it overlaps. 

Raelynn has decided the best way to learn is by copying Sheila, the world-famous tape artist. Unfortunately those pieces of art are under lock and key and Raelynn can see only pictures of these marvels. Since Raelynn is having trouble reverse engineering the artwork from the picture, she has hired you to create a set of instructions with which she can copy the art.

Since Raelynn is spoiled by the ease of IKEA catalogs she requires instructions to be given in the following format: there should only be one instruction per color of tape and instructions should be given in the order they should be executed.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single test case. The first line of this test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), where $n$ is the length of the tape art in inches. The next line contains $n$ integers $c_ i$ ($1 \le c_ i \le n$) representing the color of one inch of the plank. Planks are divided into $n$ $1$-inch sections numbered $1$ through $n$.

-----Output-----
Output any set of instructions that, when executed, will result in the tape art given by the input. The set of instructions should start with the number of instructions that follow. Each instruction must consist of three numbers: $l$$r$ $c$ where $[l, r]$ represents the inclusive range on which the tape should be placed and $c$ represents the color of the tape piece.

Output the string “IMPOSSIBLE” if the piece of tape art cannot be reconstructed using only one piece of each color (Sheila must have broken the rules to make it or this piece is a forgery).

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
6
1 2 3 3 2 1
Sample Output 1:
3
1 6 1
2 5 2
3 4 3

Sample Input 2:
4
1 2 1 2
Sample Output 2:
IMPOSSIBLE
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6
1 2 3 3 2 1
" the output was "IMPOSSIBLE
" but the expected output was "3
1 6 1
2 5 2
3 4 3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## REVIEW

Looking at the code, there are several bugs and issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Output Handling:** The code returns the string "IMPOSSIBLE" if there are multiple instances of a color, but it should return a list of instructions that would result in the tape art if it is possible. The code should handle this case correctly and return the correct set of instructions.

2. **Counting Color Instances:** The code correctly counts the number of instances of each color, but it doesn't check for a special case: if there are more color instances than the length of the plank. In this case, it is impossible to create tape art with only one piece of each color, so the code should return "IMPOSSIBLE". This case is not currently handled in the code.

3. **Loop Iteration Issue:** The loop that creates the instructions starts from 0 instead of 1. This causes the first piece of tape to be missed in the instructions. The loop should start from 1 to include the first piece of tape.

4. **Current Color Initialization:** The variable `current_color` is initialized as 0, but color values start from 1. This causes the first piece of tape to have a color of 0 instead of the actual color. The variable should be initialized as `None` to avoid this issue.

5. **Loop Iteration Range:** The loop that creates the instructions should iterate until `n-1` instead of `n` to avoid out of range errors when accessing `colors[i]` in the last iteration.

6. **Returning Instructions Format:** The code returns a list of tuples for the instructions, but the instructions should be formatted as strings in the format specified in the problem statement. The code should modify the instructions to match the required format.

7. **Missing Function Call:** The code doesn't include a function call to execute the program. It should include the function call and print the output as required.

Overall, the code needs to be fixed to handle these bugs and issues in order to produce the correct output.
