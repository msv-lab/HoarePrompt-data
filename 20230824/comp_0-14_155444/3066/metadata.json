          "feedback": "## REVIEW\n\nLooking at the code, there are several bugs and issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Incorrect Output Handling:** The code returns the string \"IMPOSSIBLE\" if there are multiple instances of a color, but it should return a list of instructions that would result in the tape art if it is possible. The code should handle this case correctly and return the correct set of instructions.\n\n2. **Counting Color Instances:** The code correctly counts the number of instances of each color, but it doesn't check for a special case: if there are more color instances than the length of the plank. In this case, it is impossible to create tape art with only one piece of each color, so the code should return \"IMPOSSIBLE\". This case is not currently handled in the code.\n\n3. **Loop Iteration Issue:** The loop that creates the instructions starts from 0 instead of 1. This causes the first piece of tape to be missed in the instructions. The loop should start from 1 to include the first piece of tape.\n\n4. **Current Color Initialization:** The variable `current_color` is initialized as 0, but color values start from 1. This causes the first piece of tape to have a color of 0 instead of the actual color. The variable should be initialized as `None` to avoid this issue.\n\n5. **Loop Iteration Range:** The loop that creates the instructions should iterate until `n-1` instead of `n` to avoid out of range errors when accessing `colors[i]` in the last iteration.\n\n6. **Returning Instructions Format:** The code returns a list of tuples for the instructions, but the instructions should be formatted as strings in the format specified in the problem statement. The code should modify the instructions to match the required format.\n\n7. **Missing Function Call:** The code doesn't include a function call to execute the program. It should include the function call and print the output as required.\n\nOverall, the code needs to be fixed to handle these bugs and issues in order to produce the correct output.",
