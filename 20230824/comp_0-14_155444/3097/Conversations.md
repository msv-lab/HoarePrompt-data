I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Anica is having peculiar dream. She is dreaming about an infinite board. On that board, an infinite table consisting of infinite rows and infinite columns containing infinite numbers is drawn. Interestingly, each number in the table appears a finite number of times.

The table is of exceptionally regular shape and its values meet the requirements of a simple recursive relation. The first cell of each row contains the ordinal number of that row. $A$ value of a cell that is not in the first column can be calculated by adding up the number in the cell to the left of it and that same number, only written in reverse (in decimal representation).

Formally, if $A(i, j)$ denotes the value in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column, it holds:
 - $A(i, 1) = i$
 - $A(i, j) = A(i, j - 1) + \mathrm{rev} (A(i, j - 1))$1, for each $j > 1$

Anica hasn’t shown too much interest in the board and obliviously passed by it. Behind the board, she noticed a lamp that immediately caught her attention. Anica also caught the lamp’s attention, so the friendly ghost Božo came out of it.

“Anica! If you answer correctly to my $Q$ queries, you will win a package of Dorina wafer or Domaćica cookies, based on your own choice! $I$ wouldn’t want to impose my stance, but in my personal opinion, the Dorina wafer cookies are better. Each query will consist of two integers $A$ and $B$. You must answer how many appearances of numbers from the interval $[A, B]$ there are on the board.”

Unfortunately, Anica couldn’t give an answer to the queries and woke up.

“Ah, I didn’t win the Dorina cookies, but at least I have a task for COCI”, she thought and went along with her business.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains the integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$), the number of queries. Each of the following $Q$ lines contains two integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{10}$) that represent the interval from the query.

-----Output-----
The $i$-th line of output must contain a single integer—the answer to the $i$-th query.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
2
1 10
5 8
Sample Output 1:
18

Sample Input 2:

### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3

121 121
89 98
" the output was "220
23
10
" but the expected output was "265
25
10
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are a few bugs in the code:

1. In the `count_appearances` function, the condition `if next_value > B: break` is incorrect. It should be `if next_value > B or next_value < A: break`. This is because once the value becomes greater than `B`, it will never be in the range `[A, B]`.

2. In the outer `while` loop of the `count_appearances` function, the condition `if reverse(row) > B: break` is incorrect. It should be `if reverse(row) >= B: break`. This is because if the reverse of `row` is greater than or equal to `B`, no more values from that row will be within the range `[A, B]`.

3. The `queries` list is unnecessary. We can directly process each query in the `for` loop without storing them.

### BUGS
1. In line 16, change `if A <= value <= B:` to `if A <= value and value <= B:`
2. In line 18, change `if next_value > B:` to `if next_value > B or next_value < A:`
3. In line 21, change `if reverse(row) > B:` to `if reverse(row) >= B:`
