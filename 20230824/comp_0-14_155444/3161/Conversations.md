I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Josip is a strange painter. He wants to paint a picture consisting of $N \times N$ pixels, where $N$ is a power of two ($1, 2, 4, 8, 16$ etc.). Each pixel will be either black or white. Josip already has an idea of how each pixel will be coloured.

This would be no problem if Josip’s painting process wasn’t strange. He uses the following recursive process:
 - If the picture is a single pixel, he colours it the way he intended.
 - Otherwise, split the square into four smaller squares and then:
 - Select one of the four squares and colour it white.
 - Select one of the three remaining squares and colour it black.
 - Consider the two remaining squares as new paintings and use the same three-step process on them.

Soon he noticed that it was not possible to convert all his visions to paintings with this process. Your task is to write a program that will paint a picture that differs as little as possible from the desired picture. The difference between two pictures is the number of pairs of pixels in corresponding positions that differ in colour.

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 512$), the size of the picture Josip would like to paint. $N$ will be a power of $2$. Each of the following $N$ lines contains $N$ digits $0$ or $1$, white and black squares in the target picture.

-----Output-----
On the first line, output the smallest possible difference that can be achieved. On the next $N$ lines, output a picture that can be painted with Josip’s process and achieves the smallest difference. The picture should be in the same format as in the input.

Note: The second part of the output (the picture) may not be unique. Any correct output will be accepted.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
4
0001
0001
0011
1110
Sample Output 1:
1
0001
0001
0011
1111

Sample Input 2:
4
1111
1111
1111
1111
Sample Output 2:
6
0011
0011
0111
1101
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided does not return the correct output for the given input. The bugs occur in the functions `count_differences` and `paint_picture`.

**1. Bug in count_differences():**
The purpose of this function is to count the number of differences between the target picture and the painted picture. However, the implementation is incorrect. The function compares each pixel in the picture with the pixel at index (0, 0), rather than comparing it with the corresponding pixel in the target picture. This results in an incorrect count of differences.

**2. Bug in paint_picture():**
The purpose of this function is to create a painted picture that minimizes the difference with the target picture. However, the implementation is incomplete and does not perform the necessary steps of Josip's painting process.

**3. Inconsistent data types:**
The input is read as a list of strings representing the picture, but the picture is stored as a list of lists of integers in the `paint_picture` function. This inconsistency should be addressed for the code to work correctly.

**4. Incorrect output format:**
The output is printed as a list of lists, but the expected format is a list of strings. The code should be modified to ensure that the output is in the correct format.

Overall, the code needs to be revised and corrected to produce the expected output.
