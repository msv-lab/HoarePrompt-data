I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### Requirement
You will NOT SUGGEST SOLUTION, because the user wants to fix the bugs themselves.

print(ways)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "10 1 2
" the output was "282041

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "10 1 2
" the output was "282041
" but the expected output was "45
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. The factorials are not being correctly calculated. The code initializes the `fact` list with the value `[1]`, which is correct since 0! = 1. However, the loop to calculate the factorials starts from `1` instead of starting from `2`. This means that the factorials for the values `1, 2, 3, ..., N` are not being calculated properly.

2. The calculation of `ways` is incorrect. The formula used to calculate the number of ways is incorrect. The correct formula should be `fact[N] / (fact[K] * fact[N-K])`. However, the code tries to calculate the modular inverse of `fact[K] * fact[N-K]` using the Fermat's Little Theorem and `pow`, but the calculation is incorrect.

3. The code uses unnecessary modulo operations. The code unnecessarily uses modulo operations with `(10**6 + 7)` multiple times, which can slow down the code. It would be more efficient to calculate `(10**6 + 7)` once and store it in a variable.

Now let's analyze the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality:

1. The incorrect calculation of factorials would result in an incorrect calculation of `fact[N]`, which is used in the calculation of `ways`. This means that the final result would be incorrect.

2. The incorrect calculation of `ways` would result in an incorrect number of ways being calculated. This means that the final result would be incorrect.

3. The unnecessary modulo operations do not have a direct impact on the correctness of the final result, but they can slow down the code unnecessarily.

Overall, the bugs in the code result in incorrect calculations of the number of ways, leading to incorrect final results.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Fix the calculation of factorials by starting the loop from `2` instead of `1`.

2. Update the calculation of `ways` using the corrected formula `fact[N] // (fact[K] * fact[N-K])`.

3. Remove the unnecessary modulo operations.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Read input
N, M, K = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize factorials
fact = [1]
for i in range(2, N+1):
    fact.append((fact[-1] * i))

# Calculate the number of ways
ways = fact[N] // (fact[K] * fact[N-K])

print(ways % (10**6 + 7))
```

This code correctly calculates the factorials and the number of ways and outputs the result modulo `10**6 + 7`.
