The count_syllables function does not correctly handle the exceptions for silent 'e' at the end of a word and 'end' followed by 'es' at the end of a word. The conditions for these exceptions are incorrect.\n\n2. The haiku_check function does not correctly split the input line into a haiku. It does not consider the restriction that the first and third lines should contain 5 syllables each and the second line should contain 7 syllables.\n\n3. The haiku_check function does not correctly handle the case when there are less than 3 lines in the haiku. It should return the original line if it cannot form a haiku with 3 lines.\n\n4. The haiku_check function does not join the line_words list with a space when constructing the haiku lines.\n\nNow let's go through the code step by step and discuss these bugs in more detail.",
