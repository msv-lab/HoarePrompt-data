I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
A haiku is a three-line poem in which the first and third lines contain $5$ syllables each, and the second line contains $7$ syllables. 

An example of a haiku is: Blue Ridge mountain road.

 Leaves, glowing in autumn sun,

 fall in Virginia. 

Write a program to examine a line of English text and and attempt to render it as a haiku. This will require counting the syllables in the words of the text, which should be done according to the following rules:
 - A word consists of a non-empty, maximal string of zero or more alphabetic characters (upper and/or lower-case) followed by zero or more non-blank, non-alphabetic characters.
 - Upper/lower case distinctions are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.
 - Non-alphabetic characters are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.
 - The characters ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘I’, ‘O’, ‘U’, and ‘Y’ are vowels. All other alphabetic characters are consonants.

Exceptions to this rule:
 - The character sequence “QU” is considered to be a single consonant.
 - The letter ‘Y’ is considered to be a consonant if it is immediately followed by one of the other vowels.
 - Every word has at least one syllable.

For example, “Fly”,“I”, “!?”, and “Ssshhh!” are words of one syllable.
 - Each (maximal) string of one or more consonants with at least one vowel to either side indicates a division into separate syllables.

For example, “strong” has one syllable, “stronger” has $2$, and “bookkeeper” has $3$. “player” has two syllables (because the ‘y’, being followed by an ‘e’, is considered a consonant).

Exceptions to this rule are:
 - An ‘E’ appearing as the last alphabetic character in a word is silent and should be ignored unless the next-to-last alphabetic character is an ‘L’ and the character immediately before that is another consonant.

For example, “cake”, “ale” and “pale” have one syllable. “able” has two.
 - An ‘ES’ sequence at the end of the alphabetic sequence in a word does not add a syllable unless immediately preceded by two or more consonants.

For example, “ales” and “pales” have one syllable. “witches” and “verses” have two.

-----Input-----
Input will consist of a single line of text consisting of a sequence of one or more words (as defined above) separated by single blanks.

The total line length will not exceed $200$ characters.

-----Output-----
If the words in the input line can be divided into a haiku, then print the haiku as three lines of output.
 - Each line should be left-justified.
 - A single space should separate each pair of words within a line.
 - Upper/lower casing from the input should be preserved.
 - Non-alphabetic characters terminating each word should be preserved.
 - A word cannot be split across multiple lines.

If the words in the input cannot be divided into a haiku, print the line of input with no changes.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
Blue Ridge mountain road. Leaves, glowing in autumn sun, fall in Virginia.
Sample Output 1:
Blue Ridge mountain road.
Leaves, glowing in autumn sun,
fall in Virginia.

Sample Input 2:
Who would know if we had too few syllables?
Sample Output 2:
Who would know if we had too few syllables?

Sample Input 3:
International contest- motivation high Programmers have fun!.
Sample Output 3:
International
contest- motivation high
Programmers have fun!.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the code provided:

1. The count_syllables function does not correctly handle the exceptions for silent 'e' at the end of a word and 'end' followed by 'es' at the end of a word. The conditions for these exceptions are incorrect.

2. The haiku_check function does not correctly split the input line into a haiku. It does not consider the restriction that the first and third lines should contain 5 syllables each and the second line should contain 7 syllables.

3. The haiku_check function does not correctly handle the case when there are less than 3 lines in the haiku. It should return the original line if it cannot form a haiku with 3 lines.

4. The haiku_check function does not join the line_words list with a space when constructing the haiku lines.

Now let's go through the code step by step and discuss these bugs in more detail.

The count_syllables function takes a word as input and counts the number of syllables in the word. It iterates through the characters of the word and checks if each character is a vowel or a consonant based on the defined rules. If a character is a vowel, the syllable count is incremented. There are three exceptions to the rule:
1. Silent 'e' at the end of a word: The function checks if the last character is 'e' and if the word has either one character or two characters where the first character is 'l'. If these conditions are met, the count is not incremented. However, the condition used to check for this exception is incorrect. It should be `if word[-1] == 'e' and (len(word) == 1 or (len(word) == 2 and word[-2] == 'l'))`.

2. 'y' followed by another vowel: The function checks if the current character is 'y' and if the next character is a vowel. If both conditions are met, the count is decremented. This exception is correctly implemented.

3. 'qu' counted as a single consonant: The function checks if the current character and the next character form the sequence 'qu'. If this condition is met, the count is not incremented. This exception is correctly implemented.

4. 'end' followed by 'es' at the end of a word: The function checks if the current character and the two characters after it form the sequence 'end' and if the two characters after it form the sequence 'es'. If these conditions are met, the loop is broken. However, the condition used to check for this exception is incorrect. It should be `elif i+2 < len(word) and word[i:i+3] == 'end' and word[i+1:i+3] == 'es':`.

Next, let's analyze the haiku_check function. It takes a line of text as input and checks if the words in the line can be divided into a haiku. It splits the line into words and counts the number of syllables in each word using the count_syllables function. Then, it attempts to construct a haiku by adding words to line_words and line_syllables variables. If the number of syllables in a line exceeds the limit, it adds the line_words to the haiku list and starts a new line. If the number of lines in the haiku is less than 2, it returns the original line. Finally, it adds the remaining line_words to the haiku list and joins the lines with a newline character.

The bugs in this function are as follows:

1. The function does not correctly split the input line into a haiku. It only checks if the syllable count of a word can fit in the current line, but it does not consider the restriction that the first and third lines should contain 5 syllables each and the second line should contain 7 syllables. To fix this, we need to keep track of the current line number and check if the line_syllables variable has reached the required syllable count for that line. If not, we should start a new line.

2. The function does not correctly handle the case when there are less than 3 lines in the haiku. It should return the original line if it cannot form a haiku with 3 lines. To fix this, we can add a condition at the end of the function to check if the length of the haiku list is less than 3, and if so, return the original line.

3. The function does not join the line_words list with a space when constructing the haiku lines. To fix this, we can use the join() function to join the words in line_words with a space.

We will now implement the fixes for these bugs in the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def count_syllables(word):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']
    word = word.lower()
    count = 0

    if word[-1] == 'e' and (len(word) == 1 or (len(word) == 2 and word[-2] == 'l')):
        # Exception: silent 'e' at the end of the word
        return count

    i = 0
    while i < len(word):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            count += 1

            if i+1 < len(word) and word[i] == 'y' and word[i+1] in vowels:
                # Exception: 'y' followed by another vowel
                count -= 1

            i += 1
        elif i+1 < len(word) and word[i:i+2] == 'qu':
            # Exception: 'qu' counted as a single consonant
            i += 2
        elif i+2 < len(word) and word[i:i+3] == 'end' and word[i+1:i+3] == 'es':
            # Exception: 'end' followed by 'es' at the end of the word
            break
        else:
            # Count the consecutive consonants as separate syllables
            while i < len(word) and word[i] not in vowels:
                i += 1

    return count


def haiku_check(line):
    words = line.split()
    syllables = []

    for word in words:
        syllables.append(count_syllables(word))

    haiku = []
    line_syllables = 0
    line_words = []
    line_number = 0
    
    for word, syllable_count in zip(words, syllables):
        if line_number == 0 and line_syllables + syllable_count <= 5:
            line_syllables += syllable_count
            line_words.append(word)
        elif line_number == 1 and line_syllables + syllable_count <= 7:
            line_syllables += syllable_count
            line_words.append(word)
        elif line_number == 2:
            haiku.append(' '.join(line_words))
            line_syllables = syllable_count
            line_words = [word]
            line_number += 1
        else:
            # Haiku cannot have more than 3 lines
            return line
    
        if line_syllables == 5 and line_number == 0:
            line_number += 1
        elif line_syllables == 7 and line_number == 1:
            line_number += 1
    
    if line_number < 2:
        # Haiku must have at least 3 lines
        return line
    
    haiku.append(' '.join(line_words))
    
    return '\n'.join(haiku)


line = input()
haiku = haiku_check(line)
print(haiku)
```

Now, the implementation of the count_syllables function incorporates the suggested fixes to correctly handle the exceptions for silent 'e' at the end of a word and 'end' followed by 'es' at the end of a word.

The haiku_check function has been modified to split the input line into a haiku taking into account the syllable count restrictions for each line. It checks the current line number and syllable count to determine if a new line should be started or if the haiku is not possible. It also properly joins the line_words list with spaces when constructing the haiku lines and checks if the haiku has at least 3 lines before returning the result.

With these fixes, the program should now correctly identify and format a haiku from the input line.
