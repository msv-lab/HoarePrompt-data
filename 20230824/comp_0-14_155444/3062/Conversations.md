I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
You are programming an autonomous rocket powered hovercraft. The vehicle can travel very, very fast, but turning is difficult. Since it’s hovering, it turns by firing directional thrusters, which will turn the vehicle whether it is moving forward or is stationary.

The salt flats on which you’re testing have been mapped with a 2D Cartesian grid. The hovercraft starts at location $(00)$ on this grid, facing in the positive $X$ direction. Your job is to get the vehicle to another location $(xy)$ on the flats.

The hovercraft has a fixed ground speed $v$ miles per second and a fixed rate of rotation $w$ radians per second. Due to the power of the rockets both for acceleration and deceleration, it can attain its maximum speed virtually instantaneously, and come to a stop from maximum speed just as quickly. Likewise, it can begin rotating at its fixed rate instantaneously, and stop just as quickly. It can rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

You must figure out the minimum amount of time to get the vehicle to its target. The program which controls the vehicle can start forward motion, stop forward motion, start rotating, and stop rotating, each exactly once. Note that starting/stopping forward movement can be independent of starting/stopping rotation.

-----Input-----
Each test case will consist of exactly two lines.

The first line will contain two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ ($-1000\! \le \! x,y\! \le \! 1000, (xy){\neq }(00)$), which indicate the location on the grid mapped onto the flats that you are trying to reach, in units of miles.

The second line of input will contain two space-separated real numbers with exactly two decimal places: $v$ ($0.01\! \le \! v\! \le \! 10.00$) and $w$ ($0.01\! \le \! w\! \le \! 10.00$), where $v$ is the fixed speed of travel in miles per second, and $w$ is the fixed rate of rotation in either direction in radians per second.

-----Output-----
Output a single real number, which is the minimum amount of time (in seconds) it would take get the hovercraft from $(00)$ to $(xy)$ subject to the constraints. Your answer will be accepted if it is within an absolute error of $10^{-3}$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
20 0
1.00 0.10
Sample Output 1:
20.00000000

Sample Input 2:
-10 10
10.00 1.00
Sample Output 2:
3.14159265

Sample Input 3:
0 20
1.00 0.10
Sample Output 3:
28.26445910
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code is designed to calculate the minimum amount of time it takes for the hovercraft to reach a target location on a 2D grid. There are two main components to consider: straight movement and rotation.

- Straight Movement: The code correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between the starting point and target location. It then calculates the time it takes to travel straight at a fixed speed using the equation `distance / v`. However, there are no checks to ensure that the hovercraft is actually facing the target location before moving straight. This means that the time calculated for straight movement may not be accurate if the hovercraft is not facing directly towards the target.

- Rotation: The code correctly calculates the angle between the starting point and target location using `math.atan2(y, x)`. It then calculates the time it takes to rotate at a fixed rate using the equation `angle / w`. However, there are no checks to ensure that the hovercraft is actually moving straight before starting to rotate. This means that the time calculated for rotation may not be accurate if the hovercraft is not moving straight towards the target.

- Total Time: The code calculates the total time by summing the time for straight movement and the time for rotation. However, since there are no checks for the hovercraft's orientation before straight movement and rotation, the total time calculated may not be accurate.

### BUGS

1. No checks for hovercraft's orientation before straight movement or rotation
2. Incorrect calculation of total time due to missing checks for hovercraft's orientation

### CORRECTED CODE

The following is the corrected code with fixes for the identified issues:

```python
import math

x, y = map(int, input().split())
v, w = map(float, input().split())

# calculate the Euclidean distance
distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# calculate the angle to turn
angle = math.atan2(y, x)

# calculate the time to rotate
rotate_time = angle / w

# calculate the time to travel straight
if w == 0 or angle == 0:
    straight_time = distance / v
else:
    straight_time = abs(angle) / w + distance / v

# calculate the total time
total_time = straight_time + rotate_time

# print the result with 8 decimal places
print("{:.8f}".format(total_time))
```

### REVISED CODE EXPLANATION

1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the starting point and the target location using the formula `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`.

2. Calculate the angle to turn using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This gives the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the starting point with the target location.

3. Calculate the time it takes to rotate using the formula `angle / w`.

4. Check if the hovercraft needs to rotate. If `w` is zero or `angle` is zero, it means the hovercraft is already facing the target location. In this case, the time to rotate is zero. Otherwise, the time to rotate is `abs(angle) / w`, taking into account the direction of rotation.

5. Check if the hovercraft needs to move straight. If the hovercraft does not need to rotate (`w` is zero) or the angle to turn is zero, it means the hovercraft is already facing the target location and can move straight. In this case, the time to travel straight is `distance / v`. Otherwise, the hovercraft needs to rotate first and then move straight. In this case, the time to travel straight is `abs(angle) / w + distance / v`, considering the time it takes to rotate.

6. Calculate the total time by summing the time to rotate and the time to travel straight.

7. Print the total time with 8 decimal places using the format string `"{:.8f}"`.
