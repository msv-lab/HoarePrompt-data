I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Theta has been learning about powers of $2$ in school. She notices that some numbers when written out contain powers of $2$ in their digit representation: for instance, $12560$ contains $256$ which is a power of $2$. She has been wondering how many such numbers there are.

Can you write a program that counts how many numbers contain a given power of $2$?

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single line with two integers $n$ and $e$ ($0 \le n \le 9 \cdot 10^{18}, 0 \le e \le 62$).

-----Output-----
Output a single integer that is equal to the number of distinct integers $k$ ($0 \le k \le n$) whose decimal representation contains the digits of $2^e$ as a substring.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
1000000 1
Sample Output 1:
468559

Sample Input 2:
1000000 5
Sample Output 2:
49401

Sample Input 3:
1000000 16
Sample Output 3:
20

Sample Input 4:
9000000000000000000 62
Sample Output 4:
1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
n, e = map(int, input().split())

count = 0

for num in range(n+1):
    if str(2**e) in str(num):
        count += 1

print(count)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "9000000000000000000 62
" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "1

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "9000000000000000000 62
" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Review
The code seems to have a performance issue. It produces a "Time Limit Exceeds" error for larger inputs. Additionally, it doesn't count the number of distinct integers correctly.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code and the issues it has:

1. The code takes two integers `n` and `e` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `count` to 0.
3. It loops through numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
4. For each number, it checks if the string representation of `2**e` (the `e`th power of 2) is in the string representation of the current number.
5. If it is, it increments the `count` variable.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

### Issues:
1. Performance: The code iterates through numbers from 0 to `n` and converts each number to a string to check if `2**e` is a substring. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and can be very slow for large values of `n`.
2. Counting the number of distinct integers: The code checks if the string representation of `2**e` is a substring of each number. However, this can result in counting the same number multiple times if it contains multiple occurrences of `2**e`. For example, for `n = 12560` and `e = 8`, the code will count the number 12560 twice (as it has two occurrences of 256 in its digits).
3. Comparison issue: The code uses `in` keyword to check if `2**e` is a substring of the number's digits. This can lead to incorrect results if the digits of `2**e` appear in a different order in the number. For example, for `n = 12560` and `e = 8`, the code will not count the number 12560 as it checks for the exact substring match and the digits of `2**e` (256) are not in the same order.

Considering the issues mentioned above, the code needs revision and improvement to correctly count the number of distinct integers that contain the digits of `2**e` as a substring.

    power_length = len(power_digits)
    
    for num in range(n + 1):
        num_digits = str(num)
        num_length = len(num_digits)
        
        if num_length < power_length:
            continue
        
        for i in range(num_length - power_length + 1):
            if num_digits[i:i + power_length] == power_digits:
                count += 1
