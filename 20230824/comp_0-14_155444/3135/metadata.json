          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n\nThere are a few bugs in the code provided:\n\n1. The list `binary_list` is not correctly constructed from the input string `n`. The code uses `int(d)` to convert each digit `d` of `n` to an integer, but this will not work correctly for values of `d` greater than 1. Additionally, the bits in `n` are stored in reversed order, so the resulting list will not correspond to the bits in the correct order.\n\n2. The logic for setting the signed binary representation (`signed_binary`) is incorrect. The code incorrectly assumes that the previous digit will always be 1 if the current digit is 1, which is not necessarily true. This logic results in incorrect values being set for the previous digit when the current digit is 1.\n\n3. The conversion of `signed_binary` to a string is not correct. The code uses `'+' if d == 1 else '-' if d == -1 else '0'` to convert each element `d` of `signed_binary` to the corresponding character. However, the condition for `d == -1` will never be `True` because the code incorrectly sets the signed binary representation to 2 instead of -1 when the current digit is 2.\n\n4. The input value `n` is not read correctly. The code uses `input()` to read the input, but this will read the entire line as a single string. The code is expecting a binary number, so it should read the input as an integer and then convert it to a binary string.\n\n### BUGS\n\n1. The list `binary_list` is not correctly constructed from the input string `n`.

The incorrect construction of `binary_list` will result in incorrect values being used throughout the code, leading to incorrect calculations.\n\n2. The incorrect logic for setting `signed_binary` will result in incorrect values being set for the previous digits, leading to incorrect signed binary representations.\n\n3. The incorrect conversion of `signed_binary` to a string will result in incorrect output, with the wrong characters being used for the signed binary representation.\n\n4. The incorrect reading of the input value `n` will result in incorrect calculations and output, as the code is not correctly processing the binary number.",
