I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
 “Increase my killing power, eh?” – Homer Simpson

You are probably familiar with the binary representation of integers, i.e. writing a nonnegative integer $n$ as $\sum _{i=0}^k a_ i \cdot 2^i$, where each $a_ i$ is either $0$ or $1$. In this problem, we consider a so called signed binary representation, in which we still write $n$ as $\sum _{i=0}^{k} a_ i \cdot 2^i$, but allow $a_ i$ to take on the values $-1$, $0$ and $1$. For instance, $n=13$ can be represented as\[ (1, 0, 0, -1, -1) = 2^4 - 2^1 - 2^0. \]

The binary representation of a number is unique, but obviously, the signed binary representation is not. In certain applications (e.g. in cryptography), one seeks to write a number $n$ in signed binary representation with as few non-zero digits as possible. For example, we consider the representation $(1, 0, 0, -1)$ to be a better representation of $n = 7$ than $(1, 1, 1)$. Your task is to write a program which will find such a minimal representation.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single line containing a positive integer $n < 2^{100000}$ written in binary, without leading zeros.

-----Output-----
For each line of input, output one line containing the signed binary representation of $n$ that has the minimal number of non-zero digits, using the characters ‘-’ for $-1$, ‘0’ for $0$ and ‘+’ for $+1$. The number should be written without leading zeros. If there are several minimal representations, output the one that is lexicographically smallest (by the ASCII ordering, in which $‘\texttt{+}‘ < ‘\texttt{-}‘ < ‘\texttt{0}‘$).

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
10000
Sample Output 1:
+0000

Sample Input 2:
1111
Sample Output 2:
+000-
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1111

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code provided:

1. The list `binary_list` is not correctly constructed from the input string `n`. The code uses `int(d)` to convert each digit `d` of `n` to an integer, but this will not work correctly for values of `d` greater than 1. Additionally, the bits in `n` are stored in reversed order, so the resulting list will not correspond to the bits in the correct order.

2. The logic for setting the signed binary representation (`signed_binary`) is incorrect. The code incorrectly assumes that the previous digit will always be 1 if the current digit is 1, which is not necessarily true. This logic results in incorrect values being set for the previous digit when the current digit is 1.

3. The conversion of `signed_binary` to a string is not correct. The code uses `'+' if d == 1 else '-' if d == -1 else '0'` to convert each element `d` of `signed_binary` to the corresponding character. However, the condition for `d == -1` will never be `True` because the code incorrectly sets the signed binary representation to 2 instead of -1 when the current digit is 2.

4. The input value `n` is not read correctly. The code uses `input()` to read the input, but this will read the entire line as a single string. The code is expecting a binary number, so it should read the input as an integer and then convert it to a binary string.

### BUGS

1. The list `binary_list` is not correctly constructed from the input string `n`. The code uses `int(d)` to convert each digit `d` of `n` to an integer, but this will not work correctly for values of `d` greater than 1. The bits in `n` are stored in reversed order.

2. The logic for setting the signed binary representation (`signed_binary`) is incorrect. The code incorrectly assumes that the previous digit will always be 1 if the current digit is 1, resulting in incorrect values being set for the previous digit when the current digit is 1.

3. The conversion of `signed_binary` to a string is not correct. The code uses `'+' if d == 1 else '-' if d == -1 else '0'` to convert each element `d` of `signed_binary` to the corresponding character. However, the condition for `d == -1` will never be `True` because the code incorrectly sets the signed binary representation to 2 instead of -1 when the current digit is 2.

4. The input value `n` is not read correctly. The code uses `input()` to read the input, but this will read the entire line as a single string. The code is expecting a binary number, so it should read the input as an integer and then convert it to a binary string.

### IMPACT

1. The incorrect construction of `binary_list` will result in incorrect values being used throughout the code, leading to incorrect calculations.

2. The incorrect logic for setting `signed_binary` will result in incorrect values being set for the previous digits, leading to incorrect signed binary representations.

3. The incorrect conversion of `signed_binary` to a string will result in incorrect output, with the wrong characters being used for the signed binary representation.

4. The incorrect reading of the input value `n` will result in incorrect calculations and output, as the code is not correctly processing the binary number.

The updated code should address the bugs mentioned in the analysis. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def minimal_signed_binary(n):
    # Convert the binary string to a list of integers
    binary_list = [int(d) for d in str(n)][::-1]
    
    # Initialize the signed binary representation with all zeros
    signed_binary = [0] * len(binary_list)
    
    # Iterate through the binary list
    for i in range(len(binary_list)):
        # If the current digit is 1, set the signed binary representation to +1
        if binary_list[i] == 1:
            signed_binary[i] = 1
            # Check if the previous digit is also 1
            if i > 0 and binary_list[i-1] == 1:
                # If so, set the previous digit to 0 since it can be represented as -1
                signed_binary[i-1] = 0
        
        # If the current digit is 0, set the signed binary representation to 0
        elif binary_list[i] == 0:
            signed_binary[i] = 0
        
        # If the current digit is 2, set the signed binary representation to -1
        elif binary_list[i] == 2:
            signed_binary[i] = -1
            # Check if the previous digit is also 1
            if i > 0 and binary_list[i-1] == 1:
                # If so, set the previous digit to 0 since it can be represented as -1
                signed_binary[i-1] = 0
    
    # Convert the signed binary representation to a string
    signed_binary_str = ''.join(['+' if d == 1 else '-' if d == -1 else '0' for d in signed_binary[::-1]])
    
    return signed_binary_str

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Generate the minimal signed binary representation
minimal_rep = minimal_signed_binary(bin(n)[2:])

# Print the result
print(minimal_rep)
```

In this code, the input value `n` is read as an integer. Then, `bin(n)[2:]` is used to convert `n` to its binary representation as a string, excluding the `0b` prefix. This ensures that the binary representation is correctly processed.

The `binary_list` is constructed by reversing the bits of the binary representation using `[::-1]`. This ensures that the bits are in the correct order.

The logic for setting the signed binary representation (`signed_binary`) has been fixed. The code now correctly checks the previous digit when the current digit is 1 or 2 and sets the corresponding value for the previous digit.

The conversion of `signed_binary` to a string has been corrected. The code now correctly uses `'-'` to represent -1, `'+'` to represent 1, and `'0'` to represent 0.

Finally, the output is printed as expected.

Note: The code assumes that the input value `n` is a positive integer. If negative integers are allowed, additional checks and handling would be needed.
