I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R = map(int, input().split())

# Find the smallest possible value for k' and l'
k_prime = max(0, (L - b1) // a1)
l_prime = max(0, (L - b2) // a2)

# Find the largest possible value for k' and l'
k_double_prime = (R - b1) // a1
l_double_prime = (R - b2) // a2

# Calculate the number of integers x
num_x = max(0, min(k_double_prime, l_double_prime) - max(k_prime, l_prime) + 1)

print(num_x)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 0 3 3 5 21
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "3
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#

### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R = map(int, input().split())

# Find the smallest possible value for k' and l'
k_prime = max(0, (L - b1) // a1)

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 0 3 3 5 21
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUG 1: Incorrect calculation of k_prime and l_prime

In the code, the calculation for `k_prime` and `l_prime` is incorrect. This leads to incorrect values for the starting points of the arithmetic progressions.

```
k_prime = max(0, (L - b1) // a1)
l_prime = max(0, (L - b2) // a2)
```

The correct calculation should be:

```
k_prime = max(0, (L - b1 + a1 - 1) // a1)
l_prime = max(0, (L - b2 + a2 - 1) // a2)
```

By adding `(a - 1)` to the numerator, we ensure that the division rounds up to the nearest integer. This is necessary to ensure that the starting point of the arithmetic progression is at least `L`.

### BUG 2: Incorrect calculation of k_double_prime and l_double_prime

Similarly, the calculation for `k_double_prime` and `l_double_prime` is incorrect. This leads to incorrect values for the ending points of the arithmetic progressions.

```
k_double_prime = (R - b1) // a1
l_double_prime = (R - b2) // a2
```

The correct calculation should be:

```
k_double_prime = (R - b1) // a1
l_double_prime = (R - b2) // a2
```

There is no need to adjust the calculation for the ending points of the arithmetic progressions.

### BUG 3: Incorrect calculation of num_x

The calculation for `num_x` is also incorrect. This leads to an incorrect count of the number of integers `x` that satisfy the given conditions.

```
num_x = max(0, min(k_double_prime, l_double_prime) - max(k_prime, l_prime) + 1)
```

The correct calculation should be:

```
num_x = max(0, min(k_double_prime, l_double_prime) - max(k_prime, l_prime) + 1)
```

There is no need to adjust the calculation for `num_x`.

### Impact on functionality

These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. They lead to incorrect values for `num_x`, which represents the number of integers `x` that satisfy the given conditions. The program may provide incorrect results, as observed in the examples provided.

I apologize for the confusion. The code you provided is the incorrect code that needs to be fixed. Here's the corrected code after addressing the identified issues:

```python
a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R = map(int, input().split())

# Find the smallest possible value for k' and l'
k_prime = max(0, (L - b1 + a1 - 1) // a1)
l_prime = max(0, (L - b2 + a2 - 1) // a2)

# Find the largest possible value for k' and l'
k_double_prime = (R - b1) // a1
l_double_prime = (R - b2) // a2

# Calculate the number of integers x
num_x = max(0, min(k_double_prime, l_double_prime) - max(k_prime, l_prime) + 1)

print(num_x)
```

With these corrections, the code should now work as expected and provide the correct output for the given inputs.
