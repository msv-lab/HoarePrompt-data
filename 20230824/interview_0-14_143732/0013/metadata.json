          "feedback": "### CODE REVIEW\n\nThe code you provided seems to have a few bugs that are causing unexpected results. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs one by one.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the DFS function:\n\n```python\ndef dfs(course):\n    visited.add(course)\n\n    # Visit all the courses that this course depends on\n    for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:\n        if dependency not in visited:\n            dfs(dependency)\n    \n    # After visiting all dependencies, add this course to the course order\n    course_order.append(course)\n```\n\nThis function aims to perform a depth-first search to visit all the dependencies of a course and add them to the course order. While the implementation seems correct, we need to make sure we visit all the dependencies in the correct order.\n\nNext, let's examine the main logic of the code:\n\n```python\nfor main_course in reversed(main_courses):\n    if main_course not in visited:\n        dfs(main_course)\n\n# If the number of courses in the course order is less than k, there is no way to get the specialty\nif len(course_order) < k:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    # Print the minimum number of courses required and the order of courses to be passed\n    print(len(course_order))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, reversed(course_order))))\n```\n\nThe main logic starts by iterating over the main courses in reverse order and calling the `dfs` function for each main course. This is correct because we want to prioritize the main courses.\n\nAfter visiting all the courses, it checks if the number of courses in the order is less than k. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to get the specialty. Otherwise, it prints the length of the course order and the courses in reverse order.\n\nNow, let's discuss the bugs in the code:\n\n1. **Incorrect course order**: When adding courses to the `course_order` list, the code is appending the course in the wrong order. This is because the `course_order.append(course)` line is placed after the for loop that visits the dependencies. To fix this, we need to move the `course_order.append(course)` line inside the `dfs` function, but before the for loop.\n\n2. **Incomplete course dependencies**: In the `dfs` function, the line `for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:` is incorrect. It is trying to iterate over the dependencies, but the variable `course_dependencies[course]` is not a list of dependencies, but a single dependency. This is because the line that assigns the dependencies to `course_dependencies[i]` is incorrect. To fix this, we need to change `course_dependencies[i] = dependencies` to `course_dependencies[i] = [dependencies]`.\n\n3. **Missing course dependencies**: When initializing the `course_dependencies` dictionary, you are setting the initial value of each course as an empty list. However, this is incorrect because some courses may have no dependencies. To fix this, we can set the initial value of each course as an empty set instead of an empty list.\n\nWith these identified issues, let's update the code:\n\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nmain_courses = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncourse_dependencies = {}  # Store dependencies for each course\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    dependencies = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]\n    course_dependencies[i] = [dependencies]\n\ncourse_order = []  # Store the order of courses to be passed\nvisited = set()  # Keep track of visited courses\n\ndef dfs(course):\n    visited.add(course)\n    course_order.append(course)  # Add the course to the course order\n\n    # Visit all the courses that this course depends on\n    for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:\n        if dependency not in visited:\n            dfs(dependency)\n\n# Visit the main courses in reverse order\nfor main_course in reversed(main_courses):\n    if main_course not in visited:\n        dfs(main_course)\n\n# If the number of courses in the course order is less than k, there is no way to get the specialty\nif len(course_order) < k:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    # Print the minimum number of courses required and the order of courses to be passed\n    print(len(course_order))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, reversed(course_order))))\n```\n\nI hope this code review helps you in fixing the bugs in your code. Good luck!",
