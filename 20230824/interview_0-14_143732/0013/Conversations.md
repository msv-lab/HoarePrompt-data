I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Now you can take online courses in the Berland State University! Polycarp needs to pass k main online courses of his specialty to get a diploma. In total n courses are availiable for the passage.

The situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).

Help Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses). Write a program which prints the order of courses. 

Polycarp passes courses consistently, he starts the next course when he finishes the previous one. Each course can't be passed more than once. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

The second line contains k distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty. 

Then n lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the i-th of them corresponds to the course i. Each line starts from the integer t_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the number of courses on which the i-th depends. Then there follows the sequence of t_{i} distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of courses in random order, on which the i-th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of all values t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^5. 


-----Output-----

Print -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty. 

Otherwise, in the first line print the integer m — the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print m distinct integers — numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage. If there are several answers it is allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
5 3
0
0
0
2 2 1
1 4
1 5

Output
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
6
1 2 9 4 5 3 

Input
3 3
1 2 3
1 2
1 3
1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test firstly you can take courses number 1 and 2, after that you can take the course number 4, then you can take the course number 5, which is the main. After that you have to take only the course number 3, which is the last not passed main course.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### CODE REVIEW

The code you provided seems to have a few bugs that are causing unexpected results. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs one by one.

First, let's take a look at the DFS function:

```python
def dfs(course):
    visited.add(course)

    # Visit all the courses that this course depends on
    for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:
        if dependency not in visited:
            dfs(dependency)
    
    # After visiting all dependencies, add this course to the course order
    course_order.append(course)
```

This function aims to perform a depth-first search to visit all the dependencies of a course and add them to the course order. While the implementation seems correct, we need to make sure we visit all the dependencies in the correct order.

Next, let's examine the main logic of the code:

```python
for main_course in reversed(main_courses):
    if main_course not in visited:
        dfs(main_course)

# If the number of courses in the course order is less than k, there is no way to get the specialty
if len(course_order) < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    # Print the minimum number of courses required and the order of courses to be passed
    print(len(course_order))
    print(' '.join(map(str, reversed(course_order))))
```

The main logic starts by iterating over the main courses in reverse order and calling the `dfs` function for each main course. This is correct because we want to prioritize the main courses.

After visiting all the courses, it checks if the number of courses in the order is less than k. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to get the specialty. Otherwise, it prints the length of the course order and the courses in reverse order.

Now, let's discuss the bugs in the code:

1. **Incorrect course order**: When adding courses to the `course_order` list, the code is appending the course in the wrong order. This is because the `course_order.append(course)` line is placed after the for loop that visits the dependencies. To fix this, we need to move the `course_order.append(course)` line inside the `dfs` function, but before the for loop.

2. **Incomplete course dependencies**: In the `dfs` function, the line `for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:` is incorrect. It is trying to iterate over the dependencies, but the variable `course_dependencies[course]` is not a list of dependencies, but a single dependency. This is because the line that assigns the dependencies to `course_dependencies[i]` is incorrect. To fix this, we need to change `course_dependencies[i] = dependencies` to `course_dependencies[i] = [dependencies]`.

3. **Missing course dependencies**: When initializing the `course_dependencies` dictionary, you are setting the initial value of each course as an empty list. However, this is incorrect because some courses may have no dependencies. To fix this, we can set the initial value of each course as an empty set instead of an empty list.

With these identified issues, let's update the code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
main_courses = list(map(int, input().split()))

course_dependencies = {}  # Store dependencies for each course
for i in range(1, n+1):
    dependencies = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]
    course_dependencies[i] = [dependencies]

course_order = []  # Store the order of courses to be passed
visited = set()  # Keep track of visited courses

def dfs(course):
    visited.add(course)
    course_order.append(course)  # Add the course to the course order

    # Visit all the courses that this course depends on
    for dependency in course_dependencies[course]:
        if dependency not in visited:
            dfs(dependency)

# Visit the main courses in reverse order
for main_course in reversed(main_courses):
    if main_course not in visited:
        dfs(main_course)

# If the number of courses in the course order is less than k, there is no way to get the specialty
if len(course_order) < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    # Print the minimum number of courses required and the order of courses to be passed
    print(len(course_order))
    print(' '.join(map(str, reversed(course_order))))
```

I hope this code review helps you in fixing the bugs in your code. Good luck!
