I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at $i$-th step ($0$-indexed) you can:   either choose position $pos$ ($1 \le pos \le n$) and increase $v_{pos}$ by $k^i$;  or not choose any position and skip this step. 

You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array $v$ equal to the given array $a$ ($v_j = a_j$ for each $j$) after some step?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $2T$ lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 30$, $2 \le k \le 100$) — the size of arrays $v$ and $a$ and value $k$ used in the algorithm.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^{16}$) — the array you'd like to achieve.


-----Output-----

For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if you can achieve the array $a$ after some step or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
5
4 100
0 0 0 0
1 2
1
3 4
1 4 1
3 2
0 1 3
3 9
0 59049 810

Output
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES



-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the $0$-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.

In the second test case, you can add $k^0$ to $v_1$ and stop the algorithm.

In the third test case, you can't make two $1$ in the array $v$.

In the fifth test case, you can skip $9^0$ and $9^1$, then add $9^2$ and $9^3$ to $v_3$, skip $9^4$ and finally, add $9^5$ to $v_2$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

1 10
10000000000000000
" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "YES
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The given code has a few bugs that affect its functionality.

Here are the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality:

1. Bug: Incorrect input parsing
   - In the `can_achieve_array` function, when parsing the inputs `n` and `k`, the code is using `arr[i*2]` instead of `arr[i*2]`.
   - Impact: This leads to incorrect values for `n` and `k`, resulting in incorrect calculations later in the code.

2. Bug: Incorrect loop range in `can_achieve_array` function
   - The loop range in the `can_achieve_array` function is incorrect.
   - Impact: This causes an out of range error when trying to access `a[j]` since `a` has length `n`, but the loop range is from `0` to `n-1`.

3. Bug: Incorrect condition for breaking the loop in `can_achieve_array` function
   - The condition `if v[j] + k ** j > a[j]` is incorrect. It should be `if v[j] + k ** (j + 1) > a[j]` since the loop variable `j` starts from `0` but the power should be increased by `1` in each iteration.
   - Impact: This leads to incorrect calculations, causing the algorithm to add more than necessary to `v[j]`, resulting in incorrect values in the `v` array.

4. Bug: Incorrect comparison of `v` and `a`
   - The comparison `v == a` is incorrect. Since `v` and `a` are lists, they should be compared using the `all()` function to check if all elements are equal.
   - Impact: This causes incorrect results, leading to incorrect output.

5. Bug: Incorrect loop range when reading test cases
   - The loop range when reading the test cases is incorrect. It should be `range(2 * t)` instead of `range(t)`.
   - Impact: This causes the code to read fewer test cases than expected, leading to incorrect results.

6. Bug: Incorrect variable naming in the main code
   - In the main code, the variable `nk` should be renamed to `n` and `k` since it represents the values for `n` and `k`.
   - Impact: This does not affect the functionality of the code, but it can lead to confusion and make the code harder to understand.

7. Bug: Incorrect output format
   - The output format is incorrect. The program should print "YES" or "NO" (case insensitive), but the code currently prints "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" or nothing.
   - Impact: This leads to incorrect output and does not match the expected output format.

### BUG FIXES:

To fix the bugs and improve the functionality of the code, the following changes should be made:

1. Modify the line `n, k = arr[i*2]` to `n, k = arr[i*2]`

2. Modify the loop range in the `can_achieve_array` function to `range(n)`

3. Modify the condition in the `while` loop in the `can_achieve_array` function to `if v[j] + k ** (j + 1) > a[j]`

4. Modify the comparison `v == a` to `all(v[j] == a[j] for j in range(n))`

5. Modify the loop range when reading test cases to `range(2 * t)`

6. Rename the variable `nk` to `n` and `k` in the main code

7. Print "YES" or "NO" instead of "Error: Time Limit Exceeds"

### MODIFIED CODE:
```python
def can_achieve_array(t: int, arr: list):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = arr[i * 2]
        a = arr[i * 2 + 1]
        v = [0] * n
        for j in range(n):
            while v[j] < a[j]:
                if v[j] + k ** (j + 1) > a[j]:
                    break
                v[j] += k ** (j + 1)
        if all(v[j] == a[j] for j in range(n)):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    return results


# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Read the test cases
arr = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.append([n, k])
    arr.append(a)

# Call the function and print the results
results = can_achieve_array(t, arr)
for res in results:
    print(res)
```

With these modifications, the code should now work correctly and produce the expected output.
