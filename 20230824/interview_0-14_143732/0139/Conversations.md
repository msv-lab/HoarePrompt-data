I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The logic of determining if the graph is acyclic is incorrect.
2. The condition to check if a node has already been visited is incorrect.
3. The way the graph is constructed is incorrect.
4. The way the input is being parsed is incorrect.

### BUG 1: Incorrect logic for determining if the graph is acyclic

In the current code, the logic to determine if the graph is acyclic is incorrect. The code checks if a node has already been visited and returns `True`. However, this is not the correct condition to check for cycle detection. The code should check if the node is in the current path of the DFS traversal, and if so, there is a cycle.

### BUG 2: Incorrect condition to check if a node has already been visited

In the current code, the condition to check if a node has already been visited is incorrect. The code checks if `visited[node]` is `True`, and if so, returns `True`. However, the correct condition to check if a node has already been visited is `visited[node] == 1`, as the `visited` list is initialized with `[False] * (n+1)`. Additionally, the condition for returning `True` should be within the inner `while` loop, not outside of it.

### BUG 3: Incorrect construction of the graph

In the current code, the graph is constructed incorrectly. The variable `graph` is initialized as a list of empty lists with a size of `n+1`. However, the correct size for the graph should be `n`, as the node indices range from 1 to n, inclusive. Additionally, the edges should be added to the graph in the correct direction.

### BUG 4: Incorrect parsing of the input

In the current code, the input is being parsed incorrectly. The variable `n` and `m` are being read using `map(int, input().split())`, but they are not being assigned to the corresponding variables `n` and `m`. This can be fixed by using the `map` function to assign the values directly to `n` and `m` in the input line.

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS

The bugs in the code have several impacts on the functionality of the program:

- The logic for determining if the graph is acyclic is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.
- The condition to check if a node has already been visited is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.
- The graph is constructed incorrectly, leading to incorrect graph representation.
- The input is parsed incorrectly, leading to incorrect values for `n` and `m`.

All of these bugs contribute to the incorrect output of the program.

### BUG 1: Incorrect logic for determining if the graph is acyclic

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for determining if the graph is acyclic. Instead of checking if a node has already been visited, we should check if the node is in the current path of the DFS traversal. If it is, then there is a cycle in the graph.

We can do this by passing a `visited` array to the DFS function and maintaining a separate `path` array to keep track of the nodes in the current path. If we encounter a node that is already in the `path` array, then there is a cycle and we should return `True`.

Here's the modified code to fix this bug:

```python
def is_cyclic_util(graph, node, visited, path):
    visited[node] = True
    path[node] = True

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, neighbor, visited, path):
                return True
        elif path[neighbor]:
            return True

    path[node] = False
    return False

def is_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    visited = [False] * (n+1)
    path = [False] * (n+1)

    for u in range(1, n+1):
        if not visited[u]:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, u, visited, path):
                return False

    return True
```

### BUG 2: Incorrect condition to check if a node has already been visited

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if a node has already been visited. Instead of checking if `visited[node]` is `True`, we should check if `visited[node] == 1`, as the `visited` array is initialized with `[False] * (n+1)`.

Here's the modified code to fix this bug:

```python
def is_cyclic_util(graph, node, visited, path):
    visited[node] = 1
    path[node] = True

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if visited[neighbor] == 0:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, neighbor, visited, path):
                return True
        elif path[neighbor]:
            return True

    path[node] = False
    return False
```

### BUG 3: Incorrect construction of the graph

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `graph` list with a size of `n`, not `n+1`. This is because the node indices range from 1 to n, inclusive.

Additionally, we need to add the edges to the graph in the correct direction. In the current code, the edges are added in the opposite direction, which is incorrect.

Here's the modified code to fix this bug:

```python
def is_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u-1].append(v-1)

    visited = [False] * n
    path = [False] * n

    for u in range(n):
        if not visited[u]:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, u, visited, path):
                return False

    return True
```

### BUG 4: Incorrect parsing of the input

To fix this bug, we need to assign the values of `n` and `m` directly from the `map` function in the input line. This can be done by removing the `map(int, ...)` part and directly assigning the values to `n` and `m`.

Here's the modified code to fix this bug:

```python
n, m = input().split()
n = int(n)
m = int(m)
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

if is_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

### Modified Python Code

```python
def is_cyclic_util(graph, node, visited, path):
    visited[node] = 1
    path[node] = True

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if visited[neighbor] == 0:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, neighbor, visited, path):
                return True
        elif path[neighbor]:
            return True

    path[node] = False
    return False

def is_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u-1].append(v-1)

    visited = [False] * n
    path = [False] * n

    for u in range(n):
        if not visited[u]:
            if is_cyclic_util(graph, u, visited, path):
                return False

    return True


n, m = input().split()
n = int(n)
m = int(m)
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

if is_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
