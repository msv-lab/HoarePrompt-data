The way the graph is constructed is incorrect.\n4. The way the input is being parsed is incorrect.\n\n### BUG 1: Incorrect logic for determining if the graph is acyclic\n\nIn the current code, the logic to determine if the graph is acyclic is incorrect. The code checks if a node has already been visited and returns `True`. However, this is not the correct condition to check for cycle detection. The code should check if the node is in the current path of the DFS traversal, and if so, there is a cycle.\n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect condition to check if a node has already been visited\n\nIn the current code, the condition to check if a node has already been visited is incorrect. The code checks if `visited[node]` is `True`, and if so, returns `True`. However, the correct condition to check if a node has already been visited is `visited[node] == 1`, as the `visited` list is initialized with `[False] * (n+1)`. Additionally, the condition for returning `True` should be within the inner `while` loop, not outside of it.\n\n### BUG 3: Incorrect construction of the graph\n\nIn the current code, the graph is constructed incorrectly. The variable `graph` is initialized as a list of empty lists with a size of `n+1`. However, the correct size for the graph should be `n`, as the node indices range from 1 to n, inclusive. Additionally, the edges should be added to the graph in the correct direction.\n\n### BUG 4: Incorrect parsing of the input\n\nIn the current code, the input is being parsed incorrectly. The variable `n` and `m` are being read using `map(int, input().split())`, but they are not being assigned to the corresponding variables `n` and `m`. This can be fixed by using the `map` function to assign the values directly to `n` and `m` in the input line.\n\n### IMPACT OF THE BUGS\n\nThe bugs in the code have several impacts on the functionality of the program:\n\n- The logic for determining if the graph is acyclic is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.\n- The condition to check if a node has already been visited is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.\n- The graph is constructed incorrectly, leading to incorrect graph representation.\n- The input is parsed incorrectly, leading to incorrect values for `n` and `m`.\n\nAll of these bugs contribute to the incorrect output of the program.",
