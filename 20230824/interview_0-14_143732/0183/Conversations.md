I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Amr doesn't like Maths as he finds it really boring, so he usually sleeps in Maths lectures. But one day the teacher suspected that Amr is sleeping and asked him a question to make sure he wasn't.

First he gave Amr two positive integers n and k. Then he asked Amr, how many integer numbers x > 0 exist such that:  Decimal representation of x (without leading zeroes) consists of exactly n digits;  There exists some integer y > 0 such that:   $y \operatorname{mod} k = 0$;  decimal representation of y is a suffix of decimal representation of x.  

As the answer to this question may be pretty huge the teacher asked Amr to output only its remainder modulo a number m.

Can you help Amr escape this embarrassing situation?


-----Input-----

Input consists of three integers n, k, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the required number modulo m.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1000

Output
4
Input
2 2 1000

Output
45
Input
5 3 1103

Output
590


-----Note-----

A suffix of a string S is a non-empty string that can be obtained by removing some number (possibly, zero) of first characters from S.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

    count = 0
    result = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible x values
    for x in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):

    return result % m

# Read inputs

# Calculate and print the count modulo m
print(count_numbers(n, k, m))
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1 2 1000
" the output was "20

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### CODE REVIEW

There are multiple bugs in the provided code. Let's go through them one by one:

1. In the `for` loop, the code is iterating over all possible values of `x` from 10^(n-1) to 10^n. But this is incorrect because it includes numbers with leading zeros, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. To fix this, we need to change the range of the loop to iterate over numbers without leading zeros. We can do this by changing the starting point of the range to 10^(n-1) + 1.

2. The condition `if x % k == 0` is incorrect because it checks if `x` is divisible by `k`, but it should be checking if there exists some `y > 0` such that `y % k == 0` and the decimal representation of `y` is a suffix of the decimal representation of `x`. To fix this, we need to check if `k` is divisible by `10^(length of y)`, where `y` is a positive integer suffix of `x`.

3. The variables `count` and `result` are not being used correctly. The variable `count` is supposed to keep track of the number of valid `x` values, but it is currently incrementing in each iteration of the loop, regardless of whether `y` exists or not. The variable `result` is supposed to store the sum of all valid `x` values, but it is currently adding `x` to it in each iteration, which will give incorrect results. To fix this, we need to move the increment of `count` and the addition of `x` to `result` inside the condition where `y` exists.

4. The function `count_numbers` is correct, but the way it is being used is incorrect. The `input()` function is being used to read the inputs, but it should be replaced with the actual inputs provided as arguments to the function.

5. The final result is calculated as `result % m`, but it should be `count % m`, because we need to output the number of valid `x` values modulo `m`, not the sum of those values.

Let me summarize the bug fixes:

1. Change the range of the loop to iterate over numbers without leading zeros.
2. Modify the condition to check if `k` is divisible by `10^(length of y)`.
3. Move the increment of `count` and the addition of `x` inside the condition where `y` exists.
4. Replace the `input()` function with the provided inputs as arguments to the function.
5. Calculate the final result as `count % m`, not `result % m`.

Please note that these bug fixes are based on my understanding of the problem statement. If my understanding is incorrect, please provide more clarification on the requirements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
