I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Dima loves representing an odd number as the sum of multiple primes, and Lisa loves it when there are at most three primes. Help them to represent the given number as the sum of at most than three primes.

More formally, you are given an odd numer n. Find a set of numbers p_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ k), such that



 1 ≤ k ≤ 3

 p_{i} is a prime

 $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i} = n$

The numbers p_{i} do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that at least one possible solution exists.


-----Input-----

The single line contains an odd number n (3 ≤ n < 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the first line print k (1 ≤ k ≤ 3), showing how many numbers are in the representation you found.

In the second line print numbers p_{i} in any order. If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
27

Output
3
5 11 11



-----Note-----

A prime is an integer strictly larger than one that is divisible only by one and by itself.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "27
" the output was "" but the expected output was "3
2 2 23".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

Upon reviewing the given code, I have identified the following bugs:

1. The function `is_prime(x)` incorrectly identifies the number 2 as a non-prime number. This is because the for loop in the function starts from 2 instead of 3.

2. When the input number `n` is prime, the code correctly identifies that the solution is the number itself. However, it should print the number of primes as 1, not 0.

3. When `n` is not a prime number, the code checks if `n - 2` is prime. However, it should check if `n - 3` is prime, as the loop starts from 3.

4. The loop condition in the for loop that starts from 3 and loops through all possible prime numbers less than `n` is incorrect. The condition `range(3, n, 2)` should be changed to `range(3, n - 2, 2)` to ensure that the last possible prime number is `n - 2`, as the second number in the output should be `n - 2` when it is a solution.

5. If no solution is found in the loop, the code does not handle this case and does not provide any output. A default output or error message should be provided in such cases.

These bugs have the following impact on the functionality of the program:

- The initial bug in the `is_prime(x)` function results in incorrect identification of prime numbers, leading to incorrect solutions being found. This affects the correctness of the program's output.

- The bug in printing the number of primes as 0 when the input number is prime leads to an incorrect representation of the solution and may confuse the user.

- The bugs in checking if `n - 2` is prime and in the loop condition result in incorrect prime combinations being found, leading to incorrect solutions.

- The lack of handling the case when no solution is found results in no output being provided, which is not desired behavior.

To fix these bugs, the following changes can be made:

1. In the `is_prime(x)` function, start the for loop from 3 instead of 2.

2. In the section where `n` is checked for primality, change the print statement to print 1 instead of 0.

3. Change the check from `is_prime(n - 2)` to `is_prime(n - 3)`.

4. In the range of the for loop that loops through possible prime numbers less than `n`, change the loop condition to `range(3, n - 2, 2)`.

5. Add an else block after the for loop that prints a default output or error message when no solution is found.

By making these changes, the program should be able to correctly find the prime combination that represents the input number.
