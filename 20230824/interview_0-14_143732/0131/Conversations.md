I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "No

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code:

1. The first bug is in the condition `x[i] > y[i]`. This condition is checking if the number of stones in pile `x[i]` is greater than the number of stones in pile `y[i]`. However, the prompt states that during the night, each jury member either takes one stone for themselves or moves one stone from one pile to another. Therefore, it is possible for the number of stones in pile `y[i]` to be greater than the number of stones in pile `x[i]`. This condition should be changed to `abs(x[i] - y[i]) > 1` to check if the difference between the number of stones in pile `x[i]` and `y[i]` is greater than 1.

2. The second bug is in the condition `x[i] < x[i-1]`. This condition is checking if the number of stones in pile `x[i]` is less than the number of stones in pile `x[i-1]`, which suggests that the number of stones is decreasing from pile to pile. However, the prompt does not mention that the number of stones should be strictly increasing or decreasing. Therefore, this condition should be removed.

3. The third bug is in the condition `x[i] > x[i+1]`. This condition is checking if the number of stones in pile `x[i]` is greater than the number of stones in pile `x[i+1]`, which suggests that the number of stones is increasing from pile to pile. However, the prompt does not mention that the number of stones should be strictly increasing or decreasing. Therefore, this condition should be removed.

### BUGS
1. The condition `x[i] > y[i]` should be changed to `abs(x[i] - y[i]) > 1`.
2. The condition `x[i] < x[i-1]` should be removed.
3. The condition `x[i] > x[i+1]` should be removed.

### CORRECTED CODE
```python
def check_stones(n, x, y):
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(x[i] - y[i]) > 1:
            return "No"
    return "Yes"

n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(check_stones(n, x, y))
```

### IMPACT
The bugs in the code affect the correctness of the program. The incorrect conditions prevent the code from correctly determining whether the records can be consistent or not. As a result, the code may incorrectly output "No" when the records can actually be consistent, leading to incorrect results.

# Solution

```python
def check_stones(n, x, y):
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(x[i] - y[i]) > 1:
            return "No"
    return "Yes"

n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(check_stones(n, x, y))
```
The bugs in the code have been fixed. The condition `x[i] > y[i]` has been changed to `abs(x[i] - y[i]) > 1` to check for a difference of more than 1 stone. The conditions `x[i] < x[i-1]` and `x[i] > x[i+1]` have been removed as they are not required. Now the code will correctly determine whether the records can be consistent or not.
