I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had c pages.

At first day Mister B read v_0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v_0 pages, at second — v_0 + a pages, at third — v_0 + 2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v_1 pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.


-----Input-----

First and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v_0, v_1, a and l (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5 10 5 4

Output
1

Input
12 4 12 4 1

Output
3

Input
15 1 100 0 0

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the first sample test the book contains 5 pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day — 4 - 11, at third day — 11 - 12 and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)

Output

Input

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day — 4 - 11, at third day — 11 - 12 and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
c, v0, v1, a, l = map(int, input().split())

days = 1
pages_read = v0
while pages_read < c:
    v = min(pages_read + a, v1)
    pages_read += v - l
    days += 1

print(days)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "15 1 100 0 0
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "15
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "15 1 100 0 0
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "15
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            #### Review
The code you provided seems to have a few bugs. I will go through each section and explain the issues I found.

##### Input Parsing
The input parsing section seems correct and should be functioning as intended.

##### Calculation Logic
The logic to calculate the number of days seems to have some issues. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. `days = 1` - In this line, you're initializing the variable `days` to 1. However, this assumes that Mister B finishes reading the book in one day. This assumption is incorrect because it's possible for him to take more than one day to finish reading the book.

2. `pages_read = v0` - This line initializes the `pages_read` variable to `v0`. This is correct as Mister B starts by reading `v0` pages.

3. `while pages_read < c:` - This while loop checks if the number of pages read is less than the total number of pages in the book. This is the correct condition for the loop.

4. `v = min(pages_read + a, v1)` - This line calculates the new reading speed for the day. However, the calculation seems to be incorrect. You should be calculating the reading speed for the next day by adding `a` to the previous day's reading speed, not to the `pages_read` variable. The correct calculation would be `v = min(v + a, v1)`.

5. `pages_read += v - l` - This line updates the `pages_read` variable by subtracting `l` from the new reading speed `v`. However, this is incorrect as `l` is the number of pages Mister B needs to reread, not subtract from the reading speed. The correct calculation should be `pages_read += v - l + 1` to account for the new pages read on the current day.

6. `days += 1` - This line increments the `days` variable by 1 for each day Mister B reads. This seems correct.

##### Output
The output section seems correct as it prints the final value of the `days` variable.

#### Bugs
Based on the review above, the bugs in your code are as follows:

1. Incorrect initialization of the `days` variable.
2. Incorrect calculation of the new reading speed `v`.
3. Incorrect calculation of the `pages_read` variable.

These bugs impact the functionality of the code by incorrectly calculating the number of days to finish the book.

#### Suggestions
To fix the issues identified above, you can make the following changes to your code:

1. Change the initialization of the `days` variable to `days = 0` since Mister B hasn't started reading the book yet.
2. In the line `v = min(pages_read + a, v1)`, change it to `v = min(v + a, v1)` to correctly calculate the new reading speed.
3. In the line `pages_read += v - l`, change it to `pages_read += v - l + 1` to correctly calculate the number of pages read.

After making these changes, your code should be able to correctly calculate the number of days Mister B needs to finish the book.
