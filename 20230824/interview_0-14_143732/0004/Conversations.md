I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

    m -= x
    if m < 0:

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
11 23
" the output was "1
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code provided aims to find the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until he reaches his desired wake-up time.

To achieve this, the code:

1. Takes input x, representing the number of minutes between each press of the snooze button.
2. Takes input h and m, representing the desired wake-up time in hours and minutes.
3. Initializes a counter variable to keep track of the number of times the snooze button is pressed.
4. Enters an infinite loop.
5. Decrements the minutes by x, adjusting the hours accordingly when necessary.
6. Checks if the current time (h and m) contains the digit '7'.
7. Breaks out of the loop if the time is lucky (contains '7').
8. Increments the counter if the time is not lucky.
9. Prints the final value of the counter.

### BUGS

1. Inaccurate calculation of the number of times the snooze button is pressed:
    - The calculation of the counter variable is incorrect because it is incremented before checking if the current time is lucky.
    - This leads to an underestimation of the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button.
    - For the input "3 11 23", the code incorrectly outputs "1" instead of the expected "2".

2. Incorrect handling of negative values for minutes and hours:
    - When decrementing the minutes in the while loop, the code should handle the case when the result becomes negative correctly.
    - Currently, the code only adjusts the minutes by adding 60, but does not decrement the hour accordingly.
    - This results in inaccurate time calculations and may lead to incorrect lucky time detection.
    
3. Incorrect calculation of lucky time:
    - The code checks if the digits '7' are present in either the hour or the minute separately, rather than looking for them in the combined time.
    - This means that the code does not correctly identify lucky times.
    - For example, the code incorrectly identifies "11:07" as a lucky time because it checks if '7' is present in '11' and '07' separately.
    - However, the code correctly identifies "13:07" as a lucky time because it checks if '7' is present in '13' or '07'.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Move the increment of the counter variable after checking if the time is lucky.
    - By moving the increment after the lucky time check, the code will correctly capture the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button.
    - This involves swapping the two lines:
        - `counter += 1` should be moved below `if '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m):`

2. Adjust the hour when the minutes become negative correctly.
    - When decrementing the minutes in the while loop, the code should decrement the hour by 1 when the minutes become negative.
    - This requires adding an additional if statement to check if the minutes become negative, and decrement the hour accordingly.
    - The if statement should be placed after `m -= x` and before the first `if m < 0:` statement.
    - The if statement should have the condition `if m < 0:` and as the body `m += 60` and `h -= 1`.

3. Check if the lucky digit '7' is present in the combined time.
    - Currently, the code checks if '7' is present in the hour separately and the minutes separately.
    - To correctly identify lucky times, the code should check if '7' is present in the combined time.
    - This can be achieved by combining the hour and minutes into a single string and checking if '7' is present in that string.
    - The check should replace the condition `if '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m):` with the condition `if '7' in str(h) + str(m):`.

### CODE REVISION

```python
x = int(input())
h, m = map(int, input().split())

counter = 0
while True:
    m -= x
    if m < 0:
        m += 60
        h -= 1
    if m < 0:
        m += 60
    if '7' in str(h) + str(m):
        break
    counter += 1

print(counter)
```

### BUG-INTRODUCING INCOMPLETE CODE

```python
x = int(input())
h, m = map(int, input().split())

counter = 0
while True:
    m -= x
    if m < 0:
        m += 60
        h -= 1
    if '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m):
        break
    counter += 1

print(counter)
