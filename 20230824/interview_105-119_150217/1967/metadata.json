          "feedback": "### BUGS\n\nThere are several bugs in the code:\n\nBug 1: Incorrect rotation\nThe code rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise, but it actually rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This bug occurs in the following lines:\n```python\nfor i in range(w):\n    rotated_row = []\n    for j in range(h):\n        rotated_row.append(image[j][i])\n    rotated_row.reverse()\n    rotated_image.append(rotated_row)\n```\nThe correct rotation should be:\n```python\nfor i in range(w-1, -1, -1):\n    rotated_row = ''\n    for j in range(h):\n        rotated_row += image[j][i]\n    rotated_image.append(rotated_row)\n```\n\nBug 2: Incorrect flipping\nThe code flips the image horizontally, but it actually flips it vertically. This bug occurs in the following lines:\n```python\nflipped_image = []\nfor row in rotated_image:\n    flipped_row = row[::-1]\n    flipped_image.append(flipped_row)\n```\nThe correct flip should be:\n```python\nflipped_image = []\nfor row in rotated_image[::-1]:\n    flipped_image.append(row)\n```\n\nBug 3: Incorrect zooming\nThe code zooms in twice on the image by doubling all the linear sizes, but it actually quadruples the image. This bug occurs in the following lines:\n```python\nzoomed_image = []\nfor row in flipped_image:\n    zoomed_row = \"\"\n    for pixel in row:\n        zoomed_row += pixel * 2\n    zoomed_image.append(zoomed_row)\n```\nThe correct zooming should be:\n```python\nzoomed_image = []\nfor row in flipped_image:\n    zoomed_row = \"\"\n    for pixel in row:\n        zoomed_row += pixel * 2\n    zoomed_image.append(zoomed_row)\n    zoomed_image.append(zoomed_row)\n```\n\n### IMPACT\n\nThese bugs have the following impacts on the program's functionality:\n\nBug 1: Incorrect rotation\nThe image is rotated in the wrong direction, resulting in an incorrect output. The rotated image will be flipped vertically.\n\nBug 2: Incorrect flipping\nThe image is flipped vertically instead of horizontally, resulting in an incorrect output. The flipped image will appear rotated 180 degrees.\n\nBug 3: Incorrect zooming\nThe image is zoomed in by quadrupling all the linear sizes instead of doubling them. This results in an incorrect output. The zoomed image will appear twice as large as expected.\n\nAs a result of these bugs, the program produces incorrect output, deviating from the expected results.",
