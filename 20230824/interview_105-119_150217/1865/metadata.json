          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n\nThere are a few issues in the code provided:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code is missing the necessary part to parse the input.\n2. **Incorrect Loop**: The loop that iterates over the array to find the minimum element to swap is not correct. It iterates from `i+1` to `n`, which means it is missing the last element of the array. The correct range should be `i+1` to `n-1`.\n3. **Incorrect Swapping**: The swapping logic is incorrect. It swaps the values of `array[i]` and `array[min_index]`, but the expected output swaps `array[i]` with `array[min_index]`. The correct swapping logic should be `array[i], array[min_index] = array[min_index], array[i]`.\n4. **Printing Incorrect Swaps**: The code is printing the indices of the swaps in the incorrect order. The expected output prints `i` and `j` in the order of the swaps, but the code prints `i` and `j` in the order of the original array.\n\nLet's go through the code step by step and explain the issues in more detail.\n\n### BUG 1: Input Parsing\nThe code is missing the necessary part to parse the input. It reads `n` and `array` from the input, but the input is not being read properly. The code should use the `input()` function to read the input.\n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect Loop\nThe loop that iterates over the array to find the minimum element to swap is not correct. Let's take the example input `5 2 5 1 4` to explain the issue.\n\nOn the first iteration of the outer loop, `i` is 0. The code then iterates from `i+1` to `n`, which is `1` to `5`. However, the correct range should be `i+1` to `n-1`, which is `1` to `4` to include all the elements in the array.\n\nThis issue results in the last element of the array not being considered for swapping, leading to incorrect results.\n\n### BUG 3: Incorrect Swapping\nThe code swaps the values of `array[i]` and `array[min_index]`, but the expected output swaps `array[i]` with `array[min_index]`.\n\nFor example, if the array is `[3, 1, 2]` and `i` is 0, the code swaps `array[0]` (which is 3) with `array[min_index]` (which is 1). This results in the array becoming `[1, 3, 2]`. However, the expected output swaps `array[i]` (which is 3) with `array[min_index]` (which is 1), resulting in the array becoming `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nTo fix this issue, the code should swap `array[i]` with `array[min_index]` instead of swapping the values.\n\n### BUG 4: Printing Incorrect Swaps\nThe code is printing the indices of the swaps in the incorrect order. The expected output prints `i` and `j` in the order of the swaps, but the code prints `i` and `j` in the order of the original array.\n\nFor example, if the swaps are `(0, 3)` and `(4, 2)`, the code would print `0 3` and `4 2`. However, the expected output is `0 3` and `2 4`.\n\nTo fix this issue, the code should print `i` and `j` in the order of the swaps.\n\n### SUMMARY\nTo summarize, the issues in the code are as follows:\n\n1. Input parsing is missing.\n2. The loop that finds the minimum element to swap is incorrect.\n3. Swapping is performed incorrectly.\n4. The printing of swaps is done in the incorrect order.\n\nThese issues result in incorrect output for the given example input.",
