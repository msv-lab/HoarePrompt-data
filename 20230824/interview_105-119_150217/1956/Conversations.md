I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Lee is used to finish his stories in a stylish way, this time he barely failed it, but Ice Bear came and helped him. Lee is so grateful for it, so he decided to show Ice Bear his new game called "Critic"...

The game is a one versus one game. It has $t$ rounds, each round has two integers $s_i$ and $e_i$ (which are determined and are known before the game begins, $s_i$ and $e_i$ may differ from round to round). The integer $s_i$ is written on the board at the beginning of the corresponding round. 

The players will take turns. Each player will erase the number on the board (let's say it was $a$) and will choose to write either $2 \cdot a$ or $a + 1$ instead. Whoever writes a number strictly greater than $e_i$ loses that round and the other one wins that round.

Now Lee wants to play "Critic" against Ice Bear, for each round he has chosen the round's $s_i$ and $e_i$ in advance. Lee will start the first round, the loser of each round will start the next round.

The winner of the last round is the winner of the game, and the loser of the last round is the loser of the game.

Determine if Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves or not. Also, determine if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of rounds the game has. 

Then $t$ lines follow, each contains two integers $s_i$ and $e_i$ ($1 \le s_i \le e_i \le 10^{18}$) — the $i$-th round's information.

The rounds are played in the same order as given in input, $s_i$ and $e_i$ for all rounds are known to everyone before the game starts.


-----Output-----

Print two integers.

The first one should be 1 if Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves, and 0 otherwise.

The second one should be 1 if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves, and 0 otherwise.

Output

-----Note-----

Remember, whoever writes an integer greater than $e_i$ loses.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
" the output was "1 1
" but the expected output was "0 0
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the code that can cause unexpected results.

#### Bug 1: Misinterpretation of winning condition
In the code, the winning condition is incorrectly determined. The code checks if the difference between `e` and `s` is odd `(e - s) % 2 == 1` to determine if Lee can always win. However, this is incorrect. The condition should be that `(e - s) % 2 == 0` because if the difference between `e` and `s` is odd, then halfway between `s` and `e` will be a non-integer number, which means neither `2 * a` nor `a + 1` can reach `e`. Therefore, the correct condition for Lee to always win is that `(e - s) % 2 == 0`.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect calculation for losing condition
The code incorrectly checks if `e // 2 < s` to determine if Lee can always lose. This condition is incorrect because it assumes that Lee always chooses `2 * a` on their turn, which is not stated in the problem statement. Lee can choose either `2 * a` or `a + 1` on their turn. Therefore, the condition for Lee to always lose cannot be simply `e // 2 < s`. 

#### Bug 3: Overwriting can_win and can_lose variables
The code incorrectly overwrites the `can_win` and `can_lose` variables on each iteration of the loop. This means that the final values of these variables will only reflect the conditions of the last round, rather than considering all the rounds. 

### BUG FIXES

To fix the code and address the bugs mentioned above, we need to make the following changes:

1. Initialize the `can_win` and `can_lose` variables outside the loop and set their initial values to `1`. This will allow us to consider the conditions of all the rounds in the loop.

2. Update the condition for Lee to always win to `(e - s) % 2 == 0`.

3. Remove the incorrect condition `e // 2 < s` for Lee to always lose and leave it as `can_lose = 1`. This will indicate that Lee can always lose if the condition is not met.

4. After the loop, print the values of `can_win` and `can_lose`.
