I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You have m = n·k wooden staves. The i-th stave has length a_{i}. You have to assemble n barrels consisting of k staves each, you can use any k staves to construct a barrel. Each stave must belong to exactly one barrel.

Let volume v_{j} of barrel j be equal to the length of the minimal stave in it. [Image] 

You want to assemble exactly n barrels with the maximal total sum of volumes. But you have to make them equal enough, so a difference between volumes of any pair of the resulting barrels must not exceed l, i.e. |v_{x} - v_{y}| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.

Print maximal total sum of volumes of equal enough barrels or 0 if it's impossible to satisfy the condition above.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n·k ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ l ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains m = n·k space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — lengths of staves.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximal total sum of the volumes of barrels or 0 if it's impossible to construct exactly n barrels satisfying the condition |v_{x} - v_{y}| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2 1
2 2 1 2 3 2 2 3

Output
7

Input
2 1 0
10 10

Output
20

Input
1 2 1
5 2

Output
2

Input
3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form the following barrels: [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 3].

In the second example you can form the following barrels: [10], [10].

In the third example you can form the following barrels: [2, 5].

In the fourth example difference between volumes of barrels in any partition is at least 2 so it is impossible to make barrels equal enough.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the given code that are causing incorrect output:

#### Bug 1: Incorrect condition for checking barrel feasibility
The condition for checking if it's possible to construct n barrels with the given staves is incorrect. The code checks if the difference between the length of the kth stave and the first stave is greater than l, which is not the correct condition. Instead, we need to check if the difference between the maximum length stave and the minimum length stave within a barrel is greater than l.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of index range for calculating volume
The code incorrectly calculates the index range for calculating the volume of each barrel in the partition. Instead of using `staves[i*k : (i+1)*k]`, we need to use `staves[i*k : i*k + k]` to ensure that we are considering only the k staves for each barrel.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect calculation of maximum total sum of volumes
The code calculates the maximum total sum of volumes incorrectly. It calculates the sum of the minimum length stave for each barrel, which is not the correct calculation. Instead, we need to calculate the sum of the volumes of the barrels, where the volume of each barrel is defined as the length of the minimal stave in it.

### SOLUTION

The given code contains bugs that need to be fixed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
n, k, l = map(int, input().split())
staves = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the staves in ascending order
staves.sort()

# Check if it's possible to construct n barrels with the given staves
if staves[k-1] - staves[0] > l:
    print(0)
else:
    # Find the maximum total sum of volumes
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the volume for each barrel in the partition
        volume = staves[i*k : i*k + k]
        max_sum += min(volume)
    print(max_sum)
```

Explanation of Fixes:

1. In the bug 1 fix, I changed the condition for checking the feasibility of constructing n barrels. Instead of checking the difference between the length of the kth stave and the first stave, I now check the difference between the maximum length stave and the minimum length stave within a barrel.

2. In the bug 2 fix, I corrected the index range for calculating the volume of each barrel in the partition. Instead of using `(i+1)*k`, I now use `i*k + k` to ensure that we are considering only the k staves for each barrel.

3. In the bug 3 fix, I changed the calculation of the maximum total sum of volumes. Instead of calculating the sum of the minimum length stave for each barrel, I now calculate the sum of the volumes of the barrels, where the volume of each barrel is defined as the length of the minimal stave in it.

The corrected code should now give the correct output for the given input.
