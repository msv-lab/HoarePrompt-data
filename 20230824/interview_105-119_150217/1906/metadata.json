However, this approach is not efficient and does not effectively check divisibility for all numbers from 2 to 10.\n3. The code only checks for divisibility by prime numbers, i.e., 2, 3, 5, and 7. It does not consider divisibility by numbers such as 4, 6, 8, and 9.\n\n### BUG 1:\nThe code does not handle the case when n is equal to 1.\n\n### BUG 2:\nThe code uses a brute force approach to check divisibility for each number from 1 to n. However, this approach is not efficient and does not effectively check divisibility for all numbers from 2 to 10.\n\n### BUG 3:\nThe code only checks for divisibility by prime numbers, i.e., 2, 3, 5, and 7. It does not consider divisibility by numbers such as 4, 6, 8, and 9.\n\n### IMPACT:\nThese bugs cause the code to produce incorrect results for certain inputs. There is a discrepancy between the actual output and the expected output for the given test case.\n\nTo determine the correct number of times Petya will get a bonus, a different approach is required to efficiently check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to 10, and the handling of the edge case when n is equal to 1 must be addressed.",
