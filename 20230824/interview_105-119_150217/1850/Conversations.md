I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Formula 1 officials decided to introduce new competition. Cars are replaced by space ships and number of points awarded can differ per race.

Given the current ranking in the competition and points distribution for the next race, your task is to calculate the best possible ranking for a given astronaut after the next race. It's guaranteed that given astronaut will have unique number of points before the race.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200000$) representing number of F1 astronauts, and current position of astronaut $D$ ($1 \leq D \leq N$) you want to calculate best ranking for (no other competitor will have the same number of points before the race).

The second line contains $N$ integer numbers $S_k$ ($0 \leq S_k \leq 10^8$, $k=1...N$), separated by a single space, representing current ranking of astronauts. Points are sorted in non-increasing order.

The third line contains $N$ integer numbers $P_k$ ($0 \leq P_k \leq 10^8$, $k=1...N$), separated by a single space, representing point awards for the next race. Points are sorted in non-increasing order, so winner of the race gets the maximum number of points.


-----Output-----

Output contains one integer number — the best possible ranking for astronaut after the race. If multiple astronauts have the same score after the race, they all share the best ranking.


-----Example-----
Input
4 3
50 30 20 10
15 10 7 3

Output
2



-----Note-----

If the third ranked astronaut wins the race, he will have 35 points. He cannot take the leading position, but he can overtake the second position if the second ranked astronaut finishes the race at the last position.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4 3
50 30 20 10
15 10 7 3
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
There are several bugs in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The function `calculate_best_ranking` does not consider the case where the astronaut wins the race. The condition `current_ranking[i] > points_before_race + points_awarded` should be modified to `current_ranking[i] >= points_before_race + points_awarded` in order to handle this case.

2. The variable `best_ranking` is initialized with a value of 1, but it should be initialized with a value of D instead, since the astronaut's current position is known and will not change if they do not overtake any other ranking positions.

3. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should start from index D instead of 0, since the astronaut's current position is known and there is no need to check rankings that come before it.

4. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should iterate until N-1 instead of N, since the astronaut's current position is known and there is no need to check rankings that come after it.

5. The input reading code is not correct. The variables N and D are read, but the actual input for current_ranking and point_awards is not read and stored.

6. The program does not account for the possibility of multiple astronauts having the same score after the race. The code only calculates the best possible ranking for the given astronaut, but it does not check if there are other astronauts with the same score.

7. The code should only calculate the best possible ranking after the race for the given astronaut, not for all astronauts. The variable N is not needed as a parameter in the function `calculate_best_ranking`.

### BUGS
1. The function `calculate_best_ranking` does not consider the case where the astronaut wins the race. The condition `current_ranking[i] > points_before_race + points_awarded` should be modified to `current_ranking[i] >= points_before_race + points_awarded` in order to handle this case.

2. The variable `best_ranking` is initialized with a value of 1, but it should be initialized with a value of D instead, since the astronaut's current position is known and will not change if they do not overtake any other ranking positions.

3. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should start from index D instead of 0, since the astronaut's current position is known and there is no need to check rankings that come before it.

4. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should iterate until N-1 instead of N, since the astronaut's current position is known and there is no need to check rankings that come after it.

5. The input reading code is not correct. The variables N and D are read, but the actual input for current_ranking and point_awards is not read and stored.

6. The program does not account for the possibility of multiple astronauts having the same score after the race. The code only calculates the best possible ranking for the given astronaut, but it does not check if there are other astronauts with the same score.

7. The code should only calculate the best possible ranking after the race for the given astronaut, not for all astronauts. The variable N is not needed as a parameter in the function `calculate_best_ranking`.

### IMPACT
1. The current implementation does not handle the case where the astronaut wins the race. This bug will lead to incorrect results if the astronaut wins the race. The astronaut's ranking will not be updated correctly in this case, and they may still have the same rank as before the race.

2. The incorrect initialization of the variable `best_ranking` will lead to incorrect results. The astronaut's current position will not be taken into account, and the value of `best_ranking` will be incorrect if they do not overtake any other ranking positions.

3. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should start from index D instead of 0. This bug will lead to unnecessary iterations and will not consider the astronaut's current position correctly when checking rankings.

4. The loop in the function `calculate_best_ranking` should iterate until N-1 instead of N. This bug will lead to unnecessary iterations and will not consider the astronaut's current position correctly when checking rankings.

5. The input reading code is not correct. The actual input for current_ranking and point_awards is not read and stored, which will lead to incorrect results since the program will not have the correct input values to perform the calculations.

6. The program does not account for the possibility of multiple astronauts having the same score after the race. This bug will lead to incorrect results if there are other astronauts with the same score as the given astronaut. The program will not correctly identify the best ranking in this case.

7. The code should only calculate the best possible ranking after the race for the given astronaut, not for all astronauts. Including the variable N as a parameter in the function `calculate_best_ranking` is unnecessary and will not produce the desired result.
