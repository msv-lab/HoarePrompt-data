          "feedback": "### FEEDBACK\nThere are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.\n\n1. Bug: The code only checks for pairs of opening and closing brackets in each individual sequence. It does not consider connecting different sequences to form correct bracket sequences.\n   - Impact: This bug prevents the code from correctly forming pairs and finding the maximum number of pairs.\n\n2. Bug: The code incorrectly calculates the pair count by dividing it by 2 at the end.\n   - Impact: This bug causes the code to output half of the correct result.\n\nTo fix these bugs, the code needs to be modified to consider connecting different sequences and to fix the calculation of the pair count.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few improvements that can be made to the code:\n\n1. Improvement: The stack can be modified to store the indices of opening brackets within each individual sequence. This will make it easier to track which opening bracket corresponds to which closing bracket.\n2. Improvement: To find pairs of brackets, the code can check if there are any opening brackets in the stack when encountering a closing bracket. If there are, it can form a pair and remove the corresponding opening bracket from the stack.\n3. Improvement: Instead of manually reading the input values, the code can make use of function parameters to pass the input values.\n\nLet's address these issues in detail.",
