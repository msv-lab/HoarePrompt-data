I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
One day, Yuhao came across a problem about checking if some bracket sequences are correct bracket sequences.

A bracket sequence is any non-empty sequence of opening and closing parentheses. A bracket sequence is called a correct bracket sequence if it's possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, the sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are correct, while the bracket sequences ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not correct.

Yuhao found this problem too simple for him so he decided to make the problem harder. You are given many (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences. The task is to connect some of them into ordered pairs so that each bracket sequence occurs in at most one pair and the concatenation of the bracket sequences in each pair is a correct bracket sequence. The goal is to create as many pairs as possible.

This problem unfortunately turned out to be too difficult for Yuhao. Can you help him and solve it?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the number of bracket sequences.

Each of the following $n$ lines contains one bracket sequence — a non-empty string which consists only of characters "(" and ")".

The sum of lengths of all bracket sequences in the input is at most $5 \cdot 10^5$.

Note that a bracket sequence may appear in the input multiple times. In this case, you can use each copy of the sequence separately. Also note that the order in which strings appear in the input doesn't matter.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of pairs which can be made, adhering to the conditions in the statement.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
)())
)
((
((
(
)
)

Output
2

Input
4
(
((
(((
(())

Output
0

Input
2
(())
()

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, it's optimal to construct two pairs: "((     )())" and "(     )".
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Plan

To create pairs of bracket sequences, we need to match each opening bracket "(" with a closing bracket ")" in another sequence. We can achieve this by using a stack data structure.

1. Create an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each bracket sequence:
   a. For each sequence, iterate through each character:
      i. If the character is an opening bracket "(":
         - Push the index of the opening bracket onto the stack.
      ii. If the character is a closing bracket ")":
         - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, continue to the next iteration.
         - Pop the index of the opening bracket from the stack.
3. After iterating through all sequences, the stack will contain indices of unmatched opening brackets. Divide the length of the stack by 2 to get the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
4. Print the maximum number of pairs.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the sum of lengths of all bracket sequences. This is because we iterate through each character in each sequence once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the stack that can contain at most n/2 elements.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### FEEDBACK
There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.

1. Bug: The code only checks for pairs of opening and closing brackets in each individual sequence. It does not consider connecting different sequences to form correct bracket sequences.
   - Impact: This bug prevents the code from correctly forming pairs and finding the maximum number of pairs.

2. Bug: The code incorrectly calculates the pair count by dividing it by 2 at the end.
   - Impact: This bug causes the code to output half of the correct result.

To fix these bugs, the code needs to be modified to consider connecting different sequences and to fix the calculation of the pair count.

Additionally, there are a few improvements that can be made to the code:

1. Improvement: The stack can be modified to store the indices of opening brackets within each individual sequence. This will make it easier to track which opening bracket corresponds to which closing bracket.
2. Improvement: To find pairs of brackets, the code can check if there are any opening brackets in the stack when encountering a closing bracket. If there are, it can form a pair and remove the corresponding opening bracket from the stack.
3. Improvement: Instead of manually reading the input values, the code can make use of function parameters to pass the input values.

Let's address these issues in detail.

To fix the bugs and implement the required improvements, the following changes need to be made in the code:

1. Instead of passing individual parameters to the `maximum_pairs` function, we can modify the function to receive a single string `input_string` as input. This string will contain the input values separated by newline characters. We can then split this string to extract the necessary values.

2. We need to update the logic in the `maximum_pairs` function to connect different bracket sequences and find the maximum number of pairs. To do this, we can modify the stack to store tuples (index, sequence_number) instead of just indices. The sequence_number will represent the index of the sequence in the `sequences` list. This will help us keep track of which opening bracket corresponds to which closing bracket.

3. Instead of looping over each character in the sequence, we can use the `enumerate` function directly on the `sequences` list to get both the index and the sequence itself.

4. We can simplify the code by using a single loop to iterate over all the sequences and characters. 

5. When encountering an opening bracket, we can simply append a tuple (i, seq_num) to the stack, where i is the index of the character and seq_num is the index of the sequence.

6. When encountering a closing bracket, we can check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, we ignore the closing bracket and continue to the next character.

7. If the stack is not empty, we can form a pair by popping the last tuple from the stack and incrementing the pair_count variable. We can then remove the corresponding opening bracket from the sequence by replacing it with an empty string.

8. After processing all the characters in the sequence, we can check if the stack is empty. If it is not empty, it means there are opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket. In this case, we need to remove all the opening brackets from the sequence and decrement the pair_count variable accordingly.

9. Finally, we can return the pair_count variable divided by 2, as the current implementation incorrectly divides it by 2.

Here's the updated code that takes into account the feedback and implements the necessary fixes and improvements:
