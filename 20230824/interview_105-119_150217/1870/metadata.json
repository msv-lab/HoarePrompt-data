Let's examine the code to identify the bugs and understand the impact they have on the program's functionality.\n\n### BUG 1:\nThe first bug is present in the logic of the program. The code only checks the time difference between consecutive words and increments the count if the difference is less than or equal to c. However, this approach does not account for the total time difference between the first word and the current word.\n\nFor example, consider the input \"6 5\\n1 3 8 14 19 20\". According to the code, when the third word is typed at the second 8, the time difference between the second and third word is 5, which is less than or equal to c. Therefore, the count is incremented. However, the code fails to consider that the total time difference from the first word to the current word is 8 - 1 = 7, which is greater than c. Hence, all previously typed words should be discarded, and the count should be reset to 1.\n\n### IMPACT:\nThis bug causes the program to erroneously count words that should have been discarded. It leads to an incorrect output and does not solve the problem as intended.",
