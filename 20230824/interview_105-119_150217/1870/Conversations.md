I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
ZS the Coder is coding on a crazy computer. If you don't type in a word for a c consecutive seconds, everything you typed disappear! 

More formally, if you typed a word at second a and then the next word at second b, then if b - a ≤ c, just the new word is appended to other words on the screen. If b - a > c, then everything on the screen disappears and after that the word you have typed appears on the screen.

For example, if c = 5 and you typed words at seconds 1, 3, 8, 14, 19, 20 then at the second 8 there will be 3 words on the screen. After that, everything disappears at the second 13 because nothing was typed. At the seconds 14 and 19 another two words are typed, and finally, at the second 20, one more word is typed, and a total of 3 words remain on the screen.

You're given the times when ZS the Coder typed the words. Determine how many words remain on the screen after he finished typing everything.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9) — the number of words ZS the Coder typed and the crazy computer delay respectively.

The next line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 ≤ t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_{n} ≤ 10^9), where t_{i} denotes the second when ZS the Coder typed the i-th word.


-----Output-----

Print a single positive integer, the number of words that remain on the screen after all n words was typed, in other words, at the second t_{n}.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 5
1 3 8 14 19 20

Output
3
Input
6 1
1 3 5 7 9 10

Output
2


-----Note-----

The first sample is already explained in the problem statement.

For the second sample, after typing the first word at the second 1, it disappears because the next word is typed at the second 3 and 3 - 1 > 1. Similarly, only 1 word will remain at the second 9. Then, a word is typed at the second 10, so there will be two words on the screen, as the old word won't disappear because 10 - 9 ≤ 1.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6 5
1 3 8 14 19 20
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "3".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code provided attempts to solve the problem, but it contains a logical error that causes incorrect output. Let's examine the code to identify the bugs and understand the impact they have on the program's functionality.

### BUG 1:
The first bug is present in the logic of the program. The code only checks the time difference between consecutive words and increments the count if the difference is less than or equal to c. However, this approach does not account for the total time difference between the first word and the current word.

For example, consider the input "6 5\n1 3 8 14 19 20". According to the code, when the third word is typed at the second 8, the time difference between the second and third word is 5, which is less than or equal to c. Therefore, the count is incremented. However, the code fails to consider that the total time difference from the first word to the current word is 8 - 1 = 7, which is greater than c. Hence, all previously typed words should be discarded, and the count should be reset to 1.

### IMPACT:
This bug causes the program to erroneously count words that should have been discarded. It leads to an incorrect output and does not solve the problem as intended.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the program to consider the total time difference between the first word and the current word. If this total difference is greater than c, we should discard all previously typed words and reset the count to 1.

### Plan
1. Initialize `count` to 1, representing the first word that is always on the screen.
2. Iterate over the words from index 1 to n-1.
3. For each word at index i, calculate the total time difference by subtracting the time of the first word (words[0]) from the time of the current word (words[i]).
4. If the total time difference is less than or equal to c, increment `count` by 1.
5. If the total time difference is greater than c, discard all previously typed words and reset `count` to 1.
6. After the loop, `count` will represent the number of words remaining on the screen at the time of the last word (t_n).
7. Print `count`.

### Corrected Code
Below is the corrected code that incorporates the bug fix.

```python
n, c = map(int, input().split())
words = list(map(int, input().split()))
count = 1

for i in range(1, n):
    if words[i] - words[i-1] <= c:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 1

print(count)
```

With this bug fix, the code should now return the correct output for the given test case as well as other test cases.
