I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string t_{i} occurs in string s at least k_{i} times or more, he also remembers exactly k_{i} positions where the string t_{i} occurs in string s: these positions are x_{i}, 1, x_{i}, 2, ..., x_{i}, k_{i}. He remembers n such strings t_{i}.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings t_{i} and string s consist of small English letters only.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string t_{i}, then positive integer k_{i}, which equal to the number of times the string t_{i} occurs in string s, and then k_{i} distinct positive integers x_{i}, 1, x_{i}, 2, ..., x_{i}, k_{i} in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string t_{i} in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^6, 1 ≤ x_{i}, j ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 10^6, and the sum of all k_{i} doesn't exceed 10^6. The strings t_{i} can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers. 


-----Examples-----
Input
3
a 4 1 3 5 7
ab 2 1 5
ca 1 4

Output
abacaba

Input
1
a 1 3

Output
aaa

Input
3
ab 1 1
aba 1 3
ab 2 3 5

Output
ababab

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

" the output was "abaaaaa

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are two bugs in the provided code.

#### Bug 1:
The first bug is in the loop `for i in range(len(result), max_position)`. The loop should iterate until `max_position + 1` because the indexing in Python is zero-based. This means that if `max_position` is 7, we need to iterate 8 times in order to include the character at position 7.

#### Bug 2:
The second bug is in the logic for appending characters to the `result` list. The code checks if the current character in the string `t` is equal to the character at the same index in the `result` list. If they are equal, it continues to the next character. However, if they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop. This logic is incorrect because it only compares characters at the same index, but it does not take into account the positions where the string `t` occurs. This means that the code can potentially skip some characters that should be included in the `result` list.

To fix this, we need to compare characters at the positions specified in `positions` list for each string `t`. If the character at the specified position matches the current character in the `result` list, we can continue to the next character. If it doesn't match or the position is greater than the length of the `result` list, we need to append the character to the `result` list.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's analyze the bug in the code and fix it.

### ANALYSIS

There is a bug in the provided code.

#### Bug:
The code checks if the input integer `w` is odd or equal to 2. If it satisfies either of these conditions, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". However, this logic is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if `w` is divisible evenly by 2. If it is, we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's analyze the bug in the code and fix it.

### ANALYSIS

There is only one bug in the provided code.

#### Bug:
The code checks if the input integer `w` is odd or equal to 2. If it satisfies either of these conditions, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". However, this logic is incorrect.

The bug is that the condition should check if `w` is divisible evenly by 2 (i.e., if `w % 2 == 0`). If it is, it means that `w` is an even number and we should print "YES". Otherwise, we should print "NO".

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to correctly determine whether `w` is even or odd. We can do this by checking if `w % 2 == 0`. If the remainder of `w` divided by 2 is 0, it means `w` is even and we should print "YES". Otherwise, `w` is odd and we should print "NO".

Certainly! Here's the corrected code:

```python
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
```

This code correctly checks if the input integer `w` is an even number. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
