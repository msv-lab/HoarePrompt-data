          "feedback": "## Feedback\n### Bug 1\nThe input is not being read correctly. The input is given as multiple lines, but the code is trying to read it using `input()` which only reads one line at a time. Instead, you need to use `sys.stdin.readline()` to read the input line by line. \n\n### Bug 2\nThe code is not calculating the correct area for the quadrilaterals. The formula being used to calculate the area is incorrect. The correct formula for calculating the area of a quadrilateral when the coordinates of the vertices are given is the Shoelace formula. The current formula being used in the code is not equivalent to the Shoelace formula.\n\n### Bug 3\nThe condition in the second loop is incorrect. The second loop should start from `i+2`, not `i+1`. This is because the first vertex of the quadrilateral is fixed and the second vertex should be at least 2 indices ahead of the first vertex. \n\n### Bug 4\nThe last loop should start from `i+3`, not `i+1`. This is because the last vertex of the quadrilateral should be at least 3 indices ahead of the first vertex. \n\n### Bug 5\nThe output format is incorrect. The code prints the result as a float with a fixed number of decimals, but the expected output is a float with up to 9 decimal places. You need to format the output using the `format()` function to ensure the correct number of decimal places are displayed.",
