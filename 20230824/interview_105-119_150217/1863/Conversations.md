I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The Bitlandians are quite weird people. They have very peculiar customs.

As is customary, Uncle J. wants to have n eggs painted for Bitruz (an ancient Bitland festival). He has asked G. and A. to do the work.

The kids are excited because just as is customary, they're going to be paid for the job! 

Overall uncle J. has got n eggs. G. named his price for painting each egg. Similarly, A. named his price for painting each egg. It turns out that for each egg the sum of the money both A. and G. want for the painting equals 1000.

Uncle J. wants to distribute the eggs between the children so as to give each egg to exactly one child. Also, Uncle J. wants the total money paid to A. to be different from the total money paid to G. by no more than 500.

Help Uncle J. Find the required distribution of eggs or otherwise say that distributing the eggs in the required manner is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of eggs.

Next n lines contain two integers a_{i} and g_{i} each (0 ≤ a_{i}, g_{i} ≤ 1000; a_{i} + g_{i} = 1000): a_{i} is the price said by A. for the i-th egg and g_{i} is the price said by G. for the i-th egg.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to assign the painting, print "-1" (without quotes).

Otherwise print a string, consisting of n letters "G" and "A". The i-th letter of this string should represent the child who will get the i-th egg in the required distribution. Letter "A" represents A. and letter "G" represents G. If we denote the money Uncle J. must pay A. for the painting as S_{a}, and the money Uncle J. must pay G. for the painting as S_{g}, then this inequality must hold: |S_{a}  -  S_{g}|  ≤  500. 

If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 999
999 1

Output
AG

Input
3
400 600
400 600
400 600

Output

### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs and issues in the given code.

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The current logic for distributing the eggs is incorrect. The code checks if the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of prices said by A and G for the eggs distributed so far is less than or equal to 500. If it is, it assigns the egg to A, otherwise to G. This logic does not guarantee that the total money paid to A will be different from the total money paid to G by no more than 500. 

2. **Missing Increment in Egg Distribution**: After assigning an egg to either A or G, the code should increment the values of `a[i]` and `g[i]` to reflect that the egg has been distributed. However, the code is mistakenly set `a[i]` to 0 and `g[i]` to 1000 (or vice versa). This incorrect assignment will lead to incorrect distribution and will affect the final calculation of money paid to A and G.

3. **Incorrect Check for Distribution Possibility**: The code incorrectly checks if the absolute difference between the total money paid to A and the total money paid to G is less than or equal to 500. This check should only be made after all eggs have been distributed, not during the distribution loop. 

### BUGS
1. Incorrect distribution logic
2. Missing increment in egg distribution
3. Incorrect check for distribution possibility

### IMPACT
The bugs in the code will result in incorrect distribution of eggs and incorrect calculation of money paid to A and G. This will lead to incorrect results and may produce -1 as the output even when a valid distribution is possible.
