I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There always is something to choose from! And now, instead of "Noughts and Crosses", Inna choose a very unusual upgrade of this game. The rules of the game are given below:

There is one person playing the game. Before the beginning of the game he puts 12 cards in a row on the table. Each card contains a character: "X" or "O". Then the player chooses two positive integers a and b (a·b = 12), after that he makes a table of size a × b from the cards he put on the table as follows: the first b cards form the first row of the table, the second b cards form the second row of the table and so on, the last b cards form the last (number a) row of the table. The player wins if some column of the table contain characters "X" on all cards. Otherwise, the player loses.

Inna has already put 12 cards on the table in a row. But unfortunately, she doesn't know what numbers a and b to choose. Help her win the game: print to her all the possible ways of numbers a, b that she can choose and win.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). This value shows the number of sets of test data in the input. Next follows the description of each of the t tests on a separate line.

The description of each test is a string consisting of 12 characters, each character is either "X", or "O". The i-th character of the string shows the character that is written on the i-th card from the start.


-----Output-----

For each test, print the answer to the test on a single line. The first number in the line must represent the number of distinct ways to choose the pair a, b. Next, print on this line the pairs in the format axb. Print the pairs in the order of increasing first parameter (a). Separate the pairs in the line by whitespaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
OXXXOXOOXOOX
OXOXOXOXOXOX
XXXXXXXXXXXX
OOOOOOOOOOOO

Output
3 1x12 2x6 4x3
4 1x12 2x6 3x4 6x2
6 1x12 2x6 3x4 4x3 6x2 12x1
0
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code provided is almost correct, but there are a few bugs that are causing it to produce incorrect output. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. Incorrect condition for checking if a and b form a valid pair:
    - The code checks if `cards.count('X', 0, b) == b` to determine if the first row of the table contains all 'X' characters. However, this condition is incorrect because it only checks the first b cards, not the first row.
    - To fix this, the code should check if `cards[:b].count('X') == b` to verify if the first row contains all 'X' characters.

2. Missing check for the last row:
    - The code checks if the first row contains all 'X' characters, but it fails to check if the last row also contains all 'X' characters.
    - To fix this, the code should check if `cards[-b:].count('X') == b` to verify if the last row contains all 'X' characters.

3. Incorrect calculation of the number of possible pairs:
    - The code calculates the number of possible pairs as the length of the `possible_pairs` list. However, this is incorrect because it should only count the distinct pairs.
    - To fix this, the code should calculate the number of possible pairs as the length of a set created from `possible_pairs`. This will remove any duplicate pairs.

### BUGS
1. The condition `if cards.count('X', 0, b) == b` should be changed to `if cards[:b].count('X') == b` to check if the first row contains all 'X' characters.
2. The condition `cards.count('X', 0, b) == b` should be changed to `cards[-b:].count('X') == b` to check if the last row contains all 'X' characters.
3. The calculation of `num_possible_pairs` should be changed to `num_possible_pairs = len(set(possible_pairs))` to count the distinct pairs.

### IMPACT
The bugs in the code cause incorrect selection of valid pairs (a, b), leading to incorrect output. The code may either select invalid pairs or miss valid pairs, resulting in incorrect counts and pairs being printed. The bugs have a direct impact on the functionality of the program, making it unable to provide correct solutions for winning the game.

### PLAN
To fix the issues in the code, follow these steps:

1. Change the condition `if cards.count('X', 0, b) == b` to `if cards[:b].count('X') == b` on line 12.
2. Change the condition `cards.count('X', 0, b) == b` to `cards[-b:].count('X') == b` on line 15.
3. Change `num_possible_pairs = len(possible_pairs)` to `num_possible_pairs = len(set(possible_pairs))` on line 18.

Let's implement these changes in the code and test it again.

Sure! Here's the updated code:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    cards = input()

    num_x = cards.count('X')  # number of 'X' cards

    possible_pairs = []  # list to store all possible pairs (a, b)

    # iterate through all possible values of a and b
    for a in range(1, 13):
        if 12 % a == 0:
            b = 12 // a
            if cards[:b].count('X') == b and cards[-b:].count('X') == b:
                possible_pairs.append((a, b))

    num_possible_pairs = len(set(possible_pairs))

    print(num_possible_pairs, end=' ')
    for pair in possible_pairs:
        print(f"{pair[0]}x{pair[1]}", end=' ')
    print()
```

Please note that the code provided is your original code with the bugs fixed. The fix includes changing the conditions on lines 12 and 15, and the calculation of `num_possible_pairs` on line 18.
