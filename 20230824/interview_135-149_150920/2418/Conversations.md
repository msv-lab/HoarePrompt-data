I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

You have to construct two sequences of integers $b$ and $c$ with length $n$ that satisfy:  for every $i$ ($1\leq i\leq n$) $b_i+c_i=a_i$  $b$ is non-decreasing, which means that for every $1<i\leq n$, $b_i\geq b_{i-1}$ must hold  $c$ is non-increasing, which means that for every $1<i\leq n$, $c_i\leq c_{i-1}$ must hold 

You have to minimize $\max(b_i,c_i)$. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences $b$ and $c$.

Also there will be $q$ changes, the $i$-th change is described by three integers $l,r,x$. You should add $x$ to $a_l,a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$. 

You have to find the minimum possible value of $\max(b_i,c_i)$ for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 10^5$).

The secound line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1\leq i\leq n$, $-10^9\leq a_i\leq 10^9$).

The third line contains an integer $q$ ($1\leq q\leq 10^5$).

Each of the next $q$ lines contains three integers $l,r,x$ ($1\leq l\leq r\leq n,-10^9\leq x\leq 10^9$), desribing the next change. 


-----Output-----

Print $q+1$ lines.

On the $i$-th ($1 \leq i \leq q+1$) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after $i-1$ changes.


-----Examples-----
Input
4

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test:  The initial sequence $a = (2, -1, 7, 3)$. Two sequences $b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,-2)$ is a possible choice.  After the first change $a = (2, -4, 4, 0)$. Two sequences $b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,-1,-1,-5)$ is a possible choice.  After the second change $a = (2, -4, 6, 2)$. Two sequences $b=(-4,-4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,-4)$ is a possible choice.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
2 -1 7 3
2
2 4 -3
3 4 2
" the output was "-1
-4
-4
" but the expected output was "5
5
6
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are a couple of bugs in the provided code.

1. The first bug is in the `update_sequence` function. In the `for` loop, the indices should be from `l-1` to `r-1` instead of `l-1` to `r`. This is because the question states that the indices in the range $l$ to $r$ (inclusive) should be updated, and Python uses 0-based indexing.

2. The second bug is in the logic of the `min_max_value` function. Instead of finding the minimum value of the maximum of `b[i]` and `c[i]`, the code is finding the maximum value of `b[i]` and `c[i]`. This is incorrect and should be fixed by changing the `max_value = min(max_value, max(b[i], c[i]))` line to `max_value = min(max_value, max(b[i], c[i]))`.

3. The third bug is in the way the sequences `b` and `c` are initialized. The code uses `b = a.copy()` and `c = a.copy()` to initialize the sequences. However, if the input list `a` is updated after the initialization of `b` and `c`, the changes will not be reflected in `b` and `c`. To fix this, the sequences `b` and `c` should be initialized as empty lists, and the initial values of `a` should be appended to them.

### BUGS
1. The indices in the `update_sequence` function should start from `l-1` to `r-1`.
2. The `min_max_value` function is finding the maximum value of `b[i]` and `c[i]` instead of the minimum value.
3. The sequences `b` and `c` should be initialized as empty lists and the initial values of `a` should be appended to them.

### IMPACT
These bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:

1. The incorrect indices in the `update_sequence` function will cause the wrong elements to be updated. This will lead to incorrect values in the sequences `b` and `c` after the changes are applied.

2. The incorrect logic in the `min_max_value` function will cause the code to output the maximum value of `b[i]` and `c[i]` instead of the minimum value. This will result in incorrect minimum possible values of `max(b_i, c_i)` being printed.

3. The incorrect initialization of `b` and `c` will cause these sequences to not reflect changes made to `a` after the initialization. This will result in incorrect values for `b` and `c` after each change is applied.

### STRATEGY
To fix these bugs, we will make the following changes:

1. In the `update_sequence` function, we will change the `for` loop to iterate over the range `l-1` to `r`.

2. In the `min_max_value` function, we will change the line `max_value = min(max_value, max(b[i], c[i]))` to `max_value = min(max_value, min(b[i], c[i]))`.

3. We will initialize `b` and `c` as empty lists and append the initial values of `a` to them.
