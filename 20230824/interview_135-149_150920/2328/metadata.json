The median point calculation is not correct and is giving incorrect results. \n\n## Buggy code\nThe code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input \"3\n3 2\n1 2 5\n2 1\n1 1000000000\n1 0\n4\n\" the output was \"5\n1000000000\n4\n\" but the expected output was \"3\n500000000\n4\n\".\n\n## Solution\nThere are multiple ways to fix this issue but the simplest way is to use the 'kth' index of the list as the result instead of calculating the median point.",
