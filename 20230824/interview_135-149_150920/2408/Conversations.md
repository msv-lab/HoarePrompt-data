I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
This problem is same as the next one, but has smaller constraints.

It was a Sunday morning when the three friends Selena, Shiro and Katie decided to have a trip to the nearby power station (do not try this at home). After arriving at the power station, the cats got impressed with a large power transmission system consisting of many chimneys, electric poles, and wires. Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.

At the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.

Selena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage. So he wonders, how many pairs are intersecting? Could you help him with this problem?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — the number of electric poles.

Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($-10^4 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^4$) — the coordinates of the poles.

It is guaranteed that all of these $n$ points are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of pairs of wires that are intersecting.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0 0
1 1
0 3
1 2

Output
14

Input
4
0 0
0 2
0 4
2 0

Output
6

Input
3
-1 -1
1 0
3 1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example: [Image] 

In the second example: [Image] 

Note that the three poles $(0, 0)$, $(0, 2)$ and $(0, 4)$ are connected by a single wire.

In the third example: [Image]
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

  File "/var/folders/46/8ybh48tn40l32kbzy6n99p380000gn/T/tmp88wn3uue.py", line 35, in <module>

NameError: name 'intersect' is not defined
" but the expected output was "14
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the provided code:
1. The `intersect` function is defined after its usage. It should be defined before it is called in the main code.
2. The `intersect` function and the helper `orientation` and `on_segment` functions are not indented correctly. They should be indented to be inside the main code block.
3. The `intersect` function is missing the `def` keyword before its definition. It should be `def intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):`.
4. The `orientation` function is returning the wrong values for collinear, clockwise, and counter-clockwise orientations. It should return -1 for collinear, 1 for clockwise, and 0 for counter-clockwise.
5. The `on_segment` function is returning the wrong condition to check if a point lies on a line segment. It should check if `q[1] >= min(p[1], r[1])` instead of `q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1])`.

### BUGS
1. The `intersect` function is not defined before it is called in the main code. This results in a `NameError`.
2. The `intersect` function and the helper `orientation` and `on_segment` functions are not indented correctly. They should be indented to be inside the main code block.
3. The `intersect` function is missing the `def` keyword before its definition.
4. The `orientation` function is returning the wrong values for collinear, clockwise, and counter-clockwise orientations.
5. The `on_segment` function is returning the wrong condition to check if a point lies on a line segment.

    # Check if the line segments intersect
    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):
        return True
        
    # Special Cases
    # p1, q1 and p2 are collinear and p2 lies on the segment p1q1

I have fixed the bugs in the code. The changes I made are:

1. Moved the `intersect` function, `orientation` function, and `on_segment` function above their usage in the main code.
2. Indented the `intersect` function and the helper functions inside the main code block.
3. Added the `def` keyword before the definition of the `intersect` function.
4. Changed the return values in the `orientation` function: -1 for collinear, 1 for clockwise, and 0 for counter-clockwise.
5. Changed the condition in the `on_segment` function to check if `q[1] >= min(p[1], r[1])` instead of `q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1])`.

Please note that the `intersect` function and the helper functions are defined before their usage in the main code block now.
