The formula for f(x) is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of set x. \n\nThere are multiple issues in the code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The sorting of the array: After sorting the array in ascending order, the code incorrectly selects the maximum element using `A[i]` and the minimum element using `A[N-i-1]`. This logic is flawed because sorting the array changes the indices of the elements.\n\n2. The loop range: The loop should start from 0 instead of K-1 because the index i represents the number of elements chosen, not the index in the array.\n\n3. The calculation of the answer: The code uses `ans = (ans + A[i] - A[N-i-1]) % MOD` to calculate the sum of f(S). This approach will not yield correct results because it is choosing the maximum and minimum elements incorrectly.\n\n4. Incorrect modulus: The code uses `MOD = 10**9 + 7` to calculate the modulus, but it does not apply the modulus operation to the final answer. The modulus operation needs to be applied to `ans` before printing the result.\n\nTo fix these issues, I recommend making the following modifications to the code:\n\n1. Remove the line `A.sort()`.\n2. Modify the loop range from `range(K-1, N)` to `range(N)`.\n3. Inside the loop, calculate the maximum and minimum values using `max(A[i:i+K])` and `min(A[i:i+K])` respectively.\n4. Update the answer by adding the difference between the maximum and minimum values to `ans`.\n5. Apply the modulus operation `(ans + MOD) % MOD` to the final answer before printing.\n\nThe corrected code should look like this:",
