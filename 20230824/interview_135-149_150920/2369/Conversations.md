I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.
Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.
We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.
Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - |A_i| \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A_1 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer \bmod (10^9+7).

-----Sample Input-----
4 2
1 1 3 4

-----Sample Output-----
11

There are six ways to choose S: \{1,1\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\}, \{3,4\} (we distinguish the two 1s). The value of f(S) for these choices are 0,2,3,2,3,1, respectively, for the total of 11.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program.

" the output was "3

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
The code provided is for finding the sum of f(S) over all possible ways to choose K elements from a given list of N integers. The formula for f(x) is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of set x. 

There are multiple issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The sorting of the array: After sorting the array in ascending order, the code incorrectly selects the maximum element using `A[i]` and the minimum element using `A[N-i-1]`. This logic is flawed because sorting the array changes the indices of the elements.

2. The loop range: The loop should start from 0 instead of K-1 because the index i represents the number of elements chosen, not the index in the array.

3. The calculation of the answer: The code uses `ans = (ans + A[i] - A[N-i-1]) % MOD` to calculate the sum of f(S). This approach will not yield correct results because it is choosing the maximum and minimum elements incorrectly.

4. Incorrect modulus: The code uses `MOD = 10**9 + 7` to calculate the modulus, but it does not apply the modulus operation to the final answer. The modulus operation needs to be applied to `ans` before printing the result.

To fix these issues, I recommend making the following modifications to the code:

1. Remove the line `A.sort()`.
2. Modify the loop range from `range(K-1, N)` to `range(N)`.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the maximum and minimum values using `max(A[i:i+K])` and `min(A[i:i+K])` respectively.
4. Update the answer by adding the difference between the maximum and minimum values to `ans`.
5. Apply the modulus operation `(ans + MOD) % MOD` to the final answer before printing.

The corrected code should look like this:

I apologize for the oversight. There is one additional issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

5. Incorrect calculation of the answer: The code currently calculates the maximum and minimum values using `max(A[i:i+K])` and `min(A[i:i+K])` respectively within the loop. However, this approach is not correct because it selects the maximum and minimum values from overlapping subarrays.

To fix this issue, I recommend modifying the loop range from `range(N)` to `range(N-K+1)`. This ensures that the loop iterates over non-overlapping subarrays of size K. Then, inside the loop, calculate the maximum and minimum values using `max(A[i:i+K])` and `min(A[i:i+K])` respectively.

The corrected code should look like this:

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

MOD = 10**9 + 7

ans = 0
for i in range(N-K+1):
  # To choose K elements, we take the difference between the maximum and minimum
  # element of the chosen subarray.
  # f(S) = max(S) - min(S)
  # To calculate f(S) efficiently, we subtract the minimum element from the maximum element
  # of a sliding window of size K. We keep updating the answer with this difference.
  ans = (ans + max(A[i:i+K]) - min(A[i:i+K])) % MOD

print(ans)
```
