I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Vivek has encountered a problem. He has a maze that can be represented as an $n \times m$ grid. Each of the grid cells may represent the following:  Empty — '.'  Wall — '#'  Good person  — 'G'  Bad person — 'B' 

The only escape from the maze is at cell $(n, m)$.

A person can move to a cell only if it shares a side with their current cell and does not contain a wall. Vivek wants to block some of the empty cells by replacing them with walls in such a way, that all the good people are able to escape, while none of the bad people are able to. A cell that initially contains 'G' or 'B' cannot be blocked and can be travelled through.

Help him determine if there exists a way to replace some (zero or more) empty cells with walls to satisfy the above conditions.

It is guaranteed that the cell $(n,m)$ is empty. Vivek can also block this cell.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 100)$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ $(1 \le n, m \le 50)$ — the number of rows and columns in the maze.

Each of the next $n$ lines contain $m$ characters. They describe the layout of the maze. If a character on a line equals '.', the corresponding cell is empty. If it equals '#', the cell has a wall. 'G' corresponds to a good person and 'B' corresponds to a bad person.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "Yes" if there exists a way to replace some empty cells with walls to satisfy the given conditions. Otherwise print "No"

You may print every letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
6
1 1
.
1 2
G.
2 2
#B
G.
2 3
G.#
B#.
3 3
#B.
#..
GG.
2 2
#B
B.

Output
Yes
Yes
No
No
Yes
Yes



-----Note-----

For the first and second test cases, all conditions are already satisfied.

For the third test case, there is only one empty cell $(2,2)$, and if it is replaced with a wall then the good person at $(1,2)$ will not be able to escape.

For the fourth test case, the good person at $(1,1)$ cannot escape.

For the fifth test case, Vivek can block the cells $(2,3)$ and $(2,2)$.

For the last test case, Vivek can block the destination cell $(2, 2)$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
To solve this problem, the code checks each cell in the maze. If the cell contains a good person 'G', it checks if there is a bad person 'B' nearby. If there is, it sets the possible variable to False. The code does the same for cells containing a bad person 'B'. Finally, it prints "Yes" if possible is True, and "No" otherwise.

Upon examining the code, we can identify a few bugs and areas where the code can be improved:

1. The variable possible is being reused for each test case. This means that if a test case sets possible to False, it will remain False for subsequent test cases. To fix this, we need to reset possible to True before processing each test case.

2. The code does not handle the case where there are no good people or bad people in the maze. In such a case, the code should print "Yes", indicating that there is a way to replace some empty cells with walls to satisfy the conditions. This can be achieved by adding a check at the beginning of the code to see if there are any good people or bad people in the maze. If there are none, the code can print "Yes" and move on to the next test case.

3. The code checks for good people and bad people in adjacent cells by using if statements for each possible direction. However, this can be simplified by using a loop to check for adjacent cells. By iterating over a list of directions (up, down, left, right), we can check each adjacent cell using a single loop. This will make the code more concise and easier to understand.

4. Currently, the code checks if there is a bad person nearby when encountering a good person, and vice versa. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the good people can escape and the bad people cannot. We need to ensure that all the good people can reach the destination cell while none of the bad people can. To do this, we can modify the code to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the maze and check if all the good people can reach the destination cell. This will provide a more accurate solution to the problem.

### BUGS

1. The variable `possible` is not reset to `True` before processing each test case. This means that if a test case sets `possible` to `False`, it will remain `False` for subsequent test cases.

2. The code does not handle the case where there are no good people or bad people in the maze. In such a case, the code should print "Yes", indicating that there is a way to replace some empty cells with walls to satisfy the conditions.

3. The code checks if a good person can reach the destination cell, but it does not check if all the good people can reach the destination cell. Similarly, it checks if a bad person can reach the destination cell, but it does not check if none of the bad people can reach the destination cell. This means that the code does not provide an accurate solution to the problem.

### IMPROVEMENTS

1. Reset the `possible` variable to `True` before processing each test case.

2. Add a check at the beginning of the code to see if there are any good people or bad people in the maze. If there are none, print "Yes" and move on to the next test case.

3. Simplify the code by using a loop to check for adjacent cells. Iterate over a list of directions (up, down, left, right) and check each adjacent cell using a single loop.

4. Modify the code to use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the maze and check if all the good people can reach the destination cell, while none of the bad people can. This will provide a more accurate solution to the problem.
