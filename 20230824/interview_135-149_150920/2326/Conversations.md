I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ is called a good array if $a_1 = k - 1$ and $a_1 > 0$. For example, the sequences $[3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99]$ are good arrays, and the sequences $[3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0]$ — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences $[2, -3, 0, 1, 4]$, $[1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4]$ are good, and the sequences $[2, -3, 0, 1]$, $[1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1]$ — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the number $n~(1 \le n \le 10^3)$ — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n~(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the sequence itself.


-----Output-----

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
2 1 1

Output
2

Input
4
1 1 1 1

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first test case, two good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3]$ and $[a_2, a_3]$.

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4]$ and $[a_3, a_4]$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

### QUESTION
The sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ is called a good array if $a_1 = k - 1$ and $a_1 > 0$. For example, the sequences $[3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99]$ are good arrays, and the sequences $[3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0]$ — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences $[2, -3, 0, 1, 4]$, $[1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4]$ are good, and the sequences $[2, -3, 0, 1]$, $[1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1]$ — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the number $n~(1 \le n \le 10^3)$ — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n~(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the sequence itself.


-----Output-----

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
2 1 1

Output
2

Input
4
1 1 1 1

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first test case, two good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3]$ and $[a_2, a_3]$.

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4]$ and $[a_3, a_4]$.
### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

def count_good_subsequences(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    dp = [0] * (n+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i-1] > a[j] or a[i-1] == -1:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n]

result = count_good_subsequences(n, a)
print(result)
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
2 1 1
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Review
1. The input is not being read correctly. The first line is the length of the sequence, so the code needs to read `n` before the second line.
2. The condition in the inner loop is incorrect. It should be checking if `a[i-1] > a[j]` or `a[i-1] == -1`, not `a[i-1] > a[j]` or `a[i-1] == -1`.
3. The initial value of `dp[0]` is incorrect. It should be `dp[0] = 0` in order to correctly initialize the array.
4. The indices in the loops are incorrect. The outer loop should iterate from 1 to `n`, while the inner loop should iterate from `i-2` to -1. This is because we want to compare the current element `a[i-1]` with the previous elements `a[j]` where `j` is less than `i-1`.
5. The final answer should be `dp[n] - 1` instead of `dp[n]`.

These bugs impact the program's functionality by producing incorrect results for the number of good subsequences. The incorrect initial value of `dp[0]` causes the program to count 1 additional subsequence in all cases. The incorrect condition in the inner loop prevents the program from correctly counting the number of subsequences that are good.
