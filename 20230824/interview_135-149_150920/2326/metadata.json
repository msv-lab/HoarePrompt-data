          "feedback": "## Review\n1. The input is not being read correctly. The first line is the length of the sequence, so the code needs to read `n` before the second line.\n2. The condition in the inner loop is incorrect. It should be checking if `a[i-1] > a[j]` or `a[i-1] == -1`, not `a[i-1] > a[j]` or `a[i-1] == -1`.\n3. The initial value of `dp[0]` is incorrect. It should be `dp[0] = 0` in order to correctly initialize the array.\n4. The indices in the loops are incorrect. The outer loop should iterate from 1 to `n`, while the inner loop should iterate from `i-2` to -1. This is because we want to compare the current element `a[i-1]` with the previous elements `a[j]` where `j` is less than `i-1`.\n5. The final answer should be `dp[n] - 1` instead of `dp[n]`.\n\nThese bugs impact the program's functionality by producing incorrect results for the number of good subsequences. The incorrect initial value of `dp[0]` causes the program to count 1 additional subsequence in all cases. The incorrect condition in the inner loop prevents the program from correctly counting the number of subsequences that are good.",
