I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given a tree with N vertices and N-1 edges. The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge connects Vertex a_i and b_i.
You have coloring materials of K colors.
For each vertex in the tree, you will choose one of the K colors to paint it, so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - If the distance between two different vertices x and y is less than or equal to two, x and y have different colors.
How many ways are there to paint the tree? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.
What is tree?
A tree is a kind of graph. For detail, please see: Wikipedia "Tree (graph theory)"

What is distance?
The distance between two vertices x and y is the minimum number of edges one has to traverse to get from x to y.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,K \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq a_i,b_i \leq N
 - The given graph is a tree.

-----Input-----

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
1 2

There are six ways to paint the tree.
### Requirements

Sure!

Here's the complete solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(node, parent, adj_list, color_options):
    total_ways = 1
    num_colors = len(color_options[node])
    
    # Remove the parent's color option from the current node
    if parent != 0:
        num_colors -= 1
    
    for child in adj_list[node]:
        if child == parent:
            continue
            
        total_ways *= (num_colors % MOD)
        total_ways %= MOD
        
        num_colors -= 1
        
        total_ways *= dfs(child, node, adj_list, color_options)
        total_ways %= MOD
        
    return total_ways

MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Read input
N, K = map(int, input().split())
adj_list = defaultdict(list)

# Build adjacency list and initialize color options
for _ in range(N-1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    adj_list[a].append(b)
    adj_list[b].append(a)

# Initialize color options
color_options = defaultdict(set)
for i in range(1, N+1):
    color_options[i] = set(range(1, K+1))

# Calculate number of ways to paint the tree
num_ways = dfs(1, 0, adj_list, color_options)

# Print result
print(num_ways)
```

In this solution, we define a function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search to calculate the number of ways to paint the tree. The function takes in the current node, its parent, the adjacency list, and the color options for each node.

We start the search at the root node (1) and iterate through its children. For each child, we multiply the total number of ways by the number of available colors (excluding the color of the parent node), and recursively call the `dfs` function on the child node. This ensures that each call to `dfs` considers one level deeper in the tree.

In the main part of the code, we read the input, build the adjacency list, and initialize the color options for each node. We then call the `dfs` function on the root node, passing in the adjacency list and color options. Finally, we print the result.

The code handles the given constraints and uses a modular arithmetic to avoid overflow when calculating the number of ways.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Feedback
There are a few bugs in the provided code that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through them one by one:

1. Modulo Error: The value of `MOD` is incorrect. It should be `10**9 + 7`, but it is currently `10**9 + 7`. 

2. Color Options Calculation Error: The `color_options` dictionary should be initialized with all color options for each node. However, the current code initializes it with an empty set of color options for each node. This will cause errors in the later calculations.

3. Incorrect Calculation of Number of Colors: The calculation of `num_colors` in the `dfs` function is incorrect. The code subtracts 1 from `num_colors` if the node has a parent. However, this should actually be subtracting the number of colors used by the parent node.

4. Incorrect Modulo Operation: The `total_ways` variable is being multiplied with the number of colors and then modulo operation is being performed. However, it should be the other way around. First, perform the modulo operation and then multiply `total_ways` with the number of colors.

5. Incorrect Recursion: The code does not handle the base case correctly. It assumes that the root node will always have a parent with color, hence it subtracts 1 from `num_colors` in the case where `parent != 0`. However, this is not always true. The root node may not have any parent or color. This base case needs to be handled separately.

6. Incorrect Function Call: The `dfs` function is called with `1` as the value of `node` and `0` as the value of `parent`. However, the input specifies that the vertices are numbered from `1` to `N`, so there should be no vertex with value `0` as its parent.

7. Missing Recursive Call: The `dfs` function should also make a recursive call for the parent node. This ensures that the colors used by the parent node are also taken into account.

These are the bugs in the provided code. Fixing them should give you the correct output.

Apologies for providing incorrect feedback. Here's the corrected code:

    num_colors = len(color_options[node])
    
    # Remove the parent's color option from the current node
