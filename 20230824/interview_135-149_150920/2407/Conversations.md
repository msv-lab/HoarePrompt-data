I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Ivan plays an old action game called Heretic. He's stuck on one of the final levels of this game, so he needs some help with killing the monsters.

The main part of the level is a large corridor (so large and narrow that it can be represented as an infinite coordinate line). The corridor is divided into two parts; let's assume that the point $x = 0$ is where these parts meet.

The right part of the corridor is filled with $n$ monsters — for each monster, its initial coordinate $x_i$ is given (and since all monsters are in the right part, every $x_i$ is positive).

The left part of the corridor is filled with crusher traps. If some monster enters the left part of the corridor or the origin (so, its current coordinate becomes less than or equal to $0$), it gets instantly killed by a trap.

The main weapon Ivan uses to kill the monsters is the Phoenix Rod. It can launch a missile that explodes upon impact, obliterating every monster caught in the explosion and throwing all other monsters away from the epicenter. Formally, suppose that Ivan launches a missile so that it explodes in the point $c$. Then every monster is either killed by explosion or pushed away. Let some monster's current coordinate be $y$, then:

  if $c = y$, then the monster is killed;  if $y < c$, then the monster is pushed $r$ units to the left, so its current coordinate becomes $y - r$;  if $y > c$, then the monster is pushed $r$ units to the right, so its current coordinate becomes $y + r$. 

Ivan is going to kill the monsters as follows: choose some integer point $d$ and launch a missile into that point, then wait until it explodes and all the monsters which are pushed to the left part of the corridor are killed by crusher traps, then, if at least one monster is still alive, choose another integer point (probably the one that was already used) and launch a missile there, and so on.

What is the minimum number of missiles Ivan has to launch in order to kill all of the monsters? You may assume that every time Ivan fires the Phoenix Rod, he chooses the impact point optimally.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \le n, r \le 10^5$) — the number of enemies and the distance that the enemies are thrown away from the epicenter of the explosion.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $x_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^5$) — the initial positions of the monsters.

It is guaranteed that sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer — the minimum number of shots from the Phoenix Rod required to kill all monsters.


-----Example-----
Input
2
3 2
1 3 5
4 1
5 2 3 5

Output
2
2



-----Note-----

In the first test case, Ivan acts as follows:   choose the point $3$, the first monster dies from a crusher trap at the point $-1$, the second monster dies from the explosion, the third monster is pushed to the point $7$;  choose the point $7$, the third monster dies from the explosion. 

In the second test case, Ivan acts as follows:   choose the point $5$, the first and fourth monsters die from the explosion, the second monster is pushed to the point $1$, the third monster is pushed to the point $2$;  choose the point $2$, the first monster dies from a crusher trap at the point $0$, the second monster dies from the explosion.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2
3 2
1 3 5
4 1
5 2 3 5
" the output was "1
1
" but the expected output was "2
2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code provided is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over the sorted positions of the monsters in descending order. For each position, it checks if it is less than or equal to the maximum position encountered so far. If it is, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it increments the shots counter.

However, there are a few bugs in the code that are causing it to produce incorrect results.

### BUG 1: Incorrect variable assignment
```python
max_pos = positions[-1]
```
The code is initializing `max_pos` with the last element of the `positions` list, assuming that it is the maximum position. However, it fails to consider that the list might contain duplicate values. In such cases, the actual maximum position can be different.

### BUG 2: Incorrect condition for breaking the loop
```python
if positions[i] <= max_pos:
    break
```
The code checks if the current position is less than or equal to `max_pos` to determine whether to break the loop. However, this condition is incorrect because it assumes that all monsters with positions greater than `max_pos` have been pushed to the left part of the corridor and have been killed by the crusher traps. In reality, there might be monsters with positions greater than `max_pos` that are still alive because they were not pushed far enough to be killed.

### IMPACT
These bugs cause the code to underestimate the minimum number of shots needed to kill all the monsters. As a result, the code produces incorrect output and fails to solve the problem correctly.

### SUGGESTED FIXES
Bug 1: Modify the way `max_pos` is calculated to account for the possibility of duplicate positions.
Bug 2: Change the condition for breaking the loop to ensure that all monsters greater than `max_pos` have been pushed far enough to the right to guarantee their death.

Note: The suggested fixes are not provided in the previous paragraphs, but they should be implemented by making these mentioned changes.

### RECOMMENDATION
The code needs to be modified to fix the bugs and correctly solve the problem.
