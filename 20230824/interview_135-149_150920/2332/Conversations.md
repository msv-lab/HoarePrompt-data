I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
Mahmoud wants to send a message to his friend Ehab. Their language consists of n words numbered from 1 to n. Some words have the same meaning so there are k groups of words such that all the words in some group have the same meaning.

Mahmoud knows that the i-th word can be sent with cost a_{i}. For each word in his message, Mahmoud can either replace it with another word of the same meaning or leave it as it is. Can you help Mahmoud determine the minimum cost of sending the message?

The cost of sending the message is the sum of the costs of sending every word in it.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains integers n, k and m (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of words in their language, the number of groups of words, and the number of words in Mahmoud's message respectively.

The second line contains n strings consisting of lowercase English letters of length not exceeding 20 which represent the words. It's guaranteed that the words are distinct.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) where a_{i} is the cost of sending the i-th word.

The next k lines describe the groups of words of same meaning. The next k lines each start with an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) which means that there are x words in this group, followed by x integers which represent the indices of words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one group.

The next line contains m space-separated words which represent Mahmoud's message. Each of these words appears in the list of language's words.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain the minimum cost to send the message after replacing some words (maybe none) with some words of the same meaning.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 4 4
i loser am the second
100 1 1 5 10
1 1
1 3
2 2 5
1 4
i am the second

Output
107
Input
5 4 4
i loser am the second
100 20 1 5 10
1 1
1 3
2 2 5
1 4
i am the second

Output
116


-----Note-----

In the first sample, Mahmoud should replace the word "second" with the word "loser" because it has less cost so the cost will be 100+1+5+1=107.

In the second sample, Mahmoud shouldn't do any replacement so the cost will be 100+1+5+10=116.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

This code attempts to find the minimum cost of sending a message by replacing words with others of the same meaning. However, there are several bugs in the code that need to be addressed.

1. The code doesn't handle inputs correctly.
2. The code doesn't correctly build the index of words.
3. The code doesn't correctly calculate the minimum cost.

Let's discuss each bug in detail.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect input handling
There is an issue with how the input is parsed and assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. Currently, the code expects the input to be space-separated integers, but the example input is newline-separated. This causes the variable assignments to fail, leading to incorrect values for `n`, `k`, and `m`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly parse the input. We should split the input by newlines and then split each line by spaces to extract the integers.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect word index building
The code attempts to build an index of words using a dictionary `word_indices`. However, the index is built based on the order of appearance of the words, which is incorrect. The index should be built based on the word itself, not its position in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to use the word as the key in the `word_indices` dictionary instead of the word's position.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect calculation of the minimum cost
The code incorrectly calculates the minimum cost by iterating over each word in the message and checking if it is in any group. If a word is in a group, the code checks if there is a cheaper word in the group to replace the current word. If a cheaper word is found, the code subtracts the cost of the current word and adds the cost of the cheaper word to the minimum cost.

However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that there is at most one cheaper word in the group. It doesn't consider the possibility of multiple cheaper words in the group. Additionally, the code fails to handle the case where a word is not in any group.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly calculate the minimum cost. Instead of iterating over each word in the message, we should iterate over each group and check if the current word is in the group. If it is in the group, we should find the cheapest word in the group and replace the current word's cost with the cheapest word's cost. Finally, we should sum up the costs of all the words in the message to obtain the minimum cost.

Let's work on the solution to fix all the bugs one by one.
