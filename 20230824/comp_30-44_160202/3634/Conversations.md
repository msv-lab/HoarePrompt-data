I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
In the cold and remote areas of northern Sweden, a young boy named Anton lives. Being born to a family of pistvakts (an occupation that involves drinking moonshine called “bäverhojt”, hunting bears and occasionally handling safety in the mountains), he has been handed the responsibility of mounting temperature sensors in the Scandinavian Mountains. Anton has to place three identical sensors along the mountain range, which can be modeled as a one-dimensional number line.

A lot of snow fell during the winter, and the sensors need to be placed at points with an ascending order of snow levels, since they work best arranged that way. This means that at the point of the leftmost sensor, the snow level must be strictly less than that of the other sensors, and at the point of the rightmost sensor, the snow level must instead be the strictly higher than that of the other sensors. Anton may also only place sensors at integer points. His house is located at point $0$, and no sensor may be placed to the left of the house.

Even with this limitation, there can be a huge number of ways in which he can place the sensors. Anton has saved the log of where snow has fallen during the winter, given as a number of ranges $[a, b]$, indicating that 1 meter of snow fell between and including points $a$ and $b$. If snow fell $k$ times over a certain point, the snow level in that point is $k$. Can you help him calculate the number of ways he may place the sensors?

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains a number $0 \le n \le 10^5$, the number of entries Anton has in his snow log. Then follow $n$ lines, each containing the two numbers $0 \le a \le b \le 10^{18}$, denoting an interval in which snow fell.

-----Output-----
Output consists of a single integer – the number of ways in which Anton can place the sensors. This number may be large, so output the remainder modulo $1000000009$. If there is no way Anton can place the sensors, you should instead output the string “shovel time!”, since Anton then must take his snowmobile and manually construct three points with the sought property.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3
1 1
2 3
2 3
Sample Output:
2
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Review

The code has a few bugs that need to be addressed. Here are the main issues I found:

1. Incorrect calculation of the snow level in the range: The code does not correctly calculate the snow level in each range. Instead, it calculates the range size as the difference between the upper and lower limits of the range. This is incorrect because the number of snowfalls in a range does not necessarily correspond to the range size. The snow level in each range should be calculated based on the number of snowfalls in that range.

2. Incorrect initialization of the left_count and right_count arrays: The code initializes the left_count and right_count arrays with zeros. However, these arrays should be initialized with ones since they are used to calculate the number of ways Anton can place the sensors.

3. Incorrect calculation of the count: The code incorrectly calculates the count by multiplying the left_count and right_count values and then adding them to the count. This calculation should be done modulo 1000000009 after each multiplication.

4. Incorrect condition for shovel time: The code checks if the count is equal to zero to determine if Anton needs to manually construct three points. However, the correct condition should be if the count is greater than or equal to 3, since Anton needs to place three sensors.

5. Poor variable naming: The code uses variable names like n, a, b, and ranges, which do not convey their purpose. It would be better to use more descriptive names to improve code readability.

I will now go through the code and point out the errors in more detail.

We have identified several issues in the code:

1. The calculation of the snow level in each range is incorrect. The code calculates the range size as the difference between the upper and lower limits of the range. However, the snow level should be based on the number of snowfalls in that range. To fix this, we need to calculate the snow level for each range by subtracting the lower limit of the range from the upper limit of the range, and then adding 1.

2. The initialization of the `left_count` and `right_count` arrays is incorrect. The code initializes them with zeros, but they should be initialized with ones since they are used to calculate the number of ways Anton can place the sensors. To fix this, we need to change the initialization of both arrays to `left_count = [1] * (n+1)` and `right_count = [1] * (n+1)`.

3. The calculation of the count is incorrect. The code multiplies the `left_count` and `right_count` values and then adds them to the count. However, to calculate the count correctly, we need to multiply the `left_count` and `right_count` values modulo 1000000009 after each multiplication. To fix this, we need to change the calculation of the count to `count += (left_count[i] * right_count[i+1]) % 1000000009`.

4. The condition for shovel time is incorrect. The code checks if the count is equal to zero to determine if Anton needs to manually construct three points. However, the correct condition should be if the count is greater than or equal to 3, since Anton needs to place three sensors. To fix this, we need to change the condition for shovel time to `if count < 3`.

5. The variable names `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ranges` are not descriptive and make the code harder to understand. It would be better to use more descriptive names. To fix this, we need to change the variable names to something more meaningful.

Let's implement these fixes in the code.

Sure! Here is the fixed code with the implemented fixes:

```python
n = int(input())
snow_ranges = []
for i in range(n):
    lower_limit, upper_limit = map(int, input().split())
    snow_ranges.append((lower_limit, upper_limit))

snow_ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
left_count = [1] * (n+1)
right_count = [1] * (n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):
    snow_level = snow_ranges[i-1][1] - snow_ranges[i-1][0] + 1
    left_count[i] = (left_count[i-1] * snow_level) % 1000000009

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    snow_level = snow_ranges[i][1] - snow_ranges[i][0] + 1
    right_count[i] = (right_count[i+1] * snow_level) % 1000000009

count = 0
for i in range(n):
    count += (left_count[i] * right_count[i+1]) % 1000000009
    count %= 1000000009

if count < 3:
    print("shovel time!")
else:
    print(count)
```

Now the code should correctly calculate the number of ways Anton can place the sensors and provide the correct output.
