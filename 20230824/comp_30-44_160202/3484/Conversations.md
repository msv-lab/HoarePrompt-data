I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Alice and Bob are big fans of math. In particular, they are very excited about playing games that are related to numbers. Whenever they see a puzzle like Sudoku, they cannot stop themselves from solving it. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a $9\times 9$ grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine ($3\times 3$) subgrids that compose the grid (also called “boxes”, “blocks”, or “regions”) contains all of the digits from $1$ to $9$. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

After many years of solving Sudoku problems, Alice and Bob are tired of Sudoku. They have been trying to develop a harder variation of Sudoku, which they are calling Superdoku. In Superdoku, the grid is bigger – $n\times n$ instead of just $9\times 9$. However, the “block” constraints are impossible to formulate when there are no further constraints on $n$. Therefore, there are no block constraints in Superdoku. Instead, the goal is simply to make sure that each column and each row in the grid contains all of the integers from $1$ to $n$. After playing for a while in the standard way (where any of the grid cells may have previously been filled in), they decide that the game is too difficult and they want to simplify it. Therefore, they decide to make the initial grid further constrained. They constrain the board by filling in the first $k$ rows completely.

Alice and Bob both believe that Superdoku is solvable. However, since $n$ could be very big, it may still take a long time to figure out a solution. They don’t want to spend too much time on this single game, so they are asking for your help!

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single test case. The first line lists two space-separated integers $1 \le n \le 100$ and $0 \le k \le n$, denoting the size of the grid $(n\times n)$ and the number of rows $k$ that are already filled in. Each of the following $k$ lines contains $n$ space-separated integers, denoting the first $k$ given rows. All integers in these $k$ lines are between $1$ and $n$.

-----Output-----
Output either “yes” or “no” on the first line, indicating if there is a solution. If there is no solution, do not output anything more. If there is a solution, output $n$ more lines, each containing $n$ space-separated integers, representing a solution. If there are multiple solutions, output any one of them.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4 2
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 1
Sample Output:
yes
1 2 3 4 
2 3 4 1 
3 4 1 2 
4 1 2 3
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several issues with the given code:

1. The code does not handle the case when $k = 0$. This means that the initial grid is empty, and in this case, the code will throw an error when trying to access `grid[i]` in the following lines of code. We need to add a condition to check if `k` is 0 and handle it separately.

2. The code assumes that the input rows are filled in from top to bottom. However, the input rows can be in any order. This means that the code cannot rely on the first `k` rows being in order. We need to modify the code to handle this case.

3. The code does not correctly check if each column contains all integers from 1 to `n`. The current implementation only checks if the length of the set of numbers in each row is equal to `n`. However, this does not guarantee that each column contains all numbers from 1 to `n`. We need to modify the code to check if each column contains all numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. The code has an error in the loop that fills in the missing numbers. The loop should iterate from `k` to `n-1`, but the code incorrectly iterates from `k` to `n`. This causes the error `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### BUG FIXES

To fix the issues mentioned above, we need to make the following changes to the code:

1. Handle the case when `k = 0` separately. If `k = 0`, we can directly print "yes" and the solution grid will be a grid filled with numbers in increasing order from 1 to `n`. We can add the following condition at the beginning of the code:

```python
if k == 0:
    print("yes")
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(n):
            row.append(j+1)
        print(*row)
    exit()
```

2. Remove the assumption that the input rows are filled in from top to bottom. Instead of using `grid.append(row)` to add rows to the `grid` list, we can use `grid[i] = row` to directly fill the rows at the correct index. We need to replace the following line:

```python
grid.append(row)
```

with:

```python
grid[i] = row
```

3. Modify the code to correctly check if each column contains all integers from 1 to `n`. We can do this by creating a list `col_numbers_check` that contains sets of numbers for each column. After filling in the `grid` with the given rows, we can iterate over the columns and check if each column contains all numbers from 1 to `n`. If any column is missing a number, we can print "no" and exit. We can add the following code after filling in the `grid`:

```python
col_numbers_check = [set() for _ in range(n)]
for j in range(n):
    for i in range(k):
        col_numbers_check[j].add(grid[i][j])
for j in range(n):
    if len(col_numbers_check[j]) < n:
        print("no")
        exit()
```

4. Change the loop that fills in the missing numbers to iterate from `k` to `n-1` instead of `k` to `n`. We can modify the following line:

```python
for i in range(k, n):
```

to:

```python
for i in range(k, n-1):
```
