I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Once, two trees forgot their place and started to grow into each other. One of the trees grew from the left, and the other from the right. On $n$ points, they collided.

Numbering the points $1, 2, \dots , n$ from left to right, the left tree ended up connecting all of them in a single subtree rooted in node $1$, such that every node’s children had larger numbers than the node itself. We can describe this subtree with a list of $n-1$ edges.

Similarly, the right tree also connected all nodes in a single subtree rooted in node $n$, with every node’s children having smaller numbers than the node itself. This yields an additional $n-1$ edges.

Now, given the full list of $2(n-1)$ edges, it is not necessarily easy to tell which edge belongs to which tree. Can you figure out a possible assignment, or determine that it is impossible for this collection to have been the union of two trees?

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$). The next $2(n-1)$ lines each contain two integers $u, v$ ($1 \le u < v \le n$) indicating an edge joining the two nodes $u$ and $v$. A pair $(u, v)$ may be connected by more than one edge.

-----Output-----
If it is possible for the edges to be the union of two trees that grow left-to-right and right-to-left, output a string of length $2(n-1)$, where the $i$’s character is L if the $i$’th edge should come from the left tree, or R if it should come from the right tree. Otherwise, output the word “impossible” on a single line. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

-----Explanation of Sample Inputs-----
In the first example, there are two solutions: LLRRRRLL and LLRLRRLR.

In the second example, there are no solutions. Note that LRLR is not valid, because it would involve the right tree growing backward, from left to right.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
5
1 2
2 5
2 3
1 3
3 5
4 5
3 4
1 3
Sample Output:
LLRRRRLL
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "LLLRRLRR
" but the expected output was "LLRRRRLL
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

Upon reviewing the code, I have identified several bugs:

1. In the `assign_edges` function, when checking if an edge is already assigned to either the left or right tree, the conditions `(u, v) in left_edges or (v, u) in left_edges` and `(u, v) in right_edges or (v, u) in right_edges` are incorrect. The correct conditions should be `(u, v) in left_edges or (v, u) in left_edges or (v, u) in right_edges` and `(u, v) in right_edges or (v, u) in right_edges or (u, v) in left_edges`.

2. In the `assign_edges` function, when assigning "L" or "R" to the edges, the loop should iterate through `left_edges` instead of `edges`.

3. In the `assign_edges` function, the check for a cycle when adding an edge to the left tree is incorrect. The condition `if has_cycle(left_edges + [(u, v)]):` should be changed to `if has_cycle(left_edges + [(u, v)]) or has_cycle(right_edges + [(u, v)]):`, as adding the edge to either the left or right tree can potentially create a cycle.

4. In the `assign_edges` function, the assignment of "L" or "R" to the edges is incorrect. The line `if edge in left_edges or edge[::-1] in left_edges:` should be changed to `if edge in left_edges or edge[::-1] in right_edges:`.

5. In the `assign_edges` function, the final assignment string is not being updated correctly. Instead of `assignment += "L"` and `assignment += "R"`, it should be `assignment += "L"` and `assignment += "R"`.

6. In the `has_cycle` function, the condition `if neighbor in visited or dfs(neighbor, node, visited, graph):` is incorrect. It should be `if neighbor in visited and neighbor != parent or dfs(neighbor, node, visited, graph):`, as the current condition allows for self-loops.

### Impact on functionality

These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program:

1. The incorrect conditions for checking if an edge is already assigned to a tree may result in incorrect assignments, leading to an invalid solution.

2. The incorrect assignment of "L" or "R" to the edges may result in an incorrect final assignment string.

3. The incorrect check for a cycle when adding an edge to the left tree may result in an invalid solution.

4. The incorrect condition in the `has_cycle` function may result in falsely identifying a cycle or not identifying a cycle when there is one, leading to an incorrect solution.

Overall, these bugs result in incorrect output and may prevent the program from correctly determining if the edges can be the union of two trees or not.

### Suggestions for improvement

Here are my suggestions for fixing the bugs in the code:

1. In the `assign_edges` function, update the conditions for checking if an edge is already assigned to a tree to `(u, v) in left_edges or (v, u) in left_edges or (v, u) in right_edges` and `(u, v) in right_edges or (v, u) in right_edges or (u, v) in left_edges`.

2. In the `assign_edges` function, change the loop to iterate through `left_edges` instead of `edges` when assigning "L" or "R" to the edges.

3. In the `assign_edges` function, update the condition for checking if adding an edge to the left tree creates a cycle to `if has_cycle(left_edges + [(u, v)]) or has_cycle(right_edges + [(u, v)])`.

4. In the `assign_edges` function, update the assignment of "L" or "R" to the edges to `if edge in left_edges or edge[::-1] in right_edges:`.

5. In the `assign_edges` function, update the assignment of "L" or "R" to the final assignment string to `assignment += "L"` and `assignment += "R"`.

6. In the `has_cycle` function, update the condition to `if neighbor in visited and neighbor != parent or dfs(neighbor, node, visited, graph):`.

By making these changes, the code should be able to correctly assign the edges to the left and right trees and determine if the edges can be the union of two trees.
