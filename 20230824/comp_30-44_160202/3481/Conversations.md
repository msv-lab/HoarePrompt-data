I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Doug James is an up-and-coming DJ from Graphland who’s had a tough time making it big. This all changed with the release of his latest EP Wiggly Waves, which is the first album in history to go both Platinum and Uranium. With his newfound popularity, Doug (a.k.a. DJ Polygon) needs help with a problem most artists would be lucky to face: deciding which of his many gig offers to take.

There are $K$ venues in Graphland, connected by $R$ roads. The venues are numbered $1$ to $K$. Doug’s house is venue $1$, and he is ready to leave or perform at time $t = 0$.

Doug has $G$ gig offers. The $i$-th gig is at venue $V_ i$, runs during the time interval $[S_ i,E_ i)$ (inclusive start, exclusive end), and pays out $M_ i$ cryptocents. Doug can’t take multiple gigs at the same time, and he can’t take gigs while he’s traveling between venues.

Doug is overwhelmed by his newfound fame and many gig requests, and wants your help making as much money as possible.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains three integers $G$, $K$, and $R$: the number of gigs Doug has been offered, the number of venues in Graphland, and the number of roads connecting these venues.

These integers satisfy $1 \leq G \leq 200000$, $1 \leq K \leq 100$, and $0 \leq R \leq \min \left(4000, K(K-1)/2\right)$.

Then follow $R$ lines, each of which has three integers $A_ i$, $B_ i$, and $T_ i$, specifying the $i$-th (bidirectional) road. The $i$-th road connects venues $A_ i$ and $B_ i$ and it takes time $T_ i$ to travel the road in either direction. The values satisfy $1 \leq A_ i, B_ i \leq K$, $A_ i \neq B_ i$, and $1 \leq T_ i \leq 1000000$. Every road has two distinct endpoints, and there is at most one road between any pair of venues.

Then follow $G$ lines, each of which has four integers $V_ i$, $S_ i$, $E_ i$, and $M_ i$. This means the $i$-th gig runs from time $S_ i$ (inclusive) to $E_ i$ (exclusive) at venue $V_ i$, and pays $M_ i$ cryptocents. These values satisfy the bounds $0 \leq S_ i < E_ i \leq 1000000000$ and $1 \leq M_ i \leq 1000000$.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer: the maximum number of cryptocents that DJ Polygon can make by taking on the right gigs.

-----Sample Explanation-----
In the first sample, There are two gigs at venue $1$ and one gig at venue $2$. Doug can either play both gigs at venue $1$ for $11$ cryptocents, or spend the first $10$ units of time traveling to venue $2$ and play that gig for $33$ cryptocents. He chooses the latter.

In the second sample, Doug makes the most by staying at venue $1$ and playing both of those gigs to earn $70$ cryptocents.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3 2 1
1 2 10
1 4 6 6
1 6 10 5
2 10 30 33
Sample Output:
33
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "33
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code that need to be fixed. Let's go through each one:

Bug 1: Time complexity issue
The code uses a nested loop to iterate over each gig offer and each time interval. The time complexity of this approach is too high and will cause the code to exceed the time limit for large inputs. The bounds for the time intervals are up to $10^9$, which means there are $10^9$ possible time values. Multiplying this by the number of gig offers and the number of venues will result in a large time complexity and cause the code to exceed the time limit. This needs to be optimized.

Bug 2: Incorrect maximum cryptocents calculation
The code incorrectly calculates the maximum cryptocents that can be earned at each time for each venue. The inner loop is supposed to iterate over the neighboring venues, but it is actually iterating over the current venue. This will result in incorrect calculations and an incorrect maximum earnings value.

Bug 3: Incorrect initialization of max_cryptocents array
The code initializes the max_cryptocents array with a size of $10^9 + 1$ for each venue. This is unnecessary and inefficient since the maximum time value is up to $10^9$, and the time values come in discrete intervals. The initialization can be optimized to only initialize up to the largest time value encountered in the gig offers.

Now let's discuss the impact these bugs have on the program's functionality:

Bug 1: Time complexity issue
The high time complexity will cause the code to exceed the time limit for large inputs. This means that the code will not be able to handle inputs with a large number of gig offers or a large number of venues.

Bug 2: Incorrect maximum cryptocents calculation
The incorrect calculation of the maximum cryptocents will result in incorrect earnings values. The algorithm is not correctly considering the neighboring venues and their respective travel times when calculating the maximum earnings.

Bug 3: Incorrect initialization of max_cryptocents array
The unnecessary initialization of the max_cryptocents array will waste memory and slow down the program. It is important to optimize the initialization to only allocate memory for the necessary time values.

These bugs need to be fixed to ensure that the program runs correctly and efficiently.
