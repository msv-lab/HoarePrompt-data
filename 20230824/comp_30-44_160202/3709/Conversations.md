I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Snark and Philip are preparing the problemset for the upcoming pre-qualification round for semi-quarter-finals. They have a bank of n problems, and they want to select any non-empty subset of it as a problemset.

k experienced teams are participating in the contest. Some of these teams already know some of the problems. To make the contest interesting for them, each of the teams should know at most half of the selected problems.

Determine if Snark and Philip can make an interesting problemset!


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4) — the number of problems and the number of experienced teams.

Each of the next n lines contains k integers, each equal to 0 or 1. The j-th number in the i-th line is 1 if j-th team knows i-th problem and 0 otherwise.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (quotes for clarity), if it is possible to make an interesting problemset, and "NO" otherwise.

You can print each character either upper- or lowercase ("YeS" and "yes" are valid when the answer is "YES").


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0

Output
NO

Input
3 2
1 0
1 1
0 1

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example you can't make any interesting problemset, because the first team knows all problems.

In the second example you can choose the first and the third problems.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code is intended to solve the problem of determining if it is possible to construct an interesting problemset based on the given conditions. However, there are several bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output. Let's analyze the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.

### Bugs:

1. **Incorrect sum check:** In the code, the sum of team is checked against k to determine if the team knows all the problems. However, instead of checking against k, the sum should be checked against n. This is because each problem has k entries (one for each team), so if the sum of a team is equal to n, it means the team knows all the problems. This bug affects the correctness of the program's logic.

2. **Prematurely terminating the loop:** After finding a team that knows all the problems, the code immediately prints "NO" and exits the program. This means that if there is any subsequent team that also knows all the problems, it will not be checked. This bug could lead to incorrect output if there are multiple teams that know all the problems.

3. **Incomplete output format:** The code is expected to print "YES" or "NO" based on whether it is possible to construct an interesting problemset. However, the code only prints "YES" when there are no teams that know all the problems. There is no corresponding print statement for the case when there is a team that knows all the problems. This is a bug in the output format.

### Impact:

1. The incorrect sum check (Bug 1) affects the correctness of the program's logic. By comparing the sum with the wrong value (k instead of n), the program fails to correctly identify teams that know all the problems. This can lead to incorrect output, as demonstrated in the given example.

2. The premature termination of the loop (Bug 2) can lead to incorrect output when there are multiple teams that know all the problems. If the code exits after finding the first team, it will not check the subsequent teams and may incorrectly assume that there are no teams that know all the problems.

3. The incomplete output format (Bug 3) results in incorrect output, as it doesn't handle the case when there is a team that knows all the problems. The code only prints "YES" when there are no teams that know all the problems, which is incorrect.

### Suggestions:

1. Fix the sum check by comparing the sum with n instead of k. This will correctly identify teams that know all the problems.

2. Remove the premature termination of the loop to ensure that all teams are checked. Instead of immediately printing "NO" and exiting, set a flag to True if a team knows all the problems. After the loop, check the flag and print "NO" if it is True.

3. Include a print statement for the case when there is a team that knows all the problems. This ensures that the output format is complete and correct.

By fixing these bugs and making the suggested improvements, the code should be able to correctly identify if it is possible to construct an interesting problemset.
