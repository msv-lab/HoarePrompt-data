I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Pia is a famous bartender at the hip Stockholm night club Supernova. One of her most impressive feats is the mixing a series of drinks using each of the $N$ distinct drink ingredients in the bar exactly once. She does this in the following way.

First, Pia chooses a number of drinks to make. Each of the drink ingredients are then lined up in front of her in order $1, 2, \dots , N$. For the first drink, she uses some positive number $K$ of ingredients starting from the left, i.e. $1, 2, ..., K$. For the next drink, she uses some positive number $L$ of ingredients starting from the first unused ingredient, i.e. $K + 1, K + 2, \dots , K + L$. She continues this process until the final drink, which uses some set of ingredients $N - M, N - M + 1, \dots , N$.

However, not every pair of ingredients work well in a drink. For example, milk and water would not go very well together. She may not include a bad pair of ingredients in any drink.

So far, she has managed to make a different set of drinks every night. For how many nights can she mix a new set of drinks? We call two sets of drinks different if they do not consist of the exact same drinks (though they are allowed to have drinks in common).

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two integers $1 \le N \le 100000$ and $0 \le P \le 100000$, the number of ingredients and bad pairs of ingredients.

Each of the next $P$ lines contains two integers $1 \le a \not= b \le N$, two ingredients that do not work well together in a drink. The same pair of ingredients may appear multiple times in this list.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer, the number of nights Pia can construct a different set of drinks. Since this number may be large, output the remainder when divided by $10^9 + 7$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
5 3
1 3
4 5
2 4
Sample Output:
5
### Requirements

The solution to this problem involves calculating the number of different sets of drinks that Pia can make. We can start by creating a set to store the bad pairs of ingredients. Then, we read the bad pairs from the input and add them to the set.

Next, we need to calculate the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink. We initialize a list called `num_ingredients` with zeros, where each index represents the number of ingredients that can be used up to that index. We iterate through the list and update each index by checking if the ingredient is in the set of bad pairs. If it's not, we increment the count at that index.

Once we have the `num_ingredients` list, we can calculate the number of different sets of drinks. We initially set the number of nights to 0. Then, we iterate through all possible pairings of starting and ending indices for the drinks. For each pairing, we check if the difference in the number of ingredients between the ending and starting indices is equal to the difference in the indices themselves. If it is, it means that all the ingredients in that range can be used in a drink. We increment the number of nights by 1.

Finally, we print the number of nights modulo 10^9 + 7 to account for the possible large result.

Here's the complete code:

```python
n, p = map(int, input().split())

# Create a set to store the bad pairs of ingredients
bad_pairs = set()

# Read the bad pairs of ingredients and add them to the set
for _ in range(p):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    bad_pairs.add((a, b))
    bad_pairs.add((b, a))

# Calculate the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink
num_ingredients = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    num_ingredients[i] = num_ingredients[i - 1] + (i not in bad_pairs)

# Calculate the number of different sets of drinks
num_nights = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(i, n + 1):
        if num_ingredients[j] - num_ingredients[i - 1] == j - i + 1:
            num_nights = (num_nights + 1) % (10**9 + 7)

print(num_nights)
```

This solution optimizes for efficiency by using a set to store the bad pairs of ingredients and calculating the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink in linear time. The final answer is obtained by iterating through all possible pairings of starting and ending indices and checking if the range of ingredients can be used in a drink.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the provided code that are causing incorrect output. Let's analyze them one by one.

##### Bug 1: Incorrectly initializing the `num_ingredients` list.

In the code, the `num_ingredients` list is initialized with `0` for all positions. However, the list should be initialized with `1` for the first ingredient, as it is always guaranteed to be usable in at least one drink. This bug will cause the code to underestimate the number of nights Pia can construct a different set of drinks.

##### Bug 2: Incorrectly counting the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink.

The code attempts to calculate the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink by iterating over the ingredients and checking if each ingredient is usable or not based on the bad pairs of ingredients. However, the logic is flawed and does not correctly count the number of usable ingredients.

The code is using a cumulative sum approach to count the number of usable ingredients. The idea is to iterate over the ingredients and increment the count if an ingredient is not present in the bad pairs set. However, the implementation is incorrect.

The condition `(i not in bad_pairs)` checks if the current ingredient `i` is present in the bad pairs set. This condition should actually check if the pair `(i, j)` or `(j, i)` is present in the bad pairs set, where `j` is any previously processed ingredient. This bug will cause the code to incorrectly count the number of usable ingredients, leading to incorrect results.

##### Bug 3: Incorrectly calculating the number of different sets of drinks.

The code uses two nested loops to check all possible pairs of ingredients and calculates the number of different sets of drinks that can be made using each pair of ingredients. The logic is flawed and does not correctly determine the number of different sets of drinks.

The condition `num_ingredients[j] - num_ingredients[i - 1] == j - i + 1` checks if the range of ingredients from `i` to `j` (inclusive) can be used in a drink. This condition is incorrect because it only checks if the number of usable ingredients is equal to the length of the range. However, the code does not consider the case where there may be bad pairs of ingredients within the range that make it unusable.

This bug will cause the code to incorrectly count the number of different sets of drinks, leading to incorrect results.

### IMPACT

The bugs in the provided code have the following impact on the program's functionality:

1. Bug 1: Incorrectly initializing the `num_ingredients` list:
   - This bug will cause the code to underestimate the number of nights Pia can construct a different set of drinks.
   - The output will be smaller than the correct result.

2. Bug 2: Incorrectly counting the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink:
   - This bug will cause the code to incorrectly count the number of usable ingredients.
   - The output will not match the correct count of usable ingredients.

3. Bug 3: Incorrectly calculating the number of different sets of drinks:
   - This bug will cause the code to incorrectly count the number of different sets of drinks.
   - The output will not match the correct count of different sets of drinks.

### RECOMMENDATION

To fix the bugs and achieve the correct functionality of the program, the following changes should be made:

1. In the initialization of the `num_ingredients` list, the first element should be set to `1` instead of `0` to account for the first ingredient always being usable.

2. When counting the number of ingredients that can be used in each drink, the condition `(i, j) not in bad_pairs` should be used instead of `(i not in bad_pairs)` to check if a pair of ingredients is usable.

3. When calculating the number of different sets of drinks, the code should iterate over all possible ranges of ingredients and check if there are any bad pairs within the range. The condition `any((k, l) in bad_pairs for k in range(i, j+1) for l in range(i, j+1) if k != l)` can be used to check if there are any bad pairs within the range.

4. The final count of different sets of drinks should be updated using modular arithmetic to avoid integer overflow. The line `num_nights = (num_nights + 1) % (10**9 + 7)` should be modified to `num_nights = (num_nights + 1) % (10**9 + 7)`.

These changes will fix the bugs in the provided code and ensure the correct functionality of the program.
