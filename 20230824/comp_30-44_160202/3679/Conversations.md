I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
It is Catmas time again, and that means a lot of stress for everyone. In the Kattis family everyone used to buy gifts for everyone else, but this becomes more and more expensive every year, since our family keeps growing. 

To make things easier, we decided that this year each person will buy just one gift. We will then put all the gifts in a big bag and choose an order among ourselves, with all orderings being equally likely. Then, in this order, each person picks a gift from the bag, where each gift is chosen with equal probability. If it is their own gift (which they can easily recognize since everyone in the Kattis family is a creative individual making completely unique Catmas gift wrapping), they put it back in the bag and pick another gift. This can take some time, since it might happen that somebody picks their own gift a few times in a row.

This strategy is not perfect, because the last person might still end up with their own gift. When this happens, everyone has to put their gifts back in the bag, and then we restart the entire process all over from the beginning. Now the question is, how long will we have to wait until the process ends and we can start opening our Catmas gifts? Specifically, given the size $n$ of our family, what is the expected total number of gifts taken out of the bag until the process ends and everyone has gotten their gift?

-----Input-----
The input contains one line with one integer $n$ ($2\leq n\leq 1000$) – the current size of the Kattis family.

-----Output-----
Output the expected total number of gifts taken out of the bag, accurate to within an absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
2
Sample Output:
3.000000000
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

"""
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach.
Let's define a function E(n) that represents the expected total number of gifts taken out of the bag for a family of size n.
We can observe that:
- If there are only 2 people in the family, the expected number of gifts taken out is 3. This is because there are only 2 possible orderings: (1, 2) and (2, 1). In both cases, the last person will always get their own gift, so we need to restart the process and take 3 gifts out of the bag.
- For larger families, we can consider the last person in the family (person n). There are n-1 other people who can potentially pick person n's gift. The probability of this happening is (n-1)/n. In this case, we will need to restart the process and take E(n) gifts out of the bag. However, there is also a 1/n chance that person n's gift will be picked by someone else. In this case, person n will not need to restart the process and will just need to pick their gift from the remaining n-1 gifts. 
Therefore, we can write the following recurrence relation:
E(n) = (n-1)/n * (E(n) + 1) + 1/n * (E(n-1) + 1)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
E(n) = n/(n-1) * E(n-1) + 1
We can calculate E(n) iteratively for n = 2 to n using this formula. The base case is E(2) = 3.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
" the output was "5.500000000
" but the expected output was "5.333333333
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs in the given code.

1. The initial value of `E` is incorrect. When `n = 2`, the expected total number of gifts taken out is 3. However, in the given code, the initial value of `E` is set to 0.0 for all indices. This means that the value for `E[2]` is also 0.0 instead of 3.0.

2. The formula used to calculate `E` is incorrect. In the formula `E[i] = i / (i - 1) * E[i - 1] + 1.0`, the multiplication factor `i / (i - 1)` should actually be `1 / (i - 1)`. This is because the probability of person `i` picking someone else's gift is `1 / (i - 1)`, not `i / (i - 1)`.

3. The loop's range is incorrect. In the loop `for i in range(3, n + 1)`, the final index should be `n` instead of `n + 1`. This is because `E` has `n` elements, and we want to calculate `E[n]`.

4. The calculation for `E` is incorrect when `n = 3`. In the calculation `E[i] = i / (i - 1) * E[i - 1] + 1.0`, when `i = 3`, the formula becomes `E[3] = 3 / 2 * E[2] + 1.0`. However, this is incorrect because when `n = 3`, the expected total number of gifts taken out should be `5.333333333` and not `6.0` as calculated by the given formula.

### BUGS SUMMARY

- The initial value of `E` should be set to 3.0 for `E[2]`.
- The formula for calculating `E` should be `E[i] = 1 / (i - 1) * E[i - 1] + 1.0`.
- The loop range should be `range(3, n)` instead of `range(3, n + 1)`.
- The calculation for `E` when `n = 3` is incorrect.

The bugs in the code mentioned above result in incorrect output for the given input `3`. The expected output is `5.333333333` but the code produces `5.500000000`.
