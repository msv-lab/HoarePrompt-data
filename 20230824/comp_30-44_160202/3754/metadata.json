          "feedback": "### Feedback\n\nThere are a few bugs in the provided code:\n\n1. In the `calculate_ways` function, the calculation of `total_ways` is incorrect. The code multiplies each `d_i` value in the `for` loop, but the expected behavior is to add the `d_i` values. Therefore, the line `total_ways = (total_ways * d[i]) % mod` should be changed to `total_ways = (total_ways + d[i]) % mod`.\n\n2. The calculation for the total number of ways is incorrect. The code multiplies the product of all `d_i` values with `2^(N-2)`. However, the correct calculation should be to multiply the product of all `d_i` values with `2^(N-1)`. Therefore, the line `total_ways = (total_ways * pow(2, N-2, mod)) % mod` should be changed to `total_ways = (total_ways * pow(2, N-1, mod)) % mod`.\n\n3. The code does not handle the case where the number of parts `N` is less than 2. Since the problem statement specifies that `N` should be at least 2, this case should be handled explicitly. We can add a check at the beginning of the `calculate_ways` function to return 0 if `N` is less than 2.\n\nWith these changes, the code should be able to calculate the correct number of ways to make the figure complete.",
