I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Takahashi is about to assemble a character figure, consisting of N parts called Part 1, Part 2, ..., Part N and N-1 connecting components. Parts are distinguishable, but connecting components are not.
Part i has d_i holes, called Hole 1, Hole 2, ..., Hole d_i, into which a connecting component can be inserted. These holes in the parts are distinguishable.
Each connecting component will be inserted into two holes in different parts, connecting these two parts. It is impossible to insert multiple connecting components into a hole.
The character figure is said to be complete when it has the following properties:
 - All of the N-1 components are used to connect parts.
 - Consider a graph with N vertices corresponding to the parts and N-1 undirected edges corresponding to the pairs of vertices connected by a connecting component. Then, this graph is connected.
Two ways A and B to make the figure complete are considered the same when the following is satisfied: for every pair of holes, A uses a connecting component to connect these holes if and only if B uses one to connect them.
Find the number of ways to make the figure complete. Since the answer can be enormous, find the count modulo 998244353.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq d_i < 998244353

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 \cdots d_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 1 3

-----Sample Output-----
6

One way to make the figure complete is to connect Hole 1 in Part 1 and Hole 3 in Part 3 and then connect Hole 1 in Part 2 and Hole 1 in Part 3.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Feedback

There are a few bugs in the provided code:

1. In the `calculate_ways` function, the calculation of `total_ways` is incorrect. The code multiplies each `d_i` value in the `for` loop, but the expected behavior is to add the `d_i` values. Therefore, the line `total_ways = (total_ways * d[i]) % mod` should be changed to `total_ways = (total_ways + d[i]) % mod`.

2. The calculation for the total number of ways is incorrect. The code multiplies the product of all `d_i` values with `2^(N-2)`. However, the correct calculation should be to multiply the product of all `d_i` values with `2^(N-1)`. Therefore, the line `total_ways = (total_ways * pow(2, N-2, mod)) % mod` should be changed to `total_ways = (total_ways * pow(2, N-1, mod)) % mod`.

3. The code does not handle the case where the number of parts `N` is less than 2. Since the problem statement specifies that `N` should be at least 2, this case should be handled explicitly. We can add a check at the beginning of the `calculate_ways` function to return 0 if `N` is less than 2.

With these changes, the code should be able to calculate the correct number of ways to make the figure complete.

apologies. Here's the corrected code:

```python
mod = 998244353

def calculate_ways(N, d):
    if N < 2:
        return 0
    
    total_ways = 0
    
    # Calculate the sum of all d_i
    for i in range(N):
        total_ways = (total_ways + d[i]) % mod
    
    # Each connecting component can be used in 2 ways, so multiply by 2^(N-1)
    total_ways = (total_ways * pow(2, N-1, mod)) % mod
    
    return total_ways

N = int(input())
d = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = calculate_ways(N, d)
print(result)
```

I have made the following changes to the code:

1. Added an if condition to check if `N` is less than 2. If it is, then the function returns 0.

2. Changed the calculation of `total_ways` in the `for` loop. Instead of multiplying `total_ways` with `d[i]`, I am adding `d[i]` to `total_ways`.

3. Changed the calculation of `total_ways` after the `for` loop. Instead of multiplying it with `pow(2, N-2, mod)`, I am multiplying it with `pow(2, N-1, mod)`.
