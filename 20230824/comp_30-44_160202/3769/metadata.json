          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n\nThere are a few bugs in the given code. Let's go through each of them:\n\n1. Bug in counting functions: The function `count_functions` is incorrect. It currently returns the result of the `power` function, which is not the correct answer. We need to modify the code to actually count the number of distinct functions.\n\n2. Bug in power function: The `power` function is used to calculate powers of integers modulo `p`. However, there is a bug in the function. The calculation `n = n // 2` should be `n = n >> 1` to perform a bitwise shift. Additionally, the `res` variable should be initialized as `res = a` instead of `res = 1` to handle the case when `n = 1`.\n\n3. Incorrect modulo value: The code uses `1000000007` as the modulo value, which is incorrect. The output should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nNow, let's discuss the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality.\n\n### BUGS AND IMPACT\n\n1. Bug in counting functions:\n   - The `count_functions` function currently returns the result of the `power` function, which is incorrect.\n   - Impact: This bug will cause the program to output the wrong result.\n\n2. Bug in power function:\n   - The `n = n // 2` calculation should be `n = n >> 1` to perform a bitwise shift.\n   - The `res` variable should be initialized as `res = a` to handle the case when `n = 1`.\n   - Impact: This bug will cause incorrect calculations of powers modulo `p`.\n\n3. Incorrect modulo value:\n   - The code uses `1000000007` as the modulo value, which is incorrect.\n   - The output should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n   - Impact: This bug will cause the final answer to be incorrect.\n\n### RECOMMENDATION\n\nTo fix the bugs and improve the code, the following changes can be made:\n\n1. Modify the `count_functions` function to actually count the number of distinct functions instead of returning the result of the `power` function.\n2. Update the `power` function to fix the calculation of powers modulo `p`.\n3. Print the final answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nNote: The bugs mentioned above are impacting the functionality of the program and need to be fixed in order to obtain the correct output.",
