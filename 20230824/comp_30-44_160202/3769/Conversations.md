I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
As behooves any intelligent schoolboy, Kevin Sun is studying psycowlogy, cowculus, and cryptcowgraphy at the Bovinia State University (BGU) under Farmer Ivan. During his Mathematics of Olympiads (MoO) class, Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help. For two fixed integers k and p, where p is an odd prime number, the functional equation states that $f(k x \operatorname{mod} p) \equiv k \cdot f(x) \operatorname{mod} p$ 

for some function $f : \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \} \rightarrow \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \}$. (This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive.)

It turns out that f can actually be many different functions. Instead of finding a solution, Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation. Since the answer may be very large, you should print your result modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The input consists of two space-separated integers p and k (3 ≤ p ≤ 1 000 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ p - 1) on a single line. It is guaranteed that p is an odd prime number.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of distinct functions f modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4

Output
25



-----Note-----

In the first sample, p = 3 and k = 2. The following functions work:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2.  f(0) = 0, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1.  f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3 2
" the output was "27
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the given code. Let's go through each of them:

1. Bug in counting functions: The function `count_functions` is incorrect. It currently returns the result of the `power` function, which is not the correct answer. We need to modify the code to actually count the number of distinct functions.

2. Bug in power function: The `power` function is used to calculate powers of integers modulo `p`. However, there is a bug in the function. The calculation `n = n // 2` should be `n = n >> 1` to perform a bitwise shift. Additionally, the `res` variable should be initialized as `res = a` instead of `res = 1` to handle the case when `n = 1`.

3. Incorrect modulo value: The code uses `1000000007` as the modulo value, which is incorrect. The output should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Now, let's discuss the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality.

### BUGS AND IMPACT

1. Bug in counting functions:
   - The `count_functions` function currently returns the result of the `power` function, which is incorrect.
   - Impact: This bug will cause the program to output the wrong result.

2. Bug in power function:
   - The `n = n // 2` calculation should be `n = n >> 1` to perform a bitwise shift.
   - The `res` variable should be initialized as `res = a` to handle the case when `n = 1`.
   - Impact: This bug will cause incorrect calculations of powers modulo `p`.

3. Incorrect modulo value:
   - The code uses `1000000007` as the modulo value, which is incorrect.
   - The output should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - Impact: This bug will cause the final answer to be incorrect.

### RECOMMENDATION

To fix the bugs and improve the code, the following changes can be made:

1. Modify the `count_functions` function to actually count the number of distinct functions instead of returning the result of the `power` function.
2. Update the `power` function to fix the calculation of powers modulo `p`.
3. Print the final answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Note: The bugs mentioned above are impacting the functionality of the program and need to be fixed in order to obtain the correct output.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE

Here's the corrected code that fixes the bugs mentioned above:

```python
def power(a, n, p):
    res = a
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1:
            res = (res * a) % p
        a = (a * a) % p
        n = n >> 1
    return res

def count_functions(p, k):
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    elif k == 1:
        return p
    else:
        visited = [False] * p
        cycle_count = 0
        for i in range(p):
            if visited[i]:
                continue
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                x = (k * x) % p
            cycle_count += 1
        return power(p, cycle_count, 1000000007)

p, k = map(int, input().split())
num_functions = count_functions(p, k)
print(num_functions)
```

In this code, the following changes have been made to fix the bugs:

1. Modified the `count_functions` function to count the number of distinct functions:
   - Added a new branch for cases when `k` is either 0 or 1. The number of distinct functions in these cases is 1 and `p` respectively.
   - Implemented a cycle counting algorithm to count the number of distinct cycles in the function. Initialize a `visited` list to track visited elements and `cycle_count` to count the number of cycles.
   - Iterate through each element in the range 0 to `p-1`. If an element is already visited, skip it. Otherwise, do the following:
     - Set `x` as the current element.
     - While `x` is not visited:
       - Mark `x` as visited.
       - Update `x` as `(k * x) % p`.
     - Increment `cycle_count` by 1.
   - Finally, calculate and return `power(p, cycle_count, 1000000007)` to handle cases with `k > 1`.
   
2. Updated the `power` function:
   - Initialized `res` as `a` instead of 1 to handle cases when `n = 1`.
   - Modified the `n` calculation to perform a bitwise shift (`n = n >> 1`) instead of floor division (`n = n // 2`).
   - Returned `res` at the end of the function.
   
3. Corrected the modulo value:
   - Changed the modulo value to `1000000007` instead of `10^9 + 7` to calculate the final answer correctly.

With these changes, the code should now produce the correct output for the given inputs.
