          "feedback": "### REVIEW\n\nThe code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the safe cells in an $n \\times n$ Minesweeper game. The approach is to add the indices of the safe cells to a list called `safe_cells`, and then print the number of safe cells followed by the indices.\n\nLet's review the code and identify the bugs:\n\n1. **Incorrect calculation of indices**:\n   - The code uses multiple for loops to calculate the indices of the safe cells, but the calculations are incorrect.\n   - The coordinates of the safe cells are calculated using two variables `i` and `j`, which are not even defined in the code.\n   - The calculations are also different for each loop, making it difficult to understand the logic behind the calculations.\n\n2. **Incorrect output**:\n   - Even with the incorrect calculations, the output is still incorrect.\n   - The output includes duplicate indices and does not match the expected output.\n\n3. **Missing comments and explanation**:\n   - The code lacks comments and explanations, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each section and variable.\n\nLet's discuss these issues in more detail and provide constructive feedback.",
