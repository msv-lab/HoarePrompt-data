I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are the boss of ACM (Association for the Country of Mububa), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination.

Today, you have conquered the unnamed country of Mububa (how an unnamed country has a name is, of course, outside the scope of this problem). Mububa is known for its great, great, bananas. In light of this monumental achievement, you have decided to reward your executives with Mububa’s greatest treasure (which is obviously, bananas). You have prepared $N$ briefcases, each contains a number of bananas. These briefcases are numbered from $1$ through $N$.

You reward your executives one by one in order from the least evil executive, to the most evil executive (still not comparably evil to you, of course). No two executives are equally evil. For each executive, you first decide how many briefcases you want to give him. If you decide to give an executive $a$ briefcases, you give him the $a$ briefcases with lowest numbers that you still have. Each executive you reward must receive at least one briefcase.

It is important to be fair when distributing rewards. You do not want your executives to stage a hunger strike, after all. Thus, the rewards the executives received must reflect how evil they are. More rigorously, if executive $A$ is more evil than executive $B$, then the total number of bananas received by executive $A$ must be at least as large as the total number of bananas received by executive $B$.

You know the number of bananas inside all of the briefcases. You want to reward as many executives as possible, but wants the distribution to still be fair (i.e. following the previous requirement) amongst them. What is the maximum number of executives you can reward this way?

-----Input-----
The first line contains a non-negative integer $2 \leq N \leq 3000$, giving the number of briefcases you have. Then follows a line with $N$ integers, the $i$-th of which denotes the number of bananas in briefcase number $i$. Each briefcase contains between $1$ and $10^9$ bananas, inclusively.

-----Output-----
Print the maximum number of executives you can reward with bananas.Sample Data explanation

In the first example, give briefcase $1$ to the least evil executive, briefcase $2$ to the second least evil executive, and briefcases $3$ and $4$ to the most evil executive.

In the second example, give briefcase $1$ to the least evil executive, briefcases $2$ and $3$ to the second least evil executive, and briefcases $4$, $5$, and $6$ to the most evil executive.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4
1 2 1 2
Sample Output:
3
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

#@!CODE START!@#
"""
The problem statement asks to find the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded with bananas in a fair and evil manner.
Each executive must receive at least one briefcase and the total number of bananas received by a more evil executive must be greater than or equal to the total number of bananas received by a less evil executive.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the number of briefcases, N, from input.
2. Read the number of bananas in each briefcase, bananas, from input.
3. Sort the array bananas in non-decreasing order.
4. Initialize a variable, execs, to 0 to keep track of the number of executives rewarded.
5. Iterate through the briefcases, starting from the least evil executive.
   - For each briefcase, check if the total number of bananas given to the current executive is greater than or equal to the total number of bananas given to the previous executive.
   - If it is, increment the execs variable by 1.
6. Print the value of execs as the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded.

Let's implement this solution in code:
"""

N = int(input())  # Read the number of briefcases
bananas = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the number of bananas in each briefcase

bananas.sort()  # Sort the array in non-decreasing order
execs = 0  # Initialize the variable to keep track of the number of executives rewarded

# Iterate through the briefcases, starting from the least evil executive
for i in range(N):
    # Check if the total number of bananas given to the current executive is greater than or equal to the previous executive
    if sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i]):
        execs += 1  # Increment the execs variable by 1

print(execs)  # Print the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
1 2 1 2
" the output was "4

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code is intended to find the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded with bananas in a fair and evil manner. It reads the number of briefcases and the number of bananas in each briefcase from the input. Then, it sorts the array of bananas in non-decreasing order and initializes a variable `execs` to keep track of the number of executives rewarded.

Next, it iterates through the briefcases, starting from the least evil executive. For each briefcase, it checks if the total number of bananas given to the current executive is greater than or equal to the total number of bananas given to the previous executive. If it is, it increments the `execs` variable by 1. Finally, it prints the value of `execs` as the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded.

There are a few bugs in this code that need to be addressed.

### BUGS
#### 1. Incorrect range in the `for` loop
The `for` loop used to iterate through the briefcases starts from 0 and ends at `N-1`. However, according to the problem statement, the briefcases are numbered starting from 1. Therefore, the `for` loop should start from 1 and end at `N`. 

#### 2. Incorrect condition for checking total number of bananas
The condition `sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i])` is incorrect for checking the total number of bananas. It compares the sum of bananas up to the current briefcase with the sum of bananas up to the previous briefcase. However, to ensure fairness, the total number of bananas received by a more evil executive must be greater than or equal to the total number of bananas received by a less evil executive. Therefore, the condition should be `sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i]) * (i+1)/i`.

#### 3. Incorrect calculation of max executives
The variable `execs` is incremented whenever the condition in the `if` statement is satisfied. However, this does not guarantee that the maximum number of executives has been reached. In the worst case scenario, all executives will be rewarded with exactly one briefcase each, so the maximum number of executives is `N`. Therefore, the variable `execs` should be incremented only if it is less than `i+1`.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
To fix the bugs, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `for` loop to start from 1 and end at `N`.
2. Change the condition in the `if` statement to `sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i]) * (i+1)/i`.
3. Modify the increment of `execs` to `execs += 1` only if `execs` is less than `i+1`.

### BUGGY CODE

# Plan
To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:
1. Modify the `for` loop to start from 1 and end at `N`.
2. Change the condition in the `if` statement to `sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i]) * (i+1)/i`.
3. Modify the increment of `execs` to `execs += 1` only if `execs` is less than `i+1`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
N = int(input())  # Read the number of briefcases
bananas = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the number of bananas in each briefcase

bananas.sort()  # Sort the array in non-decreasing order
execs = 0  # Initialize the variable to keep track of the number of executives rewarded

# Iterate through the briefcases, starting from the least evil executive
for i in range(1, N+1):
    # Check if the total number of bananas given to the current executive is greater than or equal to the previous executive
    if sum(bananas[:i+1]) >= sum(bananas[:i]) * (i+1)/i:
        execs += 1  # Increment the execs variable by 1 if it is less than i+1

print(execs)  # Print the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded
```

This code should now correctly find the maximum number of executives that can be rewarded with bananas in a fair and evil manner.
