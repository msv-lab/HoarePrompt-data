I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Two bicycle courier services have been competing in Metro City for many years, stealing customers back and forth from one another. Recently, they have come to realize that they would be better off if they could attract new customers instead. A problem is that, over time, each company’s customers have become so widely scattered across the city that some of their delivery times are unacceptably slow, leading to customer dissatisfaction and a poor reputation.

The companies would like to divide up their current customers so that each company could run ads saying “We guarantee delivery in no more than M minutes”, hoping to attract new customers. The streets of Metro City are laid out on a grid, with buildings at integer coordinates of the grid. The couriers must travel along those roads – they cannot cut through buildings. It takes one minute to travel one unit of distance in the $x$ or $y$ direction.

Divide up the current customer base to minimize the longest delivery time required by either company to have a courier travel from one customer of that company to any other customer of the same company.
 - A delivery is considered to have been completed when the courier reaches the $(x,y)$ address of the customer. No time is counted for wandering the hallways of the customer’s building.
 - It is acceptable that a courier traveling from one customer to another will pass by customers of the same or of the other company. No extra time delay is accrued for riding past a customer.
 - If it should happen that one company winds up with only a single customer, that company puts someone on site to deliver messages within that one building. This is considered a zero delivery time.

-----Input-----
Input starts with one line containing an integer $N$, the number of customers to be divided up, where $2 < N \leq 1000$.

This is followed by $N$ lines, each containing a pair of integers $x$ and $y$ denoting the position of one customer, where $0 \leq x, y \leq 1000$.

-----Output-----
Print a single line containing the longest delivery time required by the two companies (i.e., the maximum of the two longest delivery times offered by each company separately).

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
6
1 1
4 1
1 5
10 10
10 8
7 10
Sample Output:
7
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "18

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code provided is trying to find the maximum delivery time required by the two companies to deliver their customers. It calculates the distance between each pair of customers and keeps track of the maximum distance.

There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output:
1. The variable name `max_delivery_time` is the same as the function name. This can cause confusion and may lead to incorrect results.
2. The code calculates the distance using the Manhattan distance formula, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates. However, the problem statement specifies that it takes one minute to travel one unit of distance in the x or y direction. Therefore, the calculation should be the maximum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.
3. The code initializes `max_delivery_time` to 0. This will cause incorrect results if all the customers have the same coordinates, as the maximum delivery time should be 0 in that case.
4. The code is not correctly calculating the maximum delivery time required by the two companies separately. It is only considering the maximum delivery time of all the customers combined.
5. The code does not handle the case when one company has only a single customer. In that case, the delivery time should be 0 for that company.

### BUGS
1. The variable name `max_delivery_time` is the same as the function name.
2. Incorrect calculation of distance using the Manhattan distance formula.
3. Incorrect initialization of `max_delivery_time` variable.
4. Incorrect calculation of the maximum delivery time required by the two companies separately.
5. Lack of handling the case when one company has only a single customer.

### IMPACT
These bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:
1. The variable name `max_delivery_time` being the same as the function name does not directly affect the functionality, but it can cause confusion and make the code less readable.
2. Incorrect calculation of distance using the Manhattan distance formula will result in incorrect maximum delivery times.
3. Incorrect initialization of `max_delivery_time` variable will lead to incorrect results if all customers have the same coordinates.
4. Incorrect calculation of the maximum delivery time required by the two companies separately will give incorrect output.
5. Lack of handling the case when one company has only a single customer will give incorrect delivery time for that company.
