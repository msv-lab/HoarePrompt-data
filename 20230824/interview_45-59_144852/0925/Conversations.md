I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Malek lives in an apartment block with 100 floors numbered from 0 to 99. The apartment has an elevator with a digital counter showing the floor that the elevator is currently on. The elevator shows each digit of a number with 7 light sticks by turning them on or off. The picture below shows how the elevator shows each digit.[Image]

One day when Malek wanted to go from floor 88 to floor 0 using the elevator he noticed that the counter shows number 89 instead of 88. Then when the elevator started moving the number on the counter changed to 87. After a little thinking Malek came to the conclusion that there is only one explanation for this: One of the sticks of the counter was broken. Later that day Malek was thinking about the broken stick and suddenly he came up with the following problem.

Suppose the digital counter is showing number n. Malek calls an integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 99) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show x but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing n instead. Malek wants to know number of good integers for a specific n. So you must write a program that calculates this number. Please note that the counter always shows two digits.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains exactly two digits representing number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 99). Note that n may have a leading zero.


-----Output-----

In the only line of the output print the number of good integers.


-----Examples-----
Input
89

Output
2

Input
00

Output
4

Input
73

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the first sample the counter may be supposed to show 88 or 89.

In the second sample the good integers are 00, 08, 80 and 88.

In the third sample the good integers are 03, 08, 09, 33, 38, 39, 73, 78, 79, 83, 88, 89, 93, 98, 99.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "89
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the provided code:

Bug 1: Inputs are not being read correctly
The input is not being read correctly. The code simply uses the `input()` function to get the value of `n`, but this will actually read the entire line as a string. We need to convert the input string into an integer before using it in the code.

Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of required number of broken sticks
The code is using the `count()` method to count the number of 0's in the input string `n` and comparing it to the required number of broken sticks. However, this comparison is incorrect. The required number of broken sticks should be compared to the total count of 0's and 9's in the input string `n`. This is because both 0 and 9 require the same number of broken sticks. We need to modify the code to calculate the count of 0's and 9's separately and then compare the required number of broken sticks to the sum of the counts.

Bug 3: Missing leading zero
The code only considers two-digit numbers from 0 to 99. However, there is a possibility that the input `n` is a single digit, in which case there will be a missing leading zero. We need to add a check for single digit input and handle it separately.

### BUGGY CODE CONTINUED:

Bug 4: Incorrect calculation of good integers
The code is iterating over all possible integers from 0 to 99. However, it is not correctly calculating the number of good integers. The condition `required_sticks <= n.count('0')` is checking if the required number of broken sticks is less than or equal to the count of 0's in the input string `n`. This condition will not provide the correct count of good integers. We need to modify the code to compare the required number of broken sticks to the count of 0's and 9's in the input string `n`, as mentioned earlier.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE CONTINUED:

Bug 5: Incorrect digits mapping
The code provided in the comment for creating the digit map is incorrect. For example, it maps the digit '1' to 2 required broken sticks, but in the explanation it states that '1' requires 2 light sticks. We need to fix the digit mapping to match the given problem statement.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the code as follows:

#@!CODE START!@#

n = int(input())

# Create a dictionary to map each digit to the required number of broken sticks
digit_map = {'0': 6, '1': 2, '2': 5, '3': 5, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 3, '8': 7, '9': 6}

# Initialize the count of good integers to 0
count = 0

# Check if the input is single digit
if n < 10:
    # Handle single digit input
    required_sticks = digit_map[str(n)]
    if required_sticks <= 2:
        count += 1
else:
    # Split the input number into its two digits
    digit1 = n // 10
    digit2 = n % 10

    # Calculate the required number of broken sticks for each digit
    required_sticks = digit_map[str(digit1)] + digit_map[str(digit2)]

    # Calculate the count of 0's and 9's in the input number
    count_zeros = str(n).count('0')
    count_nines = str(n).count('9')

    # Check if the sum of the counts is greater than or equal to the required number of broken sticks
    if count_zeros + count_nines >= required_sticks:
        count += 1

# Print the count of good integers
print(count)
  
#@!CODE END!@#
