I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Calculate the minimum number of characters you need to change in the string s, so that it contains at least k different letters, or print that it is impossible.

String s consists only of lowercase Latin letters, and it is allowed to change characters only to lowercase Latin letters too.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains string s, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, |s| denotes the length of s).

Second line of input contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).


-----Output-----

Print single line with a minimum number of necessary changes, or the word «impossible» (without quotes) if it is impossible.


-----Examples-----
Input
yandex
6

Output
0

Input
yahoo
5

Output
1

Input
google
7

Output
impossible



-----Note-----

In the first test case string contains 6 different letters, so we don't need to change anything.

In the second test case string contains 4 different letters: {'a', 'h', 'o', 'y'}. To get 5 different letters it is necessary to change one occurrence of 'o' to some letter, which doesn't occur in the string, for example, {'b'}.

In the third test case, it is impossible to make 7 different letters because the length of the string is 6.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
