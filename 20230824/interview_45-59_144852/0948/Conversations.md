I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The developers of Looksery have to write an efficient algorithm that detects faces on a picture. Unfortunately, they are currently busy preparing a contest for you, so you will have to do it for them. 

In this problem an image is a rectangular table that consists of lowercase Latin letters. A face on the image is a 2 × 2 square, such that from the four letters of this square you can make word "face". 

You need to write a program that determines the number of faces on the image. The squares that correspond to the faces can overlap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the height and the width of the image, respectively.

Next n lines define the image. Each line contains m lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

In the single line print the number of faces on the image.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4
xxxx
xfax
xcex
xxxx

Output
1

Input
4 2
xx
cf
ae
xx

Output
1

Input
2 3
fac
cef

Output
2

Input
1 4
face

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample the image contains a single face, located in a square with the upper left corner at the second line and the second column:  [Image] 

In the second sample the image also contains exactly one face, its upper left corner is at the second row and the first column.

In the third sample two faces are shown:  $\text{fac}$ 

In the fourth sample the image has no faces on it.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The loop indices of the face detection loop should be from 0 to n-2 and m-2, instead of from 0 to n-1 and m-1. 
   - Currently, the loop indices are going out of bounds when accessing the grid, causing unexpected results.

2. The face detection loop is not iterating over the correct indices. The indices should correspond to the top left corner of each possible face square. 
   - Currently, the loop is iterating over i and j, which represent the top left corner of the squares, but in each iteration, it constructs the face string using grid[i][j], grid[i][j+1], grid[i+1][j], and grid[i+1][j+1].
   - This means that the constructed face string is actually using the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right corners of the square, not the top left corner as intended.

3. The face variable is being constructed incorrectly. The order of the letters should be "f", "a", "c", "e", but the code is currently constructing the face variable in the order of "t", "r", "l", "b". 
   - This means that even if a valid face square is found, the face variable will never be equal to "face".

4. The count variable is not being incremented correctly. The count variable should be incremented whenever a valid face square is found. 
   - Currently, the count variable is not being incremented, causing the final count to always be 0.

### PLAN

To fix the bugs mentioned above, the following steps can be taken:

1. Change the loop indices in the face detection loop from range(n-1) to range(n-2) and range(m-1) to range(m-2).

2. Adjust the indices being used to construct the face variable so that they correspond to the top left corner of each possible face square.

3. Change the order of the letters in the face variable to "f", "a", "c", "e".

4. Increment the count variable whenever a valid face square is found.

Let's update the code accordingly.
