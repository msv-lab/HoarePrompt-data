I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You're given an array $a$ of length $2n$. Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first $n$ elements isn't equal to the sum of the last $n$ elements?


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), where $2n$ is the number of elements in the array $a$.

The second line contains $2n$ space-separated integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_{2n}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$) — the elements of the array $a$.


-----Output-----

If there's no solution, print "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing $2n$ space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of $a$. You are allowed to not change the order.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 2 2 1 3 1

Output
2 1 3 1 1 2
Input
1
1 1

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first example, the first $n$ elements have sum $2+1+3=6$ while the last $n$ elements have sum $1+1+2=4$. The sums aren't equal.

In the second example, there's no solution.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

def reorder_array(n: int, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Sort the array in non-decreasing order
    arr.sort()
    
    # If the sum of the first n elements is equal to the sum of the last n elements, return -1
    if sum(arr[:n]) == sum(arr[n:]):
        return [-1]
    
    return arr

# Read the input values
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Reorder the array
reordered_array = reorder_array(n, arr)

# Output the result
print(' '.join(map(str, reordered_array)))
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
1 2 2 1 3 1
" the output was "1 1 1 2 2 3
" but the expected output was "2 1 3 1 1 2".

" but the expected output was "2 1 3 1 1 2".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

The code provided is incorrect and contains several bugs. Let's go through them one by one:

1. In the `reorder_array` function, the code sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method. However, this sorting doesn't meet the requirement of potentially not changing the order of the elements. This sorting will affect the positions of the elements.

2. The code checks if the sum of the first $n$ elements is equal to the sum of the last $n$ elements. If they are equal, it returns `[-1]`. However, the problem statement requires returning `-1` if it is not possible to reorder the array in a way that satisfies the condition. The current logic is incorrect.

3. The function `reorder_array` returns the sorted array if the sums are not equal. However, it should return the reordered array, not the sorted array.

4. In the main code, the input is read using `input()` and `split()` functions, but the input prompt indicates that the input will be provided as function arguments. The code should be modified to accommodate the input format mentioned in the prompt.

5. The output format doesn't match the expected output format. The expected output is a single line of space-separated integers, but the code outputs each element on a separate line.

6. The variable names are not very descriptive. Lengthy names can help make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Overall, the logic for reordering the array and checking the sums is not implemented correctly. Let's fix these issues one by one.

The provided code has several bugs. I will address each issue and propose the necessary changes:

1. The code sorts the array using the `sort()` method. However, the task requires us to consider the potential scenario of not changing the order of the elements. Therefore, we should not sort the array.

2. The current logic for determining whether the sums of the two parts are equal and returning `-1` is incorrect. Instead, we should compare the sums of the first $n$ elements and the last $n$ elements. If they are equal, it is not possible to reorder the array as required. We should return `-1` in this case.

3. The function `reorder_array` should return the reordered array, not the sorted array. Upon reordering, if it is not possible to satisfy the condition, we should return `-1`. Otherwise, we should return the reordered array.

4. We don't need to use the `input()` and `split()` functions to read the input values. The values are provided as function arguments. We should modify the function definition accordingly.

5. We need to modify the output format to match the expected format. We should output a single line of space-separated integers.

Let's implement the necessary changes to fix these issues in the code:

```python
from typing import List

def reorder_array(n: int, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Compare the sums of the first n elements and the last n elements
    if sum(arr[:n]) == sum(arr[n:]):
        return [-1]
    
    return arr

# Read the input values
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Reorder the array
reordered_array = reorder_array(n, arr)

# Output the result
print(' '.join(map(str, reordered_array)))
```

Please note that there may be additional test cases to check whether the code produces the correct output.
