          "feedback": "### Review\n\nThe code provided is incorrect and contains several bugs. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. In the `reorder_array` function, the code sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method. However, this sorting doesn't meet the requirement of potentially not changing the order of the elements. This sorting will affect the positions of the elements.\n\n2. The code checks if the sum of the first $n$ elements is equal to the sum of the last $n$ elements. If they are equal, it returns `[-1]`. However, the problem statement requires returning `-1` if it is not possible to reorder the array in a way that satisfies the condition. The current logic is incorrect.\n\n3. The function `reorder_array` returns the sorted array if the sums are not equal. However, it should return the reordered array, not the sorted array.\n\n4. In the main code, the input is read using `input()` and `split()` functions, but the input prompt indicates that the input will be provided as function arguments. The code should be modified to accommodate the input format mentioned in the prompt.\n\n5. The output format doesn't match the expected output format. The expected output is a single line of space-separated integers, but the code outputs each element on a separate line.\n\n6. The variable names are not very descriptive. Lengthy names can help make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n\nOverall, the logic for reordering the array and checking the sums is not implemented correctly. Let's fix these issues one by one.",
