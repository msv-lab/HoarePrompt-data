I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Our old friend Alexey has finally entered the University of City N — the Berland capital. Alexey expected his father to get him a place to live in but his father said it was high time for Alexey to practice some financial independence. So, Alexey is living in a dorm. 

The dorm has exactly one straight dryer — a 100 centimeter long rope to hang clothes on. The dryer has got a coordinate system installed: the leftmost end of the dryer has coordinate 0, and the opposite end has coordinate 100. Overall, the university has n students. Dean's office allows i-th student to use the segment (l_{i}, r_{i}) of the dryer. However, the dean's office actions are contradictory and now one part of the dryer can belong to multiple students!

Alexey don't like when someone touch his clothes. That's why he want make it impossible to someone clothes touch his ones. So Alexey wonders: what is the total length of the parts of the dryer that he may use in a such way that clothes of the others (n - 1) students aren't drying there. Help him! Note that Alexey, as the most respected student, has number 1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The (i + 1)-th line contains integers l_{i} and r_{i} (0 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ 100) — the endpoints of the corresponding segment for the i-th student.


-----Output-----

On a single line print a single number k, equal to the sum of lengths of the parts of the dryer which are inside Alexey's segment and are outside all other segments.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 5
2 8
1 6

Output
1

Input
3
0 10
1 5
7 15

Output
3



-----Note-----

Note that it's not important are clothes drying on the touching segments (e.g. (0, 1) and (1, 2)) considered to be touching or not because you need to find the length of segments.

In the first test sample Alexey may use the only segment (0, 1). In such case his clothes will not touch clothes on the segments (1, 6) and (2, 8). The length of segment (0, 1) is 1.

In the second test sample Alexey may dry his clothes on segments (0, 1) and (5, 7). Overall length of these segments is 3.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

This code is attempting to solve the problem of determining the total length of the dryer that Alexey can use without overlapping with the segments of other students. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.

#### 1. Incorrect input reading
The code reads the input incorrectly. It assumes that the first line of input contains a positive integer n, which represents the number of students. However, in the provided examples, the first line of input actually contains the segments for the first student. The correct approach would be to read the segments first and then determine n based on the number of segments provided.

#### 2. Incorrect initialization of Alexey's segment
The code assumes that the segment for Alexey is always the first segment in the list. However, the problem statement states that Alexey is the "most respected student" and has number 1. This means that his segment can be located in any position in the segments list. The code should find Alexey's segment based on his student number rather than assuming it is always the first segment.

#### 3. Incorrect check for overlapping segments
The code uses nested loops to iterate over the coordinates of the dryer and checks if any other segment overlaps with a given coordinate. However, the logic is incorrect. The current implementation only checks if a coordinate is within any of the segments, which does not guarantee that the dryer is not occupied by other students. The code needs to check if a coordinate is within any segment **other than** Alexey's segment.

#### 4. Missing condition for counting the total length
The code only increments the `total_length` variable if a coordinate is within Alexey's segment. However, it does not check if that coordinate is also outside all other segments. The code needs to add a condition to check if a coordinate is not within any other segments before incrementing `total_length`.

#### 5. Incorrect calculation of total length
The code only increments the `total_length` variable by 1 for each valid coordinate, regardless of the length of the dryer segment at that coordinate. The correct approach would be to increment the `total_length` by the length of the dryer segment at that coordinate.

#### 6. Incorrect upper limit for iteration
The code uses a fixed upper limit of 101 to iterate over the coordinates of the dryer. However, this assumes that the dryer is always 100 centimeters long. The problem statement does not mention such a constraint, so the code should adapt to the actual length of the dryer.

#### Bugs Summary
1. Incorrect input reading
2. Incorrect initialization of Alexey's segment
3. Incorrect check for overlapping segments
4. Missing condition for counting the total length
5. Incorrect calculation of total length
6. Incorrect upper limit for iteration

### Suggestions
Since the user wants to fix the bugs themselves, I will not provide a solution. Instead, I will provide detailed feedback on each bug and how to fix it.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect input reading
Currently, the code assumes that the first line of input contains a positive integer n, which represents the number of students. However, in the provided examples, the first line of input actually contains the segments for the first student. The correct approach would be to read the segments first and then determine n based on the number of segments provided.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
n = int(input())
```

With:
```python
segments = []
while True:
    segment_input = input()
    if not segment_input:
        break
    l, r = map(int, segment_input.split())
    segments.append((l, r))
n = len(segments)
```

With this fix, the code will correctly read the segments and determine the number of students based on the length of the segments list.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect initialization of Alexey's segment
The code assumes that the segment for Alexey is always the first segment in the list. However, the problem statement states that Alexey is the "most respected student" and has number 1. This means that his segment can be located in any position in the segments list. You need to modify the code to find Alexey's segment based on his student number rather than assuming it is always the first segment.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
alexey_l, alexey_r = segments[0]
```

With:
```python
alexey_l, alexey_r = None, None
for l, r in segments:
    if l == 0:
        alexey_l, alexey_r = l, r
        break
assert alexey_l is not None and alexey_r is not None, "Alexey's segment not found"
```

With this fix, the code will correctly find Alexey's segment based on his student number.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect check for overlapping segments
The code uses nested loops to iterate over the coordinates of the dryer and checks if any other segment overlaps with a given coordinate. However, the logic is incorrect. The current implementation only checks if a coordinate is within any of the segments, which does not guarantee that the dryer is not occupied by other students. You need to modify the code to check if a coordinate is within any segment **other than** Alexey's segment.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
if any(l <= i <= r for l, r in segments[1:]):
    continue
```

With:
```python
if any(l <= i <= r for l, r in segments[1:] if not (alexey_l <= i <= alexey_r)):
    continue
```

With this fix, the code will correctly check if a coordinate is within any segment other than Alexey's segment.

#### Bug 4: Missing condition for counting the total length
The code only increments the `total_length` variable if a coordinate is within Alexey's segment. However, it does not check if that coordinate is also outside all other segments. You need to modify the code to add a condition to check if a coordinate is not within any other segments before incrementing `total_length`.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
if alexey_l <= i <= alexey_r:
    total_length += 1
```

With:
```python
if alexey_l <= i <= alexey_r and not any(l <= i <= r for l, r in segments[1:]):
    total_length += 1
```

With this fix, the code will correctly check if a coordinate is within Alexey's segment and not within any other segments before incrementing `total_length`.

#### Bug 5: Incorrect calculation of total length
The code only increments the `total_length` variable by 1 for each valid coordinate, regardless of the length of the dryer segment at that coordinate. The correct approach would be to increment the `total_length` by the length of the dryer segment at that coordinate.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
total_length += 1
```

With:
```python
total_length += min(alexey_r, i + 1) - max(alexey_l, i)
```

With this fix, the code will correctly calculate the length of the dryer segment at each valid coordinate and add it to the `total_length`.

#### Bug 6: Incorrect upper limit for iteration
The code uses a fixed upper limit of 101 to iterate over the coordinates of the dryer. However, this assumes that the dryer is always 100 centimeters long. The problem statement does not mention such a constraint, so the code should adapt to the actual length of the dryer.

To fix this, you need to modify the code as follows:

Replace:
```python
for i in range(101):
```

With:
```python
for i in range(101):
    if i >= 100:
        break
```

With this fix, the code will correctly adapt to the actual length of the dryer and avoid exceeding the coordinate range.

### Conclusion
After implementing these fixes, the code should correctly determine the total length of the dryer that Alexey can use without overlapping with the segments of other students.
