I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $k$ subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.

Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string $s$ is a subset of ten characters of $s$ that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.

Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least $k$ codeforces subsequences.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 10^{16})$.


-----Output-----

Print a shortest string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $k$ codeforces subsequences. If there are several such strings, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
codeforces

Input
3

Output
codeforcesss
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

powers = [0] * 10

index = 0

print(result)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1
" the output was "
" but the expected output was "codeforces
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
The code has several bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through the code and discuss the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.

#### Bugs:
1. The prime factors list is incomplete. It should include all prime numbers up to 29.
2. The while loop condition is incorrect. It should check if `k > 0` instead of `k > 1`.
3. The powers list is not being updated correctly. Instead of adding 1 to the power, it should multiply the power by the factor.
4. The result string is not being constructed correctly. It should be concatenated using the `+=` operator, not multiplied by the power.

#### Location of Bugs:
1. The bug occurs in the `prime_factors` list. The list should include all prime numbers up to 29.
2. The bug occurs in the while loop condition at line 6.
3. The bug occurs in the powers list at line 8.
4. The bug occurs in the result string concatenation at line 15.

#### Impact on Program's Functionality:
1. The incomplete `prime_factors` list will not correctly identify the prime factors of `k`, leading to incorrect powers.
2. The incorrect while loop condition will terminate the loop prematurely, not correctly identifying all the prime factors of `k`.
3. The incorrect powers update will not correctly calculate the powers of prime factors.
4. The incorrect result string concatenation will not construct the string with the correct number of codeforces subsequences.

These bugs have a significant impact on the program's functionality, resulting in incorrect output.
