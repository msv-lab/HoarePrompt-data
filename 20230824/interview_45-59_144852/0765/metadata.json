However, there are some bugs in the code that are causing incorrect results.\n\n**Bug 1: Exiting the loop too early**\nThe first bug occurs in the while loop condition `downloaded < T`. The goal is for the loop to run until the entire song is downloaded. However, the code checks if the total downloaded part is less than the song's duration, which is incorrect. The loop should run until the total downloaded part is greater than or equal to the song's duration.\n\n**Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of the downloaded part**\nThe second bug occurs in the line `downloaded *= q`. The intention is to increase the downloaded part based on the download speed. However, the code multiplies the current downloaded part by the download speed `q`. This is incorrect because the download speed represents the number of seconds it takes to download `q-1` seconds of the song. Hence, the correct calculation should be `(downloaded + q-1) // q` to get the updated downloaded part.\n\n### BUGGY CODE",
