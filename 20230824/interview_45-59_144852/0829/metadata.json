          "feedback": "### Observations:\n\nThere are a few issues with the given code.\n\n1. The code doesn't handle the case properly when the last substring is formed. It only checks for equality between the count of '0's and '1's, but doesn't consider the remaining characters in the string.\n2. The code doesn't append the last formed substring to the list of substrings.\n3. The code initializes the `current_substring` variable as an empty string, but it should be initialized with the first character of the string `s`.\n4. The code does not account for the fact that there can be multiple valid substrings in the given string.\n\n### Bugs:\n\n1. The current substring is not being properly constructed and appended to the list of substrings when a valid substring is formed.\n2. The last formed substring is not being appended to the list of substrings.\n3. The code does not account for the first character of the string. The initial `current_substring` and the counts of '0's and '1's are not being properly set.\n\n### Incorrect code with bugs:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\ns = input()\n\n# initialize variables\nsubstrings = [] # to store the valid substrings\ncurrent_substring = \"\" # to store the current substring being formed\ncount_0 = 0 # to count the number of zeroes\ncount_1 = 0 # to count the number of ones\n\n# iterate through each character in s\nfor char in s:\n    # if character is '0', increment count_0\n    if char == '0':\n        count_0 += 1\n    # if character is '1', increment count_1\n    if char == '1':\n        count_1 += 1\n    \n    # if count of zeroes and ones are equal, we have formed a valid substring\n    if count_0 == count_1:\n        substrings.append(current_substring + char) # add the current substring to the list\n        current_substring = \"\" # reset current_substring\n        count_0 = 0 # reset count_0\n        count_1 = 0 # reset count_1\n    else:\n        current_substring += char # append the current character to the current_substring\n\n# print the minimal number of strings and the substrings\nprint(len(substrings))\nprint(\" \".join(substrings))\n```\n\n### Test cases:\n\nTo further investigate the bugs and possible edge cases, I will test the code with a few different inputs.\n\nTest case 1:\n```python\nn = 1\ns = \"1\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n1\n1\n```\nTest case 2:\n```python\nn = 2\ns = \"10\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n2\n1 0\n```\nTest case 3:\n```python\nn = 6\ns = \"100011\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n2\n100 011\n```\nTest case 4:\n```python\nn = 5\ns = \"11110\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n3\n1111 0\n```\nTest case 5:\n```python\nn = 6\ns = \"111000\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n2\n111 000\n```\nTest case 6:\n```python\nn = 4\ns = \"1010\"\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n4\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### Bugs and impact:\n\n1. The current substring is not being properly constructed and appended to the list of substrings when a valid substring is formed. This bug leads to incorrect substrings being stored in the list.\n2. The last formed substring is not being appended to the list of substrings. This bug causes the last substring to be missing from the final output.\n3. The code does not account for the first character of the string. The initial `current_substring` and the counts of '0's and '1's are not being properly set. This leads to incorrect substrings and counts.\n\nThe bugs mentioned above impact the program's functionality by producing incorrect output for the given inputs.",
