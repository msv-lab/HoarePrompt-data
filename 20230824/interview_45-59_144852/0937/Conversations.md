I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Your friend Mishka and you attend a calculus lecture. Lecture lasts n minutes. Lecturer tells a_{i} theorems during the i-th minute.

Mishka is really interested in calculus, though it is so hard to stay awake for all the time of lecture. You are given an array t of Mishka's behavior. If Mishka is asleep during the i-th minute of the lecture then t_{i} will be equal to 0, otherwise it will be equal to 1. When Mishka is awake he writes down all the theorems he is being told — a_{i} during the i-th minute. Otherwise he writes nothing.

You know some secret technique to keep Mishka awake for k minutes straight. However you can use it only once. You can start using it at the beginning of any minute between 1 and n - k + 1. If you use it on some minute i then Mishka will be awake during minutes j such that $j \in [ i, i + k - 1 ]$ and will write down all the theorems lecturer tells.

You task is to calculate the maximum number of theorems Mishka will be able to write down if you use your technique only once to wake him up.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the duration of the lecture in minutes and the number of minutes you can keep Mishka awake.

The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ... a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4) — the number of theorems lecturer tells during the i-th minute.

The third line of the input contains n integer numbers t_1, t_2, ... t_{n} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 1) — type of Mishka's behavior at the i-th minute of the lecture.


-----Output-----

Print only one integer — the maximum number of theorems Mishka will be able to write down if you use your technique only once to wake him up.


-----Example-----
Input
6 3
1 3 5 2 5 4
1 1 0 1 0 0

Output
16



-----Note-----

In the sample case the better way is to use the secret technique at the beginning of the third minute. Then the number of theorems Mishka will be able to write down will be equal to 16.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

**1. Incorrect loop range**
In the loop that uses the secret technique, the loop range should be `range(n - k + 1)` instead of `range(n - k)`. This is because the range should include the last minute where the technique can be used.

**2. Incorrect calculation of asleep_theorems**
In the loop that uses the secret technique, the calculation of `asleep_theorems` is incorrect. It should subtract the theorems from `asleep_theorems` for the current minute, not `current_theorems`. Similarly, it should add the theorems for the next minute to `asleep_theorems`, not `current_theorems`.

**3. Incorrect use of current_theorems**
In the loop that uses the secret technique, the calculation of `current_theorems` is incorrect. It should subtract the theorems from `current_theorems` for the current minute, not `asleep_theorems`. Similarly, it should add the theorems for the next minute to `current_theorems`, not `asleep_theorems`.

### IMPACT

These bugs cause the program to incorrectly calculate the maximum number of theorems Mishka can write down when using the secret technique. As a result, the program outputs a wrong result.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Change the loop range in the loop that uses the secret technique to `range(n - k + 1)`.
2. Change the calculation of `asleep_theorems` in the loop that uses the secret technique to subtract the theorems from `asleep_theorems` for the current minute and add the theorems for the next minute to `asleep_theorems`.
3. Change the calculation of `current_theorems` in the loop that uses the secret technique to subtract the theorems from `current_theorems` for the current minute and add the theorems for the next minute to `current_theorems`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
theorems = list(map(int, input().split()))
behavior = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_theorems = 0
current_theorems = 0
asleep_theorems = 0

# Calculate the initial theorems Mishka can write down
for i in range(n):
    if behavior[i] == 1:
        current_theorems += theorems[i]
    else:
        asleep_theorems += theorems[i]

# Store the maximum theorems Mishka can write down
max_theorems = current_theorems

# Use the secret technique
for i in range(n - k + 1):
    if behavior[i] == 0:
        asleep_theorems -= theorems[i]
    else:
        current_theorems -= theorems[i]
    
    if behavior[i + k] == 0:
        asleep_theorems += theorems[i + k]
    else:
        current_theorems += theorems[i + k]
    
    # Update the maximum theorems if necessary
    max_theorems = max(max_theorems, current_theorems + asleep_theorems)

print(max_theorems)
```

With these fixes, the code will correctly calculate the maximum number of theorems Mishka can write down when using the secret technique and output the expected result.
