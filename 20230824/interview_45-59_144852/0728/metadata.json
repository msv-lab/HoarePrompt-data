The function `minimum_bribes` assumes that Limak is always the first candidate (candidate number 1). However, it is not necessary that Limak is always in the first position. The code should find the index of Limak instead of assuming it is the first candidate.\n\n2. The calculation for `bribes` is incorrect. The current formula calculates the difference between the maximum votes of the other candidates and Limak's votes, and then adds 1 to it. However, it should instead calculate the difference between the maximum votes and Limak's votes, and then only add 1 to it if the difference is positive. The reason for this is that if Limak already has more votes than the maximum of the other candidates, no bribes are required.\n\n3. The code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes. In this case, Limak cannot win by bribing citizens. The code should handle this case separately and return 0 if there is a tie for the maximum votes.\n\n4. The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate. In this case, no bribes are required and the code should return 0.\n\n### BUGS\n\nBug 1: The function assumes Limak is always the first candidate.\n\nBug 2: The calculation for `bribes` is incorrect.\n\nBug 3: The code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes.\n\nBug 4: The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate.\n\n### IMPACT\n\nBug 1: Since the code assumes Limak is always the first candidate, it will give incorrect results if Limak is not the first. This will lead to incorrect number of bribes required to win the election.\n\nBug 2: The incorrect calculation for `bribes` will lead to incorrect number of bribes required to win the election. This could result in incorrect results or a higher number of bribes than necessary.\n\nBug 3: Since the code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes, it will not produce the correct output in such cases. The code will give incorrect results and may suggest bribes even when it is not possible for Limak to win.\n\nBug 4: The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate. This will result in incorrect number of bribes required to win the election.",
