I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Limak is a grizzly bear who desires power and adoration. He wants to win in upcoming elections and rule over the Bearland.

There are n candidates, including Limak. We know how many citizens are going to vote for each candidate. Now i-th candidate would get a_{i} votes. Limak is candidate number 1. To win in elections, he must get strictly more votes than any other candidate.

Victory is more important than everything else so Limak decided to cheat. He will steal votes from his opponents by bribing some citizens. To bribe a citizen, Limak must give him or her one candy - citizens are bears and bears like candies. Limak doesn't have many candies and wonders - how many citizens does he have to bribe?


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) - number of candidates.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) - number of votes for each candidate. Limak is candidate number 1.

Note that after bribing number of votes for some candidate might be zero or might be greater than 1000.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of citizens Limak must bribe to have strictly more votes than any other candidate.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
5 1 11 2 8

Output
4

Input
4
1 8 8 8

Output
6

Input
2
7 6

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak has 5 votes. One of the ways to achieve victory is to bribe 4 citizens who want to vote for the third candidate. Then numbers of votes would be 9, 1, 7, 2, 8 (Limak would have 9 votes). Alternatively, Limak could steal only 3 votes from the third candidate and 1 vote from the second candidate to get situation 9, 0, 8, 2, 8.

In the second sample Limak will steal 2 votes from each candidate. Situation will be 7, 6, 6, 6.

In the third sample Limak is a winner without bribing any citizen.
### Requirements

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#

    max_votes = max(other_votes)

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5
5 1 11 2 8
" the output was "7
" but the expected output was "4
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are some bugs in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The function `minimum_bribes` assumes that Limak is always the first candidate (candidate number 1). However, it is not necessary that Limak is always in the first position. The code should find the index of Limak instead of assuming it is the first candidate.

2. The calculation for `bribes` is incorrect. The current formula calculates the difference between the maximum votes of the other candidates and Limak's votes, and then adds 1 to it. However, it should instead calculate the difference between the maximum votes and Limak's votes, and then only add 1 to it if the difference is positive. The reason for this is that if Limak already has more votes than the maximum of the other candidates, no bribes are required.

3. The code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes. In this case, Limak cannot win by bribing citizens. The code should handle this case separately and return 0 if there is a tie for the maximum votes.

4. The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate. In this case, no bribes are required and the code should return 0.

### BUGS

Bug 1: The function assumes Limak is always the first candidate.

Bug 2: The calculation for `bribes` is incorrect.

Bug 3: The code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes.

Bug 4: The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate.

### IMPACT

Bug 1: Since the code assumes Limak is always the first candidate, it will give incorrect results if Limak is not the first. This will lead to incorrect number of bribes required to win the election.

Bug 2: The incorrect calculation for `bribes` will lead to incorrect number of bribes required to win the election. This could result in incorrect results or a higher number of bribes than necessary.

Bug 3: Since the code does not handle the case where there is a tie for the maximum votes, it will not produce the correct output in such cases. The code will give incorrect results and may suggest bribes even when it is not possible for Limak to win.

Bug 4: The code does not handle the case where Limak already has more votes than any other candidate. This will result in incorrect number of bribes required to win the election.

### BUGFIX
Here is the corrected code:

```python
def minimum_bribes(n, votes):
    limak_index = votes.index(max(votes))  # Find the index of Limak
    limak_votes = votes[limak_index]
    other_votes = votes[:limak_index] + votes[limak_index+1:]
    max_votes = max(other_votes)
    
    if limak_votes > max_votes or votes.count(max_votes) > 1:
        return 0
    
    bribes = max_votes - limak_votes + 1 if max_votes - limak_votes > 0 else 0
    
    return bribes

n = int(input())
votes = list(map(int, input().split()))

bribes_required = minimum_bribes(n, votes)
print(bribes_required)
```

### Explanation
1. Use the `index()` function to find the index of Limak in the list of votes. This will dynamically determine Limak's position in the list, instead of assuming Limak is the first candidate.
2. Instead of using slicing, split the list of votes into two parts: Limak's votes and the other candidates' votes. Use the index of Limak to split the list.
3. Update the condition for checking if bribes are required. Check if Limak's votes are already greater than the maximum votes or if there is a tie for the maximum votes (`votes.count(max_votes) > 1`).
4. Update the calculation for `bribes` to only add 1 if the difference between the maximum votes and Limak's votes is positive (`max_votes - limak_votes > 0`). This will prevent unnecessary addition of 1 when Limak already has more votes than any other candidate.
