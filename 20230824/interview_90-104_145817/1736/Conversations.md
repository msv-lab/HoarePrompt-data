I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
When Valera has got some free time, he goes to the library to read some books. Today he's got t free minutes to read. That's why Valera took n books in the library and for each book he estimated the time he is going to need to read it. Let's number the books by integers from 1 to n. Valera needs a_{i} minutes to read the i-th book.

Valera decided to choose an arbitrary book with number i and read the books one by one, starting from this book. In other words, he will first read book number i, then book number i + 1, then book number i + 2 and so on. He continues the process until he either runs out of the free time or finishes reading the n-th book. Valera reads each book up to the end, that is, he doesn't start reading the book if he doesn't have enough free time to finish reading it. 

Print the maximum number of books Valera can read.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9) — the number of books and the number of free minutes Valera's got. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4), where number a_{i} shows the number of minutes that the boy needs to read the i-th book.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of books Valera can read.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 5
3 1 2 1

Output
3

Input
3 3
2 2 3

Output
1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
