I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Vlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafes n times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.

First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.


-----Input-----

In first line there is one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.

In second line, n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2·10^5) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 3 2 1 2

Output
3

Input
6
2 1 2 2 4 1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices 1 and 2 were after the last visit to cafe with index 3; so this cafe is the answer. 

In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices 1, 2 and 4. Cafes with indices 1 and 4 were visited after the last visit of cafe with index 2, so the answer is 2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

In first line there is one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.

In second line, n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2·10^5) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.

Output
3

Input
6
2 1 2 2 4 1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices 1 and 2 were after the last visit to cafe with index 3; so this cafe is the answer. 

In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices 1, 2 and 4. Cafes with indices 1 and 4 were visited after the last visit of cafe with index 2, so the answer is 2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
n = int(input())
cafes = list(map(int, input().split()))

last_index = {}
result = None

for cafe in cafes:
    last_index[cafe] = cafes.index(cafe)

max_index = -1
for cafe in last_index:
    if last_index[cafe] > max_index:
        max_index = last_index[cafe]
        result = cafe

print(result)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5
1 3 2 1 2
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "3
".

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5

" the output was "2

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The provided code is attempting to find the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible. However, there are several bugs in the code that are causing incorrect results.

#### Bug 1: Incorrectly assigning the last index of each cafe
In the first for loop, the code is incorrectly assigning the last index of each cafe. It uses the `index()` method to find the index of each cafe in the `cafes` list. However, the `index()` method returns the **first** occurrence of the value, not the last occurrence. So, the last index stored for each cafe will be incorrect.

#### Bug 2: Incorrectly updating the maximum index
In the second for loop, the code is trying to find the maximum index among the last indices of each cafe. However, it is comparing the index of each cafe with `max_index`, which is initially set to -1. This means that the first cafe encountered will always be considered the cafe with the maximum index, which is incorrect.

#### Bug 3: Incorrectly updating the result
The code assigns the cafe with the maximum index to `result`, but it does not check if that cafe has already been visited before. This means that the cafe with the maximum index could be a cafe that Vlad has visited recently, violating the requirement of finding a cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.

#### Bug 4: Index out of range error
The code assumes that the indices of cafes will be in the range from 0 to 200,000. However, there is no validation or check for out-of-range indices. If a cafe index exceeds this range, it will cause an error.

#### Inefficient use of data structures
The code uses a dictionary `last_index` to store the last index of each cafe, but it also checks the maximum index while iterating over this dictionary. This is an inefficient use of data structures because we can directly find the maximum value without having to store all the last indices.
