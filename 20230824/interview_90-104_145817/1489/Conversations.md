I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given n distinct points on a plane with integral coordinates. For each point you can either draw a vertical line through it, draw a horizontal line through it, or do nothing.

You consider several coinciding straight lines as a single one. How many distinct pictures you can get? Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of points.

n lines follow. The (i + 1)-th of these lines contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} ( - 10^9 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 10^9) — coordinates of the i-th point.

It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible distinct pictures modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2

Output
16

Input
2
-1 -1
0 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two vertical and two horizontal lines passing through the points. You can get pictures with any subset of these lines. For example, you can get the picture containing all four lines in two ways (each segment represents a line containing it). The first way:   [Image]   The second way:   [Image] 

In the second example you can work with two points independently. The number of pictures is 3^2 = 9.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
" the output was "15
" but the expected output was "16
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Bugs in the Code

1. The code counts the number of *unique* x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the given points. However, this doesn't correctly account for the fact that for each point, we can draw either a vertical line, a horizontal line, or no line at all. Therefore, the number of possible line combinations for each x-coordinate and y-coordinate is actually 3, not 1.

2. The line `result = pow(2, x_count + y_count, mod) - 1` calculates the total number of possible line combinations, but it subtracts 1 at the end. There is no explanation or justification for this subtraction, and it appears to be incorrect. We should not subtract anything from the total count.

## Impact on Program's Functionality

The bugs in the code result in incorrect calculations for the number of possible distinct pictures. As a result, the program produces incorrect output for the given inputs.

For example, in the first example input `(4, [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)])`, the expected output is `16`. However, the current code produces an output of `15`.

Similarly, in the second example input `(2, [(-1, -1), (0, 1)])`, the expected output is `9`. But the current code gives an output of `8`.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. The code should count the number of unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates, but additionally, it should multiply each count by `3` to account for the three possibilities for each coordinate.

2. The subtraction of `1` in the line `result = pow(2, x_count + y_count, mod) - 1` should be removed, as there is no reason to subtract anything. We want to calculate the total number of line combinations without any subtraction.
