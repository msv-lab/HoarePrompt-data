          "feedback": "## Bugs in the Code\n\n1. The code counts the number of *unique* x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the given points. However, this doesn't correctly account for the fact that for each point, we can draw either a vertical line, a horizontal line, or no line at all. Therefore, the number of possible line combinations for each x-coordinate and y-coordinate is actually 3, not 1.\n\n2. The line `result = pow(2, x_count + y_count, mod) - 1` calculates the total number of possible line combinations, but it subtracts 1 at the end. There is no explanation or justification for this subtraction, and it appears to be incorrect. We should not subtract anything from the total count.\n\n## Impact on Program's Functionality\n\nThe bugs in the code result in incorrect calculations for the number of possible distinct pictures. As a result, the program produces incorrect output for the given inputs.\n\nFor example, in the first example input `(4, [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)])`, the expected output is `16`. However, the current code produces an output of `15`.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example input `(2, [(-1, -1), (0, 1)])`, the expected output is `9`. But the current code gives an output of `8`.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. The code should count the number of unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates, but additionally, it should multiply each count by `3` to account for the three possibilities for each coordinate.\n\n2. The subtraction of `1` in the line `result = pow(2, x_count + y_count, mod) - 1` should be removed, as there is no reason to subtract anything. We want to calculate the total number of line combinations without any subtraction.",
