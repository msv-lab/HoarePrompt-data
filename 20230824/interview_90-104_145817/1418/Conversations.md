I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You're given an integer $n$. For every integer $i$ from $2$ to $n$, assign a positive integer $a_i$ such that the following conditions hold:  For any pair of integers $(i,j)$, if $i$ and $j$ are coprime, $a_i \neq a_j$.  The maximal value of all $a_i$ should be minimized (that is, as small as possible). 

A pair of integers is called coprime if their greatest common divisor is $1$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print $n-1$ integers, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq n$). 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4

Output
1 2 1 
Input
3

Output
2 1


-----Note-----

In the first example, notice that $3$ and $4$ are coprime, so $a_3 \neq a_4$. Also, notice that $a=[1,2,3]$ satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is $3$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

-----Note-----

In the first example, notice that $3$ and $4$ are coprime, so $a_3 \neq a_4$. Also, notice that $a=[1,2,3]$ satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is $3$.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

# Initialize list to store the values of a_i
a = [0] * (n-1)

# Assign values to a_i
for i in range(2, n+1):
    # Set the initial value as 1
    a[i-2] = 1
    
    # Check if i is a prime number
    is_prime = True
    for j in range(2, int(i**(1/2))+1):
        if i % j == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    
    # If i is prime, assign it a unique value
    if is_prime:
        a[i-2] = i

# Print the values of a_i
print(" ".join(str(x) for x in a))
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
" the output was "2 3 1
" but the expected output was "1 2 1 ".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
" the output was "2 3 1
" but the expected output was "1 2 1 ".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code that need to be fixed:

1. The code assigns values to `a_i` incorrectly. Instead of assigning a different value to `a_i` based on primality, the code assigns `a_i` the value of `i` if it is prime, and `1` otherwise. This violates the first condition mentioned in the problem statement, which states that for any pair of integers `(i,j)`, if `i` and `j` are coprime, `a_i` should not be equal to `a_j`.
2. The code incorrectly checks for primality. The loop that checks for primality iterates from `2` to the square root of `i`, but it should actually iterate from `2` to `i-1`. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when `i` is `2` correctly.
3. The code initializes `a` with `0` values, but the problem statement mentions that `a_i` should be a positive integer.

These bugs impact the functionality of the program by generating incorrect values for `a_i`, violating the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

### BUG FIX

Here's the updated code with the bugs fixed:

```python
# Read input
n = int(input())

# Initialize list to store the values of a_i
a = [0] * (n-1)

# Assign values to a_i
current_num = 1
for i in range(2, n+1):
    # Check if i is a prime number
    is_prime = True
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    
    # If i is prime, assign it a unique value
    if is_prime:
        a[i-2] = current_num
        current_num += 1
    else:
        a[i-2] = 1

# Print the values of a_i
print(" ".join(str(x) for x in a))
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. The code now initializes `current_num` as `1`. This variable will be used to assign unique values to prime numbers.
2. The loop that checks for primality now iterates from `2` to `i-1`, fixing the bug in the original code.
3. Inside the loop, if `i` is prime, it is assigned the value of `current_num` in the `a` list, and `current_num` is incremented by `1` to ensure uniqueness for the next prime number.
4. If `i` is not prime, it is assigned the value `1` in the `a` list.
5. Finally, the values of `a_i` are printed.

By making these changes, the code will now correctly assign values to `a_i` based on the conditions mentioned in the problem statement and produce the expected output.
