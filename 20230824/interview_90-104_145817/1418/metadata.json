Instead of assigning a different value to `a_i` based on primality, the code assigns `a_i` the value of `i` if it is prime, and `1` otherwise. This violates the first condition mentioned in the problem statement, which states that for any pair of integers `(i,j)`, if `i` and `j` are coprime, `a_i` should not be equal to `a_j`.\n2. The code incorrectly checks for primality. The loop that checks for primality iterates from `2` to the square root of `i`, but it should actually iterate from `2` to `i-1`. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when `i` is `2` correctly.\n3. The code initializes `a` with `0` values, but the problem statement mentions that `a_i` should be a positive integer.\n\nThese bugs impact the functionality of the program by generating incorrect values for `a_i`, violating the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.",
