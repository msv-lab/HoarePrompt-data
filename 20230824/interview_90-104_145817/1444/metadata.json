          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n\nThere are several bugs in the code provided.\n\n#### 1. Indexing Bug\nWhen finding the indices of the selected stations in the original list, the code uses `stations.index(station) + 1` to find the index. However, this will only find the index of the first occurrence of the station in the list, which may not be the correct index if there are duplicate stations. \n\n#### 2. Selection Bug\nThe code selects the `k-1` first stations from the sorted list, and then adds the last station from the sorted list. However, this does not ensure that the selected stations have the minimum average commute time. The code should instead consider all possible combinations of `k` stations and calculate the average commute time for each combination.\n\n#### 3. Coordinate Sorting Bug\nThe code sorts the stations by their coordinates using `sorted_stations = sorted(stations)`. However, this does not take into account their original order. The stations should instead be sorted with their original indices preserved.\n\n#### 4. Output Bug\nThe code returns the indices of the selected stations, but it does not guarantee that the indices are in ascending order. The output should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\nTo fix the bugs, the following changes need to be made:\n\n#### 1. Indexing Fix\nInstead of using `stations.index(station) + 1` to find the index of the station in the original list, we can use a dictionary to store the index of each station. This will allow us to find the index in constant time.\n\n#### 2. Selection Fix\nInstead of selecting the `k-1` first stations from the sorted list and adding the last station, we need to consider all possible combinations of `k` stations. We can use itertools.combinations to generate all combinations of stations, and calculate the average commute time for each combination.\n\n#### 3. Sorting Fix\nInstead of sorting the stations by their coordinates, we need to sort them with their original indices preserved. We can use the `enumerate` function to get the indices of the stations while sorting.\n\n#### 4. Output Fix\nTo ensure that the output is in ascending order, we can sort the selected stations before returning them.",
