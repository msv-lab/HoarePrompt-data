I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
A PIN code is a string that consists of exactly $4$ digits. Examples of possible PIN codes: 7013, 0000 and 0990. Please note that the PIN code can begin with any digit, even with 0.

Polycarp has $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10$) bank cards, the PIN code of the $i$-th card is $p_i$.

Polycarp has recently read a recommendation that it is better to set different PIN codes on different cards. Thus he wants to change the minimal number of digits in the PIN codes of his cards so that all $n$ codes would become different.

Formally, in one step, Polycarp picks $i$-th card ($1 \le i \le n$), then in its PIN code $p_i$ selects one position (from $1$ to $4$), and changes the digit in this position to any other. He needs to change the minimum number of digits so that all PIN codes become different.

Polycarp quickly solved this problem. Can you solve it?


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.

The first line of each of $t$ test sets contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10$) — the number of Polycarp's bank cards. The next $n$ lines contain the PIN codes $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ — one per line. The length of each of them is $4$. All PIN codes consist of digits only.


-----Output-----

Print the answers to $t$ test sets. The answer to each set should consist of a $n + 1$ lines

In the first line print $k$ — the least number of changes to make all PIN codes different. In the next $n$ lines output the changed PIN codes in the order corresponding to their appearance in the input. If there are several optimal answers, print any of them.


-----Example-----

### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs and logical errors in the provided code that are causing incorrect results. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The bug occurs in the nested loop that checks for duplicate PIN codes. Currently, the program incorrectly counts and changes PIN codes with the same value in the last digit. This is because the code uses `pin[:3]` to retrieve the first three digits of the PIN code, but this should actually be `pin[:i]` to include the digit being changed. This bug leads to incorrect PIN code changes and counts.

2. Another bug occurs when updating the `pin_counts` dictionary. The code currently increments the count for duplicate PIN codes before checking if the code is already in the dictionary. This results in incorrect counts for duplicate PIN codes, as the initial count for a PIN code should be 0, not 1. Additionally, the code does not correctly update the count for the original PIN code after changing it (inside the nested loop). This leads to incorrect counts and duplicate PIN codes not being changed.

3. The code does not handle the case when the PIN code change results in another duplicate PIN code. This leads to incorrect results as the program does not find a unique PIN code.

4. The code unnecessarily calculates and prints the number of changes (`changes`) before changing the PIN codes. This leads to the incorrect output of the number of changes.

### BUGS AND IMPACT

Bug 1: Incorrectly changing PIN codes and counts for duplicates.

Impact: This bug leads to incorrect PIN code changes and incorrect counts for duplicate PIN codes. If there are repeated PIN codes, changing a digit will not always result in a unique PIN code. This bug leads to incorrect values in the `pin_counts` dictionary and incorrect output PIN codes.

Bug 2: Incorrectly updating the `pin_counts` dictionary.

Impact: This bug leads to incorrect counts for duplicate PIN codes. The initial count for a PIN code should be 0, not 1. Additionally, the code does not correctly update the count for the original PIN code after changing it. This results in incorrect counts and duplicate PIN codes not being changed.

Bug 3: Not handling cases where the PIN code change results in another duplicate PIN code.

Impact: This bug leads to incorrect results as the program does not find a unique PIN code. If changing a digit in a PIN code results in another duplicate PIN code, the program should continue changing the digit until a unique PIN code is obtained.

Bug 4: Incorrectly calculating and printing the number of changes.

Impact: This bug leads to the incorrect output of the number of changes. The program calculates and prints the number of changes before actually changing the PIN codes. As a result, the output number of changes does not reflect the actual number of changes made.

### RECOMMENDATION

Based on the analysis above, here are the recommendations for fixing the bugs in the code:

1. Update the nested loop that checks for duplicate PIN codes:
   - Change `pin[:3]` to `pin[:i]` to include the digit being changed.
   - Update the count for the original PIN code after changing it.

2. Correctly update the `pin_counts` dictionary:
   - Set the initial count for a PIN code as 0.
   - Update the count for the original PIN code after changing it.

3. Handle cases where the PIN code change results in another duplicate PIN code:
   - Keep changing the digit until a unique PIN code is obtained.

4. Calculate and print the number of changes after changing the PIN codes:
   - Move the calculation and printing of the number of changes after changing the PIN codes.

By implementing these recommendations, the code should be able to correctly count and change the minimum number of digits to make all PIN codes different.
