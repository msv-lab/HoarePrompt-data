I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Pixels in a digital picture can be represented with three integers in the range $0$ to $255$ that indicate the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. To compress an image or to create an artistic effect, many photo-editing tools include a “posterize” operation which works as follows. Each color channel is examined separately; this problem focuses only on the red channel. Rather than allow all integers from $0$ to $255$ for the red channel, a posterized image allows at most $k$ integers from this range. Each pixel’s original red intensity is replaced with the nearest of the allowed integers. The photo-editing tool selects a set of $k$ integers that minimizes the sum of the squared errors introduced across all pixels in the original image. If there are $n$ pixels that have original red values $r_1, \ldots , r_ n$, and $k$ allowed integers $v_1, \ldots , v_ k$, the sum of squared errors is defined as\[ \sum _{i=1}^n \min _{1 \leq j \leq k} (r_ i - v_ j)^2. \]

Your task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of squared errors, given parameter $k$ and a description of the red intensities of an image’s pixels.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two integers $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 256$), the number of distinct red values that occur in the original image, and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq d$), the number of distinct red values allowed in the posterized image. The remaining $d$ lines indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red values. Each such line contains two integers $r$ ($0 \leq r \leq 255$) and $p$ ($1 \leq p \leq 2^{26}$), where $r$ is a red intensity value and $p$ is the number of pixels having red intensity $r$. Those $d$ lines are given in increasing order of red value.

-----Output-----
Display the sum of the squared errors for an optimally chosen set of $k$ allowed integer values.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
2 1
50 20000
150 10000
Sample Output 1:
66670000

Sample Input 2:
2 2
50 20000
150 10000
Sample Output 2:
0
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

50 20000

" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "66670000
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Bug 1: Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Squared Error

In the inner loop, the code calculates the minimum sum of squared errors for each allowed red value $i$. However, the calculation of the minimum squared error is incorrect. The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + p * (r - red_values[0][0]) ** 2)` should be modified to calculate the correct value.

Instead of using `red_values[0][0]` as the reference red value, we should use the actual allowed red value `red_values[i-1][0]`. This is because `red_values[0][0]` represents the first red value in the input, not the red value corresponding to the current allowed value.

### Bug 2: Incorrect Loop Iteration

The inner loop iterates over the `red_values` list, which contains the red values and their corresponding pixel counts. However, in the calculation of squared error, the code incorrectly uses `p` as the pixel count. The variable `p` actually represents the number of pixels having red intensity `r`, not the pixel count for each red value. The correct variable to use is `p[i-1][1]`.

### Bug 3: Incorrect Initialization of Minimum Squared Errors

The code initializes the `dp` list with infinity values using `dp = [math.inf] * (k + 1)`. However, this initialization is incorrect because the sum of squared errors can be zero if `k` is larger than the number of distinct red values `d`. In this case, the minimum sum of squared errors would be zero because all red values can be included without any approximation.

To fix this bug, the initialization should be modified to consider the case where `k` is larger than `d`. If `k` is larger than or equal to `d`, the minimum sum of squared errors would be zero, so the initialization should set `dp[d]` to zero.

### Impact on Program's Functionality

These bugs result in incorrect calculation of the minimum achievable sum of squared errors. The incorrect calculation may lead to unexpected results and incorrect optimization of the allowed red values. The program may produce incorrect outputs for different input scenarios, leading to inaccurate analysis or visual representations of the image. The bugs may also cause the program to crash or produce runtime errors due to incorrect array indexing or calculations.
