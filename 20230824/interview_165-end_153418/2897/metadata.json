          "feedback": "## Observations:\n\nThe code provided is intended to check if it is possible for a binary or decimal user to move between two locations on a given map. \n\n### Bugs:\n1. `map` is a built-in keyword in Python, so it is not a good practice to use it as a variable name. I will rename it to \"mymap\" to avoid any conflicts with the built-in function.\n2. There is a type error on line 15. The code is mistakenly using the `list` function instead of the `input` function.\n3. The function `check_route` is returning the result immediately after the first query match. This means that it will not check if there is any other possible route between the locations. I will need to modify the code to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.\n4. The code is using 1-based indexing for the inputs, but the correct indexing should be 0-based.\n\n### Impact on Program:\n\nThese bugs can cause the program to produce incorrect results or throw errors.\n\n## Bugs in Detail:\n\n### Bug 1: Variable name conflict with the built-in `map` function.\nThe variable name `map` is used to store the input map, but `map` is a built-in function in Python. I will rename the variable to `mymap` to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Bug 2: TypeError on line 15.\nThe code is mistakenly using the `list` function instead of the `input` function on line 15. This leads to a `TypeError` as a result of calling `list` on `map(int, input().split())`. I will replace `list` with `input` to fix the error.\n\n### Bug 3: Checking only the first query match.\nThe `check_route` function checks the first query match and returns the result. This means that it will not check if there is any other possible route between the locations. I will modify the code to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.\n\n### Bug 4: Incorrect indexing of the map and queries.\nThe code assumes 1-based indexing for map and queries, but Python uses 0-based indexing. I will subtract 1 from the indices to fix this bug.\n\n## Solution Plan:\n1. Rename the variable `map` to `mymap`.\n2. Replace `list` with `input` on line 15.\n3. Modify the `check_route` function to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.\n4. Subtract 1 from the indices in the `check_route` function to account for 0-based indexing.\n\n## Revised Code:",
