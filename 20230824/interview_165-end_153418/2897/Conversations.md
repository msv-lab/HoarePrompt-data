I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The world is made up of $10$ kinds of people, those who understand binary and those who do not. These different kinds of people do not always get along so well. Bob might ask for a $10000$ ounce coffee (meaning binary) and Alice might make misinterpret his request as being in decimal and give him a $10011100010000$ ounce coffee (binary). After Sue explains that this much coffee costs $100$ dollars (decimal), Bob might assume he only has to pay $4$ dollars (interpreting the price as being in binary). In response to these differences that are difficult to resolve, these two groups have divided the world into two regions, the binary-friendly zones and the decimal-friendly zones. They have even published a map like the following to help people keep up with where the areas are (they have used ones and zeros so nobody would have trouble reading it).1111100000

Users of binary have to stay in the zones marked with a zero. Users of decimal have to stay in the zones marked with a one. You have to figure out if it is possible for either type of person to get between various locations of interest. People can move north, south, east or west, but cannot move diagonally.

-----Input-----
Input starts with a line containing two positive integers, $1 \le r \le 1000$ and $1 \le c \le 1000$. The next $r$ input lines give the contents of the map, each line containing exactly $c$ characters (which are all chosen from $0$ or $1$).

The next line has an integer $0 \le n \le 1000$. The following $n$ lines each contain one query, given as four integers: $r_1,c_1$ and $r_2,c_2$. These two pairs indicate two locations on the map, and their limits are $1 \le r_1, r_2 \le r$ and $1 \le c_1, c_2 \le c$.

-----Output-----
For each query, output binary if a binary user can start from location $r_1, c_1$ and move to location $r_2, c_2$. Output decimal if a decimal user can move between the two locations. Otherwise, output neither.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
1 4
1100
2
1 1 1 4
1 1 1 1
Sample Output:
neither
decimal
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Observations:

The code provided is intended to check if it is possible for a binary or decimal user to move between two locations on a given map. 

### Bugs:
1. `map` is a built-in keyword in Python, so it is not a good practice to use it as a variable name. I will rename it to "mymap" to avoid any conflicts with the built-in function.
2. There is a type error on line 15. The code is mistakenly using the `list` function instead of the `input` function.
3. The function `check_route` is returning the result immediately after the first query match. This means that it will not check if there is any other possible route between the locations. I will need to modify the code to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.
4. The code is using 1-based indexing for the inputs, but the correct indexing should be 0-based.

### Impact on Program:

These bugs can cause the program to produce incorrect results or throw errors.

## Bugs in Detail:

### Bug 1: Variable name conflict with the built-in `map` function.
The variable name `map` is used to store the input map, but `map` is a built-in function in Python. I will rename the variable to `mymap` to avoid conflicts.

### Bug 2: TypeError on line 15.
The code is mistakenly using the `list` function instead of the `input` function on line 15. This leads to a `TypeError` as a result of calling `list` on `map(int, input().split())`. I will replace `list` with `input` to fix the error.

### Bug 3: Checking only the first query match.
The `check_route` function checks the first query match and returns the result. This means that it will not check if there is any other possible route between the locations. I will modify the code to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.

### Bug 4: Incorrect indexing of the map and queries.
The code assumes 1-based indexing for map and queries, but Python uses 0-based indexing. I will subtract 1 from the indices to fix this bug.

## Solution Plan:
1. Rename the variable `map` to `mymap`.
2. Replace `list` with `input` on line 15.
3. Modify the `check_route` function to check all the queries and return the result accordingly.
4. Subtract 1 from the indices in the `check_route` function to account for 0-based indexing.

Here's the revised code with the bug fixes:

```python
def check_route(r, c, mymap, n, queries):
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        r1, c1, r2, c2 = query
        if mymap[r1-1][c1-1] == mymap[r2-1][c2-1]:
            result = "binary" if mymap[r1-1][c1-1] == '0' else "decimal"
        else:
            result = "neither"
        results.append(result)
    return results

r, c = map(int, input().split())
mymap = []
for _ in range(r):
    mymap.append(input())
n = int(input())
queries = []
for _ in range(n):
    query = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries.append(query)

results = check_route(r, c, mymap, n, queries)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

The code should now work correctly and produce the expected output.
