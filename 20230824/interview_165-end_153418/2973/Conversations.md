I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Sheila is a student and she drives a typical student car: it is old, slow, rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle on the speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she might have placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads $s$, her true speed is $s+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant (possibly negative). 

Sheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to use this to compute $c$. The journey consisted of $n$ segments. In the $i^{\text {th}}$ segment she traveled a distance of $d_ i$ and the speedometer read $s_ i$ for the entire segment. This whole journey took time $t$. Help Sheila by computing $c$.

Note that while Sheila’s speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of sections in Sheila’s journey, and $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^6$), the total time. This is followed by $n$ lines, each describing one segment of Sheila’s journey. The $i^{\text {th}}$ of these lines contains two integers $d_ i$ ($1 \le d_ i \le 1000$) and $s_ i$ ($|s_ i| \le 1000$), the distance and speedometer reading for the $i^{\text {th}}$ segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour.

-----Output-----
Display the constant $c$ in miles per hour. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3 5
4 -1
4 0
10 3
Sample Output:
3.000000000
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the given code that are causing the incorrect output.

#### 1. Incorrect Formula:
In the given code, the formula used to calculate the constant `c` is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate `c` is:
```
c = (distance - t * speed) / t
```
However, in the given code, the formula used is:
```
c = (distance - speed) / t
```
This is causing the incorrect value of `c` to be calculated and hence the incorrect output.

#### 2. Accumulating Speed Values:
The code is incorrectly accumulating the speed values for each segment without taking into account the time taken for that segment. Instead of adding the speed of each segment to the total speed, the code should be adding the distance divided by time for each segment to the total speed. This will give the correct average speed.

#### 3. Incorrect Output Format:
The code is not printing the output with the required precision. The output should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$. But the code is printing the output with default formatting, which may cause more decimal places to be displayed.

### CORRECTED CODE
Here's the corrected code:

```python
n, t = map(int, input().split())

distance = 0
total_time = 0
for _ in range(n):
    d, s = map(int, input().split())
    distance += d
    total_time += d / s

c = (distance - t * total_time) / t

print("{:.9f}".format(c))
```

In the corrected code:
1. We fixed the formula to calculate `c` by using the correct formula: `(distance - t * total_time) / t`.
2. We changed the variable name from `speed` to `total_time` to more accurately represent the accumulated time taken for each segment.
3. Instead of accumulating the speed values, we are now accumulating the time taken for each segment by dividing the distance by the speed (`d / s`).
4. We added the required formatting to print the output with 9 decimal places using the `"{:.9f}".format(c)` string formatting method.

Now the code should produce the correct output with the required precision.
