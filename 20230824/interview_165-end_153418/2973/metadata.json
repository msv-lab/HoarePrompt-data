Incorrect Formula:\nIn the given code, the formula used to calculate the constant `c` is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate `c` is:\n```\nc = (distance - t * speed) / t\n```\nHowever, in the given code, the formula used is:\n```\nc = (distance - speed) / t\n```\nThis is causing the incorrect value of `c` to be calculated and hence the incorrect output.\n\n#### 2. Accumulating Speed Values:\nThe code is incorrectly accumulating the speed values for each segment without taking into account the time taken for that segment. Instead of adding the speed of each segment to the total speed, the code should be adding the distance divided by time for each segment to the total speed. This will give the correct average speed.\n\n#### 3. Incorrect Output Format:\nThe code is not printing the output with the required precision. The output should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$. But the code is printing the output with default formatting, which may cause more decimal places to be displayed.\n\n### BUGGED CODE",
