I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You have a string $s$ and you may modify it by making long swaps of its letters. Two letters can be swapped if their positions differ by at least $k$. That is, you may swap the $i$-th letter with the $j$-th letter in $s$ if $|i - j| \geq k$. Is it possible to sort all the letters in $s$ increasingly, if you are allowed to swap any number of times (possibly zero)?

-----Input-----
The first line has a string $s$ ($2 \leq |s| \leq 100$) and an integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq |s| - 1$), separated by a single space. The string $s$ consists of only lowercase letters.

-----Output-----
If it is possible to sort the letters increasingly, output “Yes”. Otherwise output “No”.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
prognova 4
Sample Output:
Yes
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "prognova 4
" the output was "No
" but the expected output was "Yes
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the code provided:

1. The function `can_sort_letters` does not correctly handle the case where a long swap is not possible. In this case, it continues to iterate over the `sorted_indices` list and attempts to perform a swap even if it is not possible. This results in incorrect swaps and a incorrect final sorted string.

2. The `sorted_indices` list is not updated correctly. The code appends the current index `i` to `sorted_indices` regardless of whether a swap is performed or not. This leads to incorrect indices being considered for swaps in subsequent iterations.

3. The code uses the `sorted` function to check if the string is sorted, but this is incorrect. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list, but the original string `s` is not modified. Therefore, comparing `sorted(s)` with `s` will always return false.

4. The input is read using `input` function, which reads input as a single string. However, the input format requires reading two separate values - the string `s` and the integer `k`. This needs to be fixed in order to correctly read the input.

### BUGS
1. The function `can_sort_letters` does not correctly handle the case where a long swap is not possible. In this case, it continues to iterate over the `sorted_indices` list and attempts to perform a swap even if it is not possible. This results in incorrect swaps and a incorrect final sorted string.

2. The `sorted_indices` list is not updated correctly. The code appends the current index `i` to `sorted_indices` regardless of whether a swap is performed or not. This leads to incorrect indices being considered for swaps in subsequent iterations.

3. The code uses the `sorted` function to check if the string is sorted, but this is incorrect. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list, but the original string `s` is not modified. Therefore, comparing `sorted(s)` with `s` will always return false.

4. The input is read using `input` function, which reads input as a single string. However, the input format requires reading two separate values - the string `s` and the integer `k`. This needs to be fixed in order to correctly read the input.

### IMPACT
These bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:

1. The incorrect handling of long swaps in the `can_sort_letters` function can result in incorrect swaps and an incorrect final sorted string. This can cause the program to output "No" even if it is actually possible to sort the letters.

2. The incorrect updating of `sorted_indices` can result in incorrect indices being considered for swaps in subsequent iterations. This can lead to incorrect swaps and an incorrect final sorted string.

3. The use of `sorted(s)` to check if the string is sorted will always return false, since the original string `s` is not modified. This will cause the program to output "No" even if the letters are actually sorted.

4. The incorrect reading of the input using `input` function will not correctly separate the string `s` and the integer `k`. This will cause incorrect values to be assigned to `s` and `k`, leading to incorrect program behavior.

To fix the bugs and implement the proposed solutions, the following changes need to be made to the code:

1. In the `can_sort_letters` function, remove the incorrect check for long swaps. Instead, we will create a new list `swappable_indices` that will store the indices of the letters that can be swapped. We will iterate over the `sorted_indices` list and check if a long swap is possible between the current index `i` and any index in `sorted_indices`. If so, we will append `i` to `swappable_indices`. After iterating over `sorted_indices`, we will update `sorted_indices` with the values in `swappable_indices`.

2. In the `can_sort_letters` function, fix the updating of `sorted_indices`. Instead of appending the current index `i` to `sorted_indices` regardless of whether a swap is performed or not, we will only append `i` if a swap is performed in the loop.

3. In the `can_sort_letters` function, fix the comparison between `sorted(s)` and `s`. Instead of using the `sorted` function, we will simply compare `s` with `sorted_s` (the sorted version of `s`).

4. Update the input reading code to correctly read the string `s` and the integer `k` separately.

Based on the proposed fixes, below is the updated Python code:

```python
def can_sort_letters(s, k):
    # Sort the string in increasing order
    sorted_s = sorted(s)
    
    # Create a list to keep track of the indices where the letters are sorted
    sorted_indices = []
    
    # Check if it is possible to sort the letters
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the letter is already at the correct position
        if s[i] == sorted_s[i]:
            sorted_indices.append(i)
            continue
        
        # Check if a long swap is possible
        swappable_indices = []
        for j in sorted_indices:
            if abs(i-j) >= k:
                # Swap the letters
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                sorted_indices.append(i)
                swappable_indices.append(i)
                break
        
        # Update sorted_indices with swappable_indices
        sorted_indices.extend(swappable_indices)
    
    # Check if all letters are sorted
    return s == sorted_s

# Read the input string and k value
s, k = input().split()
k = int(k)

# Check if it is possible to sort the letters
if can_sort_letters(list(s), k):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```
