I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Your friend Claire has dragged you along to a speedcubing event that is happening in Eindhoven. These events are all about solving the Rubik’s cube and similar twisty puzzles as quickly as possible. The attendants of the event can enter into various competitions based on the type and size of the puzzle, and there are even special competitions where the puzzles need to be solved one-handed or blindfolded. 

Claire is competing in the most popular competition: speedsolving the $3\times 3\times 3$ Rubik’s cube, pictured on the right. Each contestant needs to solve the cube five times, each time with a different random scramble. After all solves are completed, the best and the worst times are discarded and the final score is the average of the remaining three times. The contestant with the smallest final score wins.

Claire has done well in the competition so far and is among the contenders for the overall victory. All the other contestants have already finished their five solves, but Claire has one solve remaining. By looking at the final scores of the other contestants, she has deduced her own target final score. As long as her final score is less than or equal to this target score, she will be declared the overall winner. Is it possible for her to win the competition, and if so, what is the worst time she can have on her last solve in order to do so?

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
 - One line with four real numbers $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ and $t_4$, the times Claire got on her first four solves.
 - One line with a real number $t$, Claire’s target final score, the worst final score she can have in order to be declared the overall winner.

Each number is between $1$ and $20$, inclusive, and is given with exactly two decimal places.

-----Output-----
If it is not possible for Claire to win the event, output “impossible”. If she will win regardless of the time she gets on her last solve, output “infinite”. Otherwise, output the worst time she can have on her last solve in order to be declared the overall winner. Output the number to exactly two decimal places.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
6.38 7.20 6.95 8.11
7.53
Sample Output 1:
infinite

Sample Input 2:
6.38 7.20 6.95 8.11
6.99
Sample Output 2:
6.82
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. The calculation of `last_solve_time` is incorrect. It should be `last_solve_time = (n * target_score) - sum(times[0:n-1])`, but the current code calculates it as `last_solve_time = (n * target_score) - sum(times[0:n])`. This leads to incorrect results.

2. The comparison `if min_score <= target_score` should be `if min_score >= target_score`. If the minimum score is greater than or equal to the target score, Claire can win regardless of her last solve time, so the code should return "infinite". But the current code returns "impossible" instead.

3. The comparison `if max_score >= target_score` should be `if max_score <= target_score`. If the maximum score is less than or equal to the target score, Claire cannot win no matter what, so the code should return "impossible". But the current code returns "infinite" instead.

4. The initial comment states that Claire needs to solve the cube five times, but the variable `n` is set to 5 in the code. This seems correct. However, the comment later mentions discarding the best and worst times and calculating the average of the remaining three times. This doesn't match the code, which calculates the average of the best and worst times.

5. The code doesn't handle the case when the target score is equal to the minimum score. In this case, Claire can win regardless of her last solve time, so the code should return "infinite". But the current code doesn't account for this possibility.

### IMPACT

1. The incorrect calculation of `last_solve_time` can lead to incorrect worst time for Claire's last solve. This will result in an incorrect output.

2. The incorrect comparison in `if min_score <= target_score` and `if max_score >= target_score` can lead to incorrect determination of whether it's possible for Claire to win or not. This will result in an incorrect output.

3. The incorrect handling of the target score being equal to the minimum score can lead to an incorrect output when Claire can win regardless of her last solve time.

4. The mismatch between the initial comment and the code can cause confusion and potential misunderstanding of the requirements.

### SUGGESTED FIXES

1. Change `last_solve_time = (n * target_score) - sum(times[0:n])` to `last_solve_time = (n * target_score) - sum(times[0:n-1])`.

2. Change `if min_score <= target_score` to `if min_score >= target_score`.

3. Change `if max_score >= target_score` to `if max_score <= target_score`.

4. Add a condition to check if `min_score` is equal to `target_score` and return "infinite" in that case.

5. Update the initial comment to match the calculation of the final score.

### CORRECTED CODE

```python
def solve_puzzle(times, target_score):
    n = 5
    times.sort()
    min_score = sum(times[0:n-1]) / (n - 1)  # Average of the best 3 times
    
    if min_score >= target_score:
        return "infinite"  # Claire can win regardless of her last solve time
    
    max_score = sum(times[1:n]) / (n - 1)  # Average of the worst 3 times
    
    if max_score <= target_score:
        return "impossible"  # Claire cannot win no matter what
    
    # Calculate worst time for Claire's last solve
    last_solve_time = (n * target_score) - sum(times[0:n-1])
    return "{:.2f}".format(last_solve_time)


times = list(map(float, input().split()))
target_score = float(input())

result = solve_puzzle(times, target_score)
print(result)
```

Note: This corrected code only includes the fixes suggested above, but there may be additional improvements or optimizations that can be made to the code.
