I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The evil emperor Cactus has in his possession the Magic Keg and has flooded the Enchanted Forest! The Painter and the three little hedgehogs now have to return to the Beaver’s den where they will be safe from the water as quickly as possible!

The map of the Enchanted Forest consists of R rows and C columns. Empty fields are represented by ‘.’ characters, flooded fields by ‘*’ and rocks by ‘X’. Additionally, the Beaver’s den is represented by ‘D’ and the Painter and the three little hedgehogs are shown as ‘S’.

Every minute the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can move to one of the four neighbouring fields (up, down, left or right). Every minute the flood expands as well so that all empty fields that have at least one common side with a flooded field become flooded as well. Neither water nor the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can pass through rocks. Naturally, the Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot pass through flooded fields, and water cannot flood the Beaver’s den.

Write a program that will, given a map of the Enchanted Forest, output the shortest time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver’s den.

Note: The Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot move into a field that is about to be flooded (in the same minute).

-----Input-----
The first line of input will contain two positive integers, $R$ and $C$, smaller than or equal to $50$. The following $R$ lines will each contain $C$ characters (‘.’, ‘*’, ‘X’, ‘D’ or ‘S’). The map will contain exactly one ‘D’ character and exactly one ‘S’ character.

-----Output-----
Output the shortest possible time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver’s den. If this is impossible output the word “KAKTUS” on a line by itself.

Clarification of the second sample test below: The best they can do is to go along the lower border and then the left border, and get flooded one minute before reaching the den.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
3 3
D.*
...
.S.
Sample Output 1:
3

Sample Input 2:
3 3
D.*
...
..S
Sample Output 2:
KAKTUS
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
There are several bugs in the given code:

1. The indices of the start position `start` are being assigned incorrectly. Instead of `start = (graph.index(row), row.index('S'))`, it should be `start = (forest.index(row), row.index('S'))`.

2. The `bfs` function does not correctly handle the case where it is impossible to reach the den. If the queue becomes empty and the den has not been reached, the function should return -1 instead of 0.

3. The condition `graph[row][col] == 'D'` in the `bfs` function checks if the current node is the den, but it does not take into account the fact that the den cannot be flooded. The condition should be `graph[row][col] == 'D' and col != 0`.

4. The condition `graph[r][c] == 'D'` in the inner for loop of the `bfs` function incorrectly checks if the current node is the den. It should be `graph[r][c] == 'D' and c != 0`.

5. The start position should also be added to the visited set before entering the while loop.

6. The start position should be added to the queue as `(start, 1)` instead of `(start, 0)`.

7. The check for empty fields that have at least one common side with a flooded field is missing. This condition should be added to the inner for loop in the `bfs` function.

8. The input is not being read correctly. Instead of `R, C = map(int, input().split())`, it should be `R, C = map(int, input().strip().split())`.

9. The forest variable is unnecessary. The graph variable can be used directly.

10. The output for the case where it is impossible to reach the den should be "KAKTUS" instead of -1.

The issues identified in the code have been fixed. Here is the updated code:

```python
def bfs(graph, start):
    queue = [(start, 1)]
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)

    while queue:
        node, time = queue.pop(0)
        row, col = node

        if graph[row][col] == 'D' and col != 0:
            return time

        for r, c in [(row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1)]:
            if 0 <= r < len(graph) and 0 <= c < len(graph[0]) and (r, c) not in visited and graph[r][c] not in ['X', '*']:
                visited.add((r, c))
                queue.append(((r, c), time+1))
                if graph[r][c] == '.':
                    graph[r][c] = '*'

    return -1

R, C = map(int, input().strip().split())
graph = []
start = None
for _ in range(R):
    row = list(input().strip())
    if 'S' in row:
        start = (_, row.index('S'))
    graph.append(row)

time_needed = bfs(graph, start)
if time_needed == -1:
    print("KAKTUS")
else:
    print(time_needed)
```

Please note that the `_` in the line `start = (_, row.index('S'))` is a placeholder for the loop variable.
