I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Two kingdoms had been at war for a long time, until the emperor intervened to bring an end to the conflict. The territory in question comprises an $M$ by $N$ rectangular grid. At the emperor’s insistence, the two kings have withdrawn their troops until no two opposing troops are in adjacent squares of the map (adjacent being horizontal or vertical – diagonal is not considered).

The emperor proposes to designate certain squares of the map as neutral territory. Neither king will be allowed to move troops into those squares, and the emperor’s own forces will patrol them to be sure that both kings observe these rules.

The emperor is frugal and does not want to commit more soldiers to this effort than absolutely necessary. His generals have marked each square of the map with the number of soldiers required to secure that square. What remains is to choose which of those squares should be patrolled.

Write a program to determine the minimum number of soldiers that the emperor will need to be deploy to guarantee that the troops of one kingdom cannot move, in one or more steps, into squares occupied by the troops of the second kingdom (moving horizontally or vertically) without encountering the emperor’s own soldiers.

-----Input-----
Input begins with a line containing $2$ integers, $w$ and $h$, denoting the width and height of the map, where $1 \leq w, h \leq 40$.

This is followed by $h$ lines. Each line contains $w$ characters, left justified. These characters will be ‘A’ or ‘B’, designating a position held by king A or king B, or a single numeric digit, designating a currently unoccupied position that can be secured by the use of that number of soldiers. For example, a ‘2’ would indicate that two soldiers must be deployed to that square to secure it against passage of other troops. A ‘0’ indicates terrain that is impassible – the emperor need not commit soldiers there because the kingdom troops cannot pass through that square.

No ‘A’ will be adjacent, horizontally or vertically, to any ‘B’.

There will be at least one ‘A’ and one ‘B’ in the input.

-----Output-----
Print a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of soldiers that the emperor must deploy to guarantee that there is no open path between any ‘A’ position and any ‘B’ position, using any combination of horizontal or vertical moves.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
8 5
A11111AA
AA7B111A
111BB111
11BBB111
11BBB11B
Sample Output:
13
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "8 5

AA7B111A
111BB111
11BBB111
11BBB11B
" the output was "4
" but the expected output was "13
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            There are several bugs in the given code. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The code is missing the input prompt. The first line of the code should be `w, h = map(int, input().split())`.
2. The `min_soldiers` function takes three parameters, but the code is not correctly passing the input to the function. The line `print(min_soldiers(w, h, grid))` should be outside the function, after the prompt.
3. The code is using the variable `INF` to initialize the variable `ans`, but it is never defined. `INF` should be defined as a large number, such as `INF = float('inf')`.
4. The horizontal and vertical movements are not correctly implemented. The code uses the `dirs` variable to define the possible movements, but it is not correctly used later in the code. The correct way to do this is to check all four possible directions: `(1, 0)` for moving down, `(-1, 0)` for moving up, `(0, 1)` for moving right, and `(0, -1)` for moving left.
5. The `bfs` function is missing the `count += 1` before the condition `if grid[x][y] == 'B'`. This means that the count will not be incremented if the current square is 'B', resulting in an incorrect count.
6. The `bfs` function is incorrectly updating the `soldiers` variable. Instead of updating `soldiers` only if `grid[x][y].isdigit() and int(grid[x][y]) > soldiers`, it should be updated if `grid[x][y].isdigit() and int(grid[x][y]) > soldiers_needed`.
7. The `bfs` function is incorrectly updating the `visited` variable. Instead of updating `visited[x][y]`, it should update `visited[nx][ny]`.
8. The `bfs` function is not correctly checking if a square should be visited. The condition `if grid[nx][ny] == 'A' or grid[nx][ny] == 'B' or int(grid[nx][ny]) <= soldiers` should be `if grid[nx][ny] == 'A' or grid[nx][ny] == 'B' or (grid[nx][ny].isdigit() and int(grid[nx][ny]) <= soldiers)`.
9. In the main function, the condition `if grid[nx][ny] == 'A': break` should be `if grid[nx][ny] == 'A' or grid[nx][ny] == 'B': break`.
10. In the main function, inside the nested loop, a new `visited` matrix should be created before calling the `bfs` function. The line `visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]` should be moved outside the loop, before the `for dx, dy in dirs` line.

After fixing all these bugs, the code should produce the correct output.
