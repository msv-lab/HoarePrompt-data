I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Mafia is a social game played frequently by high school competitors in informatics on summer and winter camps and national competitions, usually very late at night, drinking various fruit sodas. This game is not about winning, it’s about los taking part, like in competitions.

To solve this task, you don’t need to know the rules of mafia: all you need to know is that some of the players are “mobsters” and the rest are “civilians”. The mobsters know who is who, but the civilians don’t. The civilians are trying to figure out who the mobsters are during the game.

In the current round of the game, out of $N$ surviving players so far, each one has accused exactly one other player saying that he is the mobster. The civilians were only guessing and the mobsters have accused civilians, pretending to know nothing.

Not knowing who the mobsters are, but knowing who accused whom, determine the maximum possible number of mobsters among these players!

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 500000$), the number of players. The players are labeled with integers from $1$ to $N$.

The $K$-th line of input, out of the following $N$ lines, contains the label of the player accused by the player $K$. (No player can accuse themselves).

-----Output-----
The first and only line of output must contain the maximum possible number of mobsters.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
3
2
1
1
Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Input 2:
3
2
3
1
Sample Output 2:
1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
The code provided has some bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. **Bug**: The code incorrectly assumes that the number of players will be provided in the first line of input. However, according to the problem statement, the first line contains the number of players. Solution: The code should first read the number of players and then process the accusations.

2. **Bug**: The code uses a dictionary `accused` to store the number of times each player is accused. However, the dictionary is not being used correctly. It is storing the number of times each accused player is accused, instead of storing the number of times each player is accused. Solution: The dictionary `accused` should store the number of times each player accuses someone else.

3. **Bug**: The code incorrectly assumes that no player can accuse themselves. However, according to the problem statement, it is possible for a player to accuse themselves. Solution: The code should handle the case where a player accuses themselves.

4. **Bug**: The code incorrectly determines the mobster count. It checks the maximum accusation count for each player, instead of checking if the accusation count is equal to the total number of players minus 1. Solution: The code should check if the accusation count is equal to the total number of players minus 1 to determine if a player is a mobster.

5. **Bug**: The code prints the mobster count as the output. However, it does not take into account the case where all players are civilians and no one is a mobster. Solution: The code should handle the case where all players are civilians and no one is a mobster.

Let's update the code to fix these bugs:
