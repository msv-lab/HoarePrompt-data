There is a typo in the code. The variable `visited` is misspelled as `visisted` when calculating the total shame.\n3. The calculation of the total shame is incorrect. It adds `100` times the number of visited airports minus `1`, but it should add `100` times the number of flights taken, which is one less than the number of visited airports.\n4. The function `calculate_distance` is missing the conversion of longitude to radians.\n\n### BUG 1: Undefined variable `airports`\n\nIn the Dijkstra's algorithm loop, the variable `airports` is used to iterate over neighboring airports, but it is not defined anywhere in the code. The correct variable to use is `dist`.\n\nTo fix this bug, replace the line:\n```python\nairport1, lat1, lon1 = airport\nairport2, lat2, lon2 = airports[v]\n```\nwith:\n```python\nairport1, lat1, lon1 = u, lat, lon\nairport2, lat2, lon2 = airport, dist[airport][0], dist[airport][1]\n```\n\n### BUG 2: Misspelled variable name `visisted`\n\nIn the calculation of the total shame, the variable `visited` is misspelled as `visisted`. This will result in a `NameError`.\n\nTo fix this bug, replace the line:\n```python\ntotal_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visisted) - 1)\n```\nwith:\n```python\ntotal_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)\n```\n\n### BUG 3: Incorrect calculation of total shame\n\nThe calculation of the total shame is incorrect. It adds `100` times the number of visited airports minus `1`, but it should add `100` times the number of flights taken, which is one less than the number of visited airports.\n\nTo fix this bug, replace the line:\n```python\ntotal_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)\n```\nwith:\n```python\ntotal_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)\n```\n\n### BUG 4: Missing conversion of longitude to radians\n\nIn the function `calculate_distance`, only the latitude values are converted to radians, while the longitude values are not. This will result in incorrect distance calculations.\n\nTo fix this bug, replace the line:\n```python\nlon1 = lon1 * (math.pi / 180)\nlon2 = lon2 * (math.pi / 180)\n```\nwith:\n```python\nlon1 = math.radians(lon1)\nlon2 = math.radians(lon2)\n```",
