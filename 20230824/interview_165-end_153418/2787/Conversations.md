I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
At one of the many climate protests, Skylar fell in love with a fellow environmental activist. Unfortunately, the two young lovers live on opposite sides of the planet and long distance travel is only practical by (gasp) air. Skylar had scolded friends and family for flying, heavily handing out the recent Swedish export flygskam (verbatim translation: flight shame). But alas, the things we do for love! Now they want your help to calculate the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe. 

To calculate the best route you models the planet as a perfect sphere and assumes that all flights fly at the distance $6381$ km from the center of the earth. The amount of shame for a single point-to-point flight is calculated as the distance between the airports in km, plus a take-off and landing penalty of $100$, that is, two airports with the flight distance $1000$ km will result in $1100$ shame.

-----Latitude and longitude-----
The positions of the airports are given as the latitude and longitude in (decimal) degrees. The latitude of a point $P$ on the earths surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing through $P$ and the center of the earth. The equator has latitude $0^\circ $, points north of the equator has positive values and points south of the equator has negative values, the North Pole has latitude $90^\circ $ and the South Pole latitude $-90 ^\circ $. Half circles that run from the North to the South pole are called meridians. The zero meridian runs through Greenwich. The longitude of a point $Q$ is the angle between the zero meridian plane and the line that run through $Q$ and the center of the earth, with values from $- 180^\circ $ to $+180^\circ $, with positive values east of Greenwich.

-----Input-----
Input starts with one line with two integers $1 \leq N \leq 10000$, the number of airports and $1 \leq M \leq 100000$, the number of two-way flight routes. The second line has two strings $S$ and $T$, Skylar’s start position and Skylar’s target position. Then follows $N$ lines, each starts with a three letter (uppercase) airport code, followed by two real values numbers, the latitude and longitude in degrees. Then follows $M$ lines, each with two strings $a$ and $b$, the airports with a two-way flight connection.

All flight airports have unique names and all connections are between existing airports.

-----Output-----
Output a real value with the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will obtain on a one-way trip. If the target is unreachable and Skylar will be forever alone, output -1. Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted.

-----Examples-----

NameError: name 'airports' is not defined. Did you mean: 'airport'?
" but the expected output was "729.09706162045
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IN THE CODE

1. The variable `airports` is not defined, but it is used in the loop to iterate over neighboring airports in the Dijkstra's algorithm.
2. There is a typo in the code. The variable `visited` is misspelled as `visisted` when calculating the total shame.
3. The calculation of the total shame is incorrect. It adds `100` times the number of visited airports minus `1`, but it should add `100` times the number of flights taken, which is one less than the number of visited airports.
4. The function `calculate_distance` is missing the conversion of longitude to radians.

### BUG 1: Undefined variable `airports`

In the Dijkstra's algorithm loop, the variable `airports` is used to iterate over neighboring airports, but it is not defined anywhere in the code. The correct variable to use is `dist`.

To fix this bug, replace the line:
```python
airport1, lat1, lon1 = airport
airport2, lat2, lon2 = airports[v]
```
with:
```python
airport1, lat1, lon1 = u, lat, lon
airport2, lat2, lon2 = airport, dist[airport][0], dist[airport][1]
```

### BUG 2: Misspelled variable name `visisted`

In the calculation of the total shame, the variable `visited` is misspelled as `visisted`. This will result in a `NameError`.

To fix this bug, replace the line:
```python
total_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visisted) - 1)
```
with:
```python
total_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)
```

### BUG 3: Incorrect calculation of total shame

The calculation of the total shame is incorrect. It adds `100` times the number of visited airports minus `1`, but it should add `100` times the number of flights taken, which is one less than the number of visited airports.

To fix this bug, replace the line:
```python
total_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)
```
with:
```python
total_shame = dist[target] + 100 * (len(visited) - 1)
```

### BUG 4: Missing conversion of longitude to radians

In the function `calculate_distance`, only the latitude values are converted to radians, while the longitude values are not. This will result in incorrect distance calculations.

To fix this bug, replace the line:
```python
lon1 = lon1 * (math.pi / 180)
lon2 = lon2 * (math.pi / 180)
```
with:
```python
lon1 = math.radians(lon1)
lon2 = math.radians(lon2)
```
