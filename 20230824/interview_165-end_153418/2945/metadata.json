Input Parsing: The code does not accurately parse the input data.\n2. Variable Naming: The code uses variable names that are not intuitive and do not reflect their purpose.\n3. Calculation of Arrival Times: The code calculates the arrival times of the monkeys incorrectly.\n4. Minimum and Maximum Arrival Times: The code does not correctly determine the minimum and maximum arrival times for each type of monkey.\n5. Calculation of Result: The code calculates the result using incorrect variables.\n\nNow let's go through each bug in detail and discuss their impact on the program's functionality.",
