I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The local zoo has acquired a large open garden in which animals may freely move as in their natural habitats and entertain visitors with their usual shenanigans.

The most popular animals are monkeys. With their climbing and jumping and other skills, they delight old and young visitors alike.

One species of monkey has specialized in climbing tall trees and picking off coconuts. Another species has specialized in breaking them open.

There are $N$ monkeys of the first type (numbered 1 through $N$) and $M$ monkeys of the second type (numbered 1 through $M$).

Monkey $k$ of the first type takes $A_ k$ seconds to find a good spot on the tree, after which it picks off its first coconut. After that the monkey produces a new coconut every $B_ k$ seconds.

Monkey $k$ of the second type takes $C_ k$ seconds to find a good tool for opening the coconuts, after which it opens its first coconut. After that the monkey opens another coconut every $D_ k$ seconds.

Unfortunately, the second type of monkey is extremely aggressive so the two types may not be in the garden at the same time. Therefore, zoo keepers will chase away the first type of monkeys as soon as they have picked off all the coconuts. Similarly, if monkeys of the same type stay too long after opening all the coconuts, fights will ensue. Because of that, zoo keepers will send them away as soon as they have opened all the coconuts.

The zoo keepers first arrive immediately after all coconuts have been picked, and again immediately after the monkeys open them all. The time needed for monkeys to enter or leave the garden is also negligibly small.

Tomislav especially likes the second type of monkey, but can never guess when to arrive in order to see them. Help him calculate the time when the second type arrives if he knows the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, but does not know the number of coconuts in the garden.

-----Input-----
The first line contains the integer $T$ $(1 \leq T \leq 1000000000)$, the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, in seconds.

The next line contains the integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 100)$, the number of monkeys of the first type. Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $A_ k$ and $B_ k$ $(1 \leq A_ k, B_ k \leq 1000000000)$, how fast monkey $k$ of the first type is.

The next line contains the integer $M$ $(1 \leq M \leq 100)$, the number of monkeys of the second type. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $C_ k$ and $D_ k$ $(1 \leq C_ k, D_ k \leq 1000000000)$, how fast monkey $k$ of the second type is.

-----Output-----
Output the number of seconds between the arrival of the first type of monkeys and the arrival of the second type.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
12
1
3 1
1
5 1
Sample Output:
5

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "12

" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "5
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code above is intended to calculate the time between the arrival of the first type of monkeys and the arrival of the second type, given the total time that monkeys spent in the garden and the characteristics of each type of monkey.

Here are the identified bugs in the code:

1. Input Parsing: The code does not accurately parse the input data.
2. Variable Naming: The code uses variable names that are not intuitive and do not reflect their purpose.
3. Calculation of Arrival Times: The code calculates the arrival times of the monkeys incorrectly.
4. Minimum and Maximum Arrival Times: The code does not correctly determine the minimum and maximum arrival times for each type of monkey.
5. Calculation of Result: The code calculates the result using incorrect variables.

Now let's go through each bug in detail and discuss their impact on the program's functionality.

The first bug is with the input parsing. 

The code reads the total time monkeys spent in the garden, `T`, and the number of monkeys of the first and second types, `N` and `M`, respectively. However, it does not correctly parse the rest of the input data.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly parse the remaining input data. 

Here's the corrected code for input parsing:

```
T = int(input())
N = int(input())
monkeys_first_type = []
for _ in range(N):
    A, B = map(int, input().split())
    monkeys_first_type.append((A, B))

M = int(input())
monkeys_second_type = []
for _ in range(M):
    C, D = map(int, input().split())
    monkeys_second_type.append((C, D))
```

Now the code correctly parses the input data and stores the characteristics of each type of monkey in separate lists.

Let's move on to the next bug.

The second bug is with the variable naming.

The code uses variable names like `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` to represent the characteristics of each type of monkey. These variable names are not intuitive and do not reflect their purpose, which makes the code difficult to understand.

To fix this bug, we need to choose more descriptive variable names that indicate their meaning and purpose in the code.

Here's the corrected code with improved variable names:

```python
T = int(input())
N = int(input())
monkeys_first_type = []
for _ in range(N):
    time_find_spot, time_produce_coconut = map(int, input().split())
    monkeys_first_type.append((time_find_spot, time_produce_coconut))

M = int(input())
monkeys_second_type = []
for _ in range(M):
    time_find_tool, time_open_coconut = map(int, input().split())
    monkeys_second_type.append((time_find_tool, time_open_coconut))
```

Now the code uses more descriptive variable names that reflect the characteristics of each type of monkey.

Let's move on to the next bug.
