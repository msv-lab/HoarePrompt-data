I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Arthur and his sister Carol have been playing a game called Nim for some time now. Nim is played as follows:
 - The starting position has a number of heaps, all containing some, not necessarily equal, number of beads.
 - The players take turns chosing a heap and removing a positive number of beads from it.
 - The first player not able to make a move, loses.

Arthur and Carol really enjoyed playing this simple game until they recently learned an easy way to always be able to find the best move:
 - Xor the number of beads in the heaps in the current position (i.e., if we have $2$, $4$ and $7$ the xor-sum will be $1$ since $2\ \mathbf{xor}\ 4\ \mathbf{xor}\ 7 = 1$).
 - If the xor-sum is $0$, too bad, you will lose.
 - Otherwise, move such that the xor-sum becomes $0$. This is always possible.

It is quite easy to convince oneself that this works. Consider these facts:
 - The player that takes the last bead wins.
 - After the winning player’s last move the xor-sum will be $0$.
 - The xor-sum will change after every move.

Which means that if you make sure that the xor-sum always is $0$ when you have made your move, your opponent will never be able to win, and, thus, you will win.

Understandably it is no fun to play a game when both players know how to play perfectly (ignorance is bliss). Fortunately, Arthur and Carol soon came up with a similar game, $S$-Nim, that seemed to solve this problem. Each player is now only allowed to remove a number of beads in some predefined set $S$, e.g. if we have $S = \{ 2, 5\} $ each player is only allowed to remove $2$ or $5$ beads. Now it is not always possible to make the xor-sum $0$ and, thus, the strategy above is useless. Or is it?

Your job is to write a program that determines if a position of $S$-Nim is a losing or a winning position. A position is a winning position if there is at least one move to a losing position. A position is a losing position if there are no moves to a losing position. This means, as expected, that a position with no legal moves is a losing position.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains a number $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100$) describing the size of $S$, followed by $k$ numbers $s_ i$ ($1 \le s_ i \le 10000$) describing $S$. The second line contains a number $m$ ($1 \le m \le 100$) describing the number of positions to evaluate. The next $m$ lines each contain a number $l$ ($1 \le l \le 100$) describing the number of heaps and $l$ numbers $h_ i$ ($0 \le h_ i \le 10000$) describing the number of beads in the heaps.

-----Output-----
For each position:
 - If the described position is a winning position print a ‘W’.
 - If the described position is a losing position print an ‘L’.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
2 2 5
3
2 5 12
3 2 4 7
4 2 3 7 12
Sample Output:
LWW
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

Your job is to write a program that determines if a position of $S$-Nim is a losing or a winning position. A position is a winning position if there is at least one move to a losing position.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 2 5
3
2 5 12
3 2 4 7
4 2 3 7 12
" the output was "LLW
" but the expected output was "LWW
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code is attempting to determine whether each position in the game of $S$-Nim is a winning or losing position. It iterates through each position and calculates the xor-sum of the number of beads in each heap. If the xor-sum is equal to 0, it adds 'L' to the result list. Otherwise, it checks if there is at least one move to a losing position by trying out each bead removal option in the set $S$ and checking if the xor-sum decreases. If there is at least one move to a losing position, it adds 'L' to the result list. Otherwise, it adds 'W' to the result list.

After analyzing the code, I have identified several bugs:

1. The input values for $k$ (the size of the set $S$) and $m$ (the number of positions to evaluate) are not being used. The code is instead relying on the length of the input list for $S$ and the number of elements in the positions list.
2. The positions list is not being properly constructed. Instead of appending the heap sizes to the positions list, the code is appending the entire heap list.
3. The if condition in the inner loop is incorrect. Instead of checking if xor_sum ^ s is less than xor_sum, it should be checking if xor_sum ^ s equals 0.

These bugs have an impact on the program's functionality. The incorrect usage of the input values $k$ and $m$ means that the code is not processing the correct number of positions. The incorrect construction of the positions list means that the xor-sum is being calculated incorrectly. Finally, the incorrect if condition in the inner loop may cause incorrect determination of winning or losing positions.

Overall, these bugs need to be addressed in order for the program to produce the correct output.

### BUG FIX
To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Remove the unused input values $k$ and $m$.
2. Modify the loop that constructs the positions list to append the heap sizes instead of the entire heap list.
3. Change the if condition in the inner loop to check if xor_sum ^ s is equal to 0.

The modified code is shown below:

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE
```python
def winning_or_losing(S, positions):
    results = []
    for pos in positions:
        xor_sum = 0
        for num in pos:
            xor_sum ^= num
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append('L')
        else:
            losing = True
            for s in S:
                if xor_sum ^ s == 0:
                    losing = False
                    break
            if losing:
                results.append('L')
            else:
                results.append('W')
    return ''.join(results)

# Get input
k, *S = map(int, input().split())
m = int(input())
positions = []
for _ in range(m):
    l, *h = map(int, input().split())
    positions.append(h)

# Call the function and print the result
print(winning_or_losing(S, positions))
```
After making these changes, the code should correctly determine whether each position in the game of $S$-Nim is a winning or losing position.
