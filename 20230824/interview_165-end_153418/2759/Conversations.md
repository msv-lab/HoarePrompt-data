I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Mirko found a collection of $N$ toy tanks dating back to the Second World War on his grandfather’s attic. He promptly called his friend Slavko to play with him. They made a battlefield – a wooden board consisting of squares in $N$ rows and $N$ columns.

Each tank can be moved to one of the four neighbouring squares in a single move. A tank can shoot at any square in the same row and column. The tank is said to be guarding the row and column it is in.

Additionally, no two tanks can be in the same square at any time.

After many hours of play and two previous attempts, Mirko’s mom yelled at them to come down for lunch again, and they decided to rearrange the tanks so that each tank guards a different row and column (meaning also that each row and column contains only one tank).

However, they want to do this using the minimum number of moves.

Write a program that finds the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the tanks so that each row and each column contains a single tank, and one such shortest sequence of moves.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($3 \le N \le 500$).

Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \le R, S \le N$), the row and column of a single tank at the moment of mom’s call. No two tanks are on the same square.

Rows and columns are marked $1$ through $N$, top-down and left-to-right.

-----Output-----
Output the minimum number of moves (call this number $K$) on the first line.

Each of the next $K$ lines should contain the tank being moved and the direction it is moved in, separated by a single space.

Tanks are numbered $1$ through $N$, in the order in which they are given in the input.

The direction can be one of four uppercase letters: ‘L’ for left, ‘R’ for right, ‘U’ for up and ‘D’ for down.

If there are multiple optimal solutions, any one will be accepted.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
5
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
Sample Output 1:
10
1 D
2 D

4 3
Sample Output 2:
8
1 R
1 R
2 U

5 L
5 L
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. The code does not consider the case where there are no tanks to be moved.
2. The code incorrectly moves the tanks to the left ('L') instead of down ('D').
3. The code does not update the row and column mappings after moving tanks.

### BUG 1: No Consideration for No Tanks to be Moved
The code assumes that there will always be tanks to be moved, but this may not always be the case. If all rows and columns already have only one tank, there is no need to perform any moves. This case needs to be handled separately.

### BUG 2: Incorrect Movement Direction ('L' instead of 'D')
When there are more than one tank in a row, the code currently moves them to the left instead of moving them down. The correct movement should be down. 

### BUG 3: Missing Update of Row and Column Mappings
After moving tanks, the code does not update the row and column mappings to reflect the new positions of the tanks. This will lead the code to perform unnecessary moves and potentially incorrect moves.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Add a check at the beginning to determine if there are any tanks to be moved. If not, skip the move calculation and directly output the correct answer.
2. Update the movement command to move tanks down ('D') instead of left ('L').
3. Update the row and column mappings after moving tanks.

### IMPROVED CODE
```python
n = int(input())

# read the initial positions of the tanks
tanks = {}
for i in range(n):
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    tanks[(r, c)] = i + 1

# check if there are any tanks to be moved
if len(tanks) == n:
    print(0)
else:
    # initialize counters for the number of moves and the list of moves
    moves = 0
    move_list = []

    # create a mapping from rows and columns to the tanks in them
    row_tanks = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    col_tanks = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for pos, tank in tanks.items():
        r, c = pos
        row_tanks[r].add(tank)
        col_tanks[c].add(tank)

    # iterate through each row and column
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # if the row has more than one tank, move them all down
        if len(row_tanks[i]) > 1:
            for tank in row_tanks[i]:
                moves += 1
                move_list.append((tank, 'D'))
            # update the row and column mappings
            for tank in row_tanks[i]:
                row_tanks[i].remove(tank)
                row_tanks[i+1].add(tank)
        # if the column has more than one tank, move them all down
        if len(col_tanks[i]) > 1:
            for tank in col_tanks[i]:
                moves += 1
                move_list.append((tank, 'D'))
            # update the row and column mappings
            for tank in col_tanks[i]:
                col_tanks[i].remove(tank)
                col_tanks[i+1].add(tank)

    # print the number of moves and the move list
    print(moves)
    for move in move_list:
        print(move[0], move[1])
```

With these modifications, the code should correctly calculate the minimum number of moves and provide a valid sequence of moves to rearrange the tanks.

The code you provided has a few bugs that need to be fixed. 

1. The code doesn't handle the case where there are no tanks to be moved. In that case, the code should output 0 moves and no move list. 

2. The code incorrectly moves the tanks to the left instead of moving them down. The correct movement should be down ('D').

3. The code doesn't update the row and column mappings after moving tanks. This can result in incorrect moves being made.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())

# read the initial positions of the tanks
tanks = {}
for i in range(n):
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    tanks[(r, c)] = i + 1

# check if there are any tanks to be moved
if len(tanks) == n:
    print(0)
else:
    # initialize counters for the number of moves and the list of moves
    moves = 0
    move_list = []

    # create a mapping from rows and columns to the tanks in them
    row_tanks = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    col_tanks = {i: set() for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for pos, tank in tanks.items():
        r, c = pos
        row_tanks[r].add(tank)
        col_tanks[c].add(tank)

    # iterate through each row and column
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # if the row has more than one tank, move them all down
        if len(row_tanks[i]) > 1:
            for tank in row_tanks[i]:
                moves += 1
                move_list.append((tank, 'D'))
            # update the row and column mappings
            for tank in row_tanks[i]:
                row_tanks[i].remove(tank)
                row_tanks[i + 1].add(tank)
        # if the column has more than one tank, move them all down
        if len(col_tanks[i]) > 1:
            for tank in col_tanks[i]:
                moves += 1
                move_list.append((tank, 'D'))
            # update the row and column mappings
            for tank in col_tanks[i]:
                col_tanks[i].remove(tank)
                col_tanks[i + 1].add(tank)

    # print the number of moves and the move list
    print(moves)
    for move in move_list:
        print(move[0], move[1])
```

With these fixes, the code should correctly calculate the minimum number of moves and provide a valid sequence of moves to rearrange the tanks.
