I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
A star is a figure of the following type: an asterisk character '*' in the center of the figure and four rays (to the left, right, top, bottom) of the same positive length. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The size of a star must be a positive number (i.e. rays of length $0$ are not allowed).

Let's consider empty cells are denoted by '.', then the following figures are stars:

 [Image] The leftmost figure is a star of size $1$, the middle figure is a star of size $2$ and the rightmost figure is a star of size $3$. 

You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. Rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$. Your task is to draw this grid using any number of stars or find out that it is impossible. Stars can intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid. You can use stars of same and arbitrary sizes.

In this problem, you do not need to minimize the number of stars. Just find any way to draw the given grid with at most $n \cdot m$ stars.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \le n, m \le 1000$) — the sizes of the given grid.

The next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters each, the $i$-th line describes the $i$-th row of the grid. It is guaranteed that grid consists of characters '*' and '.' only.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to draw the given grid using stars only, print "-1".

Otherwise in the first line print one integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le n \cdot m$) — the number of stars needed to draw the given grid. The next $k$ lines should contain three integers each — $x_j$, $y_j$ and $s_j$, where $x_j$ is the row index of the central star character, $y_j$ is the column index of the central star character and $s_j$ is the size of the star. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

### QUESTION
A star is a figure of the following type: an asterisk character '*' in the center of the figure and four rays (to the left, right, top, bottom) of the same positive length. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The size of a star must be a positive number (i.e. rays of length $0$ are not allowed).

Let's consider empty cells are denoted by '.', then the following figures are stars:

 [Image] The leftmost figure is a star of size $1$, the middle figure is a star of size $2$ and the rightmost figure is a star of size $3$. 

You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$ consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. Rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$. Your task is to draw this grid using any number of stars or find out that it is impossible. Stars can intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. The number of stars in the output can't exceed $n \cdot m$. Each star should be completely inside the grid. You can use stars of same and arbitrary sizes.

In this problem, you do not need to minimize the number of stars. Just find any way to draw the given grid with at most $n \cdot m$ stars.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \le n, m \le 1000$) — the sizes of the given grid.

The next $n$ lines contains $m$ characters each, the $i$-th line describes the $i$-th row of the grid. It is guaranteed that grid consists of characters '*' and '.' only.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to draw the given grid using stars only, print "-1".

Otherwise in the first line print one integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le n \cdot m$) — the number of stars needed to draw the given grid. The next $k$ lines should contain three integers each — $x_j$, $y_j$ and $s_j$, where $x_j$ is the row index of the central star character, $y_j$ is the column index of the central star character and $s_j$ is the size of the star. Each star should be completely inside the grid.

is also correct.

Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)

" the output was "1
3 4 1
" but the expected output was "2
3 4 1
3 5 2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the code. 

1. The loop indices in the `draw_star` function are incorrect. The loops should range from 0 to n and from 0 to m, instead of ranging from 1 to n-1 and from 1 to m-1. 

2. The condition to check if a cell is part of a star is incorrect. Currently, the code checks if the current cell and its four adjacent cells are all asterisks. However, the condition should be that the current cell is an asterisk and the four diagonal cells are also asterisks. 

3. The condition for expanding the star is incorrect. Currently, the code checks if the diagonal cells of the current size are all asterisks. However, the condition should be that the cells at the corners of the star with the current size are all asterisks. 

4. The `draw_star` function returns `None` if no star is found, but the expected output for this case should be `-1`. 

5. The loop for reading the grid input does not handle the case where the input is given in multiple lines. Currently, the code assumes that the grid input is given in a single line. 

6. There is no need to use a separate variable `size` to keep track of the star size. The size can be easily inferred from the number of iterations in the while loop. 

7. The stars are not printed in the expected format. The row and column indices should be printed starting from 1, but the code currently prints them starting from 0. 

### BUGS
1. The loop indices in the `draw_star` function should range from 0 to n and from 0 to m, not from 1 to n-1 and from 1 to m-1. 

2. The condition to check if a cell is part of a star should be that the current cell is an asterisk and the four diagonal cells are also asterisks. 

3. The condition for expanding the star should be that the cells at the corners of the star with the current size are all asterisks. 

4. The `draw_star` function should return `-1` if no star is found, instead of returning `None`. 

5. The grid input should be read in multiple lines, not in a single line. 

6. The stars should be printed with row and column indices starting from 1, not from 0.
