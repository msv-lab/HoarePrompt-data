I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
One day, $n$ people ($n$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $n$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.

Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $1$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $[1, 3, 4, 2]$, $[4, 2, 1, 3]$ and $[2, 1, 3, 4]$ are indistinguishable.

For example, if $n=2$ then the number of ways is $1$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.

For example, if $n=4$ then the number of ways is $3$. Possible options:  one round dance — $[1,2]$, another — $[3,4]$;  one round dance — $[2,4]$, another — $[3,1]$;  one round dance — $[4,1]$, another — $[3,2]$. 

Your task is to find the number of ways $n$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ people.


-----Input-----

The input contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 20$), $n$ is an even number.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of ways to make two round dances. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in the $64$-bit integer data type.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
1

Input

3

Input

Output
1260

Input

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "8
" the output was "630
" but the expected output was "1260
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Observations
The given code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the factorial of `n-1` and then dividing it by `2` to the power of `n//2-1`. However, the code fails to produce the correct output for the given test case.

## Bugs
1. The code calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which is incorrect. The correct value to calculate factorial should be `n`.
2. The code does not handle the division correctly. It should divide by `2` raised to the power of `(n//2-1)`, but the code only divides by `2**(n//2-1)`.

## Impact
Due to the bugs in the code, it does not produce the correct output for the given test case. The factorial calculation is incorrect and the division operation is not performed correctly, leading to an incorrect final result.

### Original Code with Fixes

To fix the issues mentioned in the feedback, I have made the following changes to the original code:

1. Changed `factorial(n-1)` to `factorial(n)` in the function definition to calculate the factorial of `n`.
2. Changed `2**(n//2-1)` to `2**(n//2)` in the division operation to correctly divide the factorial result.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

result = factorial(n) // (2**(n//2))

print(result)
```

With these fixes, the code should now produce the correct output for the given test case.
