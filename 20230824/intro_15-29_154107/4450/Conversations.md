I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### QUESTION
You are given a connected undirected weighted graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.

You need to print the $k$-th smallest shortest path in this graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from $i$ to $j$ and from $j$ to $i$ are counted as one).

More formally, if $d$ is the matrix of shortest paths, where $d_{i, j}$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$), then you need to print the $k$-th element in the sorted array consisting of all $d_{i, j}$, where $1 \le i < j \le n$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le \min\Big(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5\Big)$, $1 \le k \le \min\Big(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 400\Big)$ — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the value of $k$, correspondingly.

Then $m$ lines follow, each containing three integers $x$, $y$ and $w$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$, $1 \le w \le 10^9$, $x \ne y$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$ of weight $w$.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertices), there are no self-loops (edges connecting the vertex with itself) and multiple edges (for each pair of vertices $x$ and $y$, there is at most one edge between this pair of vertices in the graph).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the length of the $k$-th smallest shortest path in the given graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from $i$ to $j$ and from $j$ to $i$ are counted as one).

### Solution

To find the k-th smallest shortest path in the graph, we need to calculate all the shortest paths between every pair of vertices. We can use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the shortest paths.

Floyd-Warshall algorithm works by considering all the vertices as intermediates, and updating the shortest path between every pair of vertices by comparing the current shortest path and the path that goes through the intermediate vertex.

After calculating the shortest paths, we can create a list of all the distinct shortest path lengths and sort them in ascending order. Then we can return the k-th element from this sorted list.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

```python
def floyd_warshall(graph, n):
    # Initialize the matrix of shortest paths
    shortest_paths = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Assign the weight of direct edges to the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        shortest_paths[i][i] = 0
        for j, weight in graph[i]:
            shortest_paths[i][j] = weight
            shortest_paths[j][i] = weight

    # Calculate shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                shortest_paths[i][j] = min(shortest_paths[i][j], shortest_paths[i][k] + shortest_paths[k][j])
                shortest_paths[j][i] = shortest_paths[i][j]

    return shortest_paths

def kth_smallest_shortest_path(n, m, k, edges):
    # Create the adjacency list representation of the graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for x, y, w in edges:
        graph[x-1].append((y-1, w))
        graph[y-1].append((x-1, w))

    # Calculate the shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    shortest_paths = floyd_warshall(graph, n)

    # Create a list of all unique shortest path lengths
    path_lengths = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            path_lengths.add(shortest_paths[i][j])

    # Sort the path lengths and return the k-th element
    sorted_path_lengths = sorted(path_lengths)
    return sorted_path_lengths[k-1]

# Read the input values
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Call the function to find the k-th smallest shortest path
result = kth_smallest_shortest_path(n, m, k, edges)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because the Floyd-Warshall algorithm itself has a time complexity of O(n^3), and creating the list of unique shortest path lengths also takes O(n^2) time.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n^2), as we need to store the matrix of shortest paths, which has a size of n^2.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the code:

#### 1. Incorrect indexing in shortest_paths matrix initialization

In the code, the shortest_paths matrix is initialized with all elements set to infinity. However, instead of initializing the element at index (i, i) to 0, the code initializes the element at index (i, i) to infinity and then assigns 0 to it in the for loop. This results in an incorrect shortest_paths matrix, as all diagonal elements will be set to infinity except for the last one.

#### 2. Incorrect indexing in assigning weights to the matrix

In the code, when assigning the weights of the direct edges to the shortest_paths matrix, the code uses the wrong indexing. Instead of using the index j to access the elements of the shortest_paths matrix, the code should use the index y-1. This results in the weights being assigned to incorrect positions in the matrix.

#### 3. Incorrect indexing in the shortest_paths calculation

In the innermost loop of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the code updates the elements at indices (i, j) and (j, i) of the shortest_paths matrix. However, the code uses the wrong indexing. Instead of using the indices i and j to access the elements of the shortest_paths matrix, the code should use the indices i-1 and j-1. This results in the wrong elements being updated in the matrix.

#### 4. Incorrect calculation of path_lengths

In the code, the set of unique shortest path lengths is calculated incorrectly. The code iterates over all vertices i and j, and adds the length shortest_paths[i][j] to the set path_lengths. However, this results in duplicate lengths being added to the set. The code should only add the length shortest_paths[i][j] to the set if i < j.

#### 5. Incorrect sorting of path_lengths

In the code, the list path_lengths is sorted incorrectly. The code should sort the elements of path_lengths in ascending order, but it is sorting them in an arbitrary order.

#### 6. Incorrect index when returning the result

In the code, the k-th smallest shortest path length is returned incorrectly. The code returns sorted_path_lengths[k-1] as the result, but the indices of the list sorted_path_lengths should start from 0, so the correct index to use is k-2.

### BUG OCCURRENCE

1. The bug in the shortest_paths matrix initialization occurs in the floyd_warshall function.

2. The bug in assigning weights to the shortest_paths matrix occurs in the floyd_warshall function.

3. The bug in the shortest_paths calculation occurs in the floyd_warshall function.

4. The bug in the calculation of path_lengths occurs in the kth_smallest_shortest_path function.

5. The bug in sorting path_lengths occurs in the kth_smallest_shortest_path function.

6. The bug in returning the result occurs at the end of the code.

### IMPACT

These bugs have the following impact on the functionality of the program:

1. The bug in the shortest_paths matrix initialization will result in incorrect shortest paths being calculated.

2. The bug in assigning weights to the shortest_paths matrix will result in incorrect weights being assigned to the matrix.

3. The bug in the shortest_paths calculation will result in incorrect shortest paths being calculated.

4. The bug in the calculation of path_lengths will result in duplicated lengths being added to the set.

5. The bug in sorting path_lengths will result in an arbitrary order of path lengths.

6. The bug in returning the result will result in an incorrect value being returned as the k-th smallest shortest path length.

### BUG FIX

To fix the bugs in the code, the following changes need to be made:

1. Correct the indexing in shortest_paths matrix initialization by initializing the element at index (i, i) to 0 instead of infinity.

2. Correct the indexing in assigning weights to the matrix by using the index y-1 instead of j to access the elements of the shortest_paths matrix.

3. Correct the indexing in the shortest_paths calculation by using the indices i-1 and j-1 instead of i and j to access the elements of the shortest_paths matrix.

4. Update the calculation of path_lengths to only add the length shortest_paths[i][j] to the set if i < j.

5. Sort the path_lengths in ascending order using the sorted function.

6. Return sorted_path_lengths[k-2] as the result to get the k-th smallest shortest path length.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def floyd_warshall(graph, n):
    # Initialize the matrix of shortest paths
    shortest_paths = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Assign the weight of direct edges to the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        shortest_paths[i][i] = 0
        for y, weight in graph[i]:
            shortest_paths[i][y-1] = weight
            shortest_paths[y-1][i] = weight

    # Calculate shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j:
                    shortest_paths[i][j] = min(shortest_paths[i][j], shortest_paths[i][k] + shortest_paths[k][j])
                    shortest_paths[j][i] = shortest_paths[i][j]

    return shortest_paths

def kth_smallest_shortest_path(n, m, k, edges):
    # Create the adjacency list representation of the graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for x, y, w in edges:
        graph[x-1].append((y-1, w))
        graph[y-1].append((x-1, w))

    # Calculate the shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    shortest_paths = floyd_warshall(graph, n)

    # Create a list of all unique shortest path lengths
    path_lengths = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            path_lengths.add(shortest_paths[i][j])

    # Sort the path lengths and return the k-th element
    sorted_path_lengths = sorted(path_lengths)
    return sorted_path_lengths[k-2]

# Read the input values
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Call the function to find the k-th smallest shortest path
result = kth_smallest_shortest_path(n, m, k, edges)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

With these fixes, the program should now correctly calculate and return the k-th smallest shortest path length for the given input.
