However, the problem statement specifies that the goal is to obtain an array of equal elements. So this condition should be inverted to `if a[i] == a[i+1]:`.\n\n#### Bug 2\nIn line 14, when performing the first type of operation (setting `a[i] := a[i] + |a[i] - a[i+1]|`), the index of the second element in the operation should be `i+1`, not `i+2`. So the code should be changed to `operations.append((1, i+1, i+1))`.\n\n#### Bug 3\nIn line 17, when performing the second type of operation (setting `a[i] := a[i] - |a[i] - a[i+1]|`), the index of the second element in the operation should be `i+1`, not `i+2`. So the code should be changed to `operations.append((2, i+1, i+1))`.\n\n#### Bug 4\nIn the last line, the code is printing the operations in the wrong order. The operations should be printed in reverse order, so the code should be changed to `for operation in operations[::-1]:`.\n\n#### Bug 5\nIn line 7, the variable `count` is not being updated correctly. Currently, it's counting the number of operations where the elements are different. However, this is not necessarily equal to the minimum number of operations required to obtain an array of equal elements. To fix this, we need to change the condition in line 9 to `if a[i] == a[i+1]:` and also add a check after the loop to see if `count` is odd. If it is, increment it by 1.\n\n#### Bug 6\nIn line 11, the code is incorrectly updating `a[i]` by adding or subtracting `|a[i] - a[i+1]|`. According to the problem statement, `a[i]` should be updated based on the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and the original value of `a[i]` before any operations were performed. So the code should be changed to `a[i] = a[i+1] + abs(a[i] - a[i+1])` for the first type of operation and `a[i] = a[i+1] - abs(a[i] - a[i+1])` for the second type of operation.\n\n#### Bug 7\nIn lines 11 and 15, the code is incorrectly updating `a[i]` using the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`. According to the problem statement, the absolute difference should be added/subtracted to/from `a[i]`, not used as the new value of `a[i]`. So the code should be changed to `a[i] += abs(a[i] - a[i+1])` for the first type of operation and `a[i] -= abs(a[i] - a[i+1])` for the second type of operation.\n\n### IMPACT\n\n- Bug 1: This bug causes the code to only perform operations when adjacent elements are the same, instead of when adjacent elements are different. This can lead to incorrect results if there are adjacent elements that are different.\n\n- Bug 2: This bug causes the code to add the incorrect index of the second element in the first type of operation. This will lead to incorrect operations being printed.\n\n- Bug 3: This bug causes the code to add the incorrect index of the second element in the second type of operation. This will lead to incorrect operations being printed.\n\n- Bug 4: This bug causes the code to print the operations in the wrong order. Instead of printing the operations in reverse order, the code is currently printing them in the order they were performed. This will lead to incorrect output.\n\n- Bug 5: This bug causes the code to incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations required. By counting the number of operations where the elements are different, the code is not considering cases where multiple operations can be combined into a single operation.\n\n- Bug 6: This bug causes the code to incorrectly update `a[i]` by adding/subtracting the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`. This will lead to incorrect values for `a[i]` after each operation.\n\n- Bug 7: This bug causes the code to incorrectly update `a[i]` using the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` as the new value of `a[i]`. This will lead to incorrect values for `a[i]` after each operation.",
