I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given an image A composed of N rows and N columns of pixels, and a template image B composed of M rows and M columns of pixels.

A pixel is the smallest element of an image, and in this problem it is a square of size 1×1.

Also, the given images are binary images, and the color of each pixel is either white or black.  
In the input, every pixel is represented by a character: . corresponds to a white pixel, and # corresponds to a black pixel.

The image A is given as N strings A_1,...,A_N.

The j-th character in the string A_i corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row and j-th column of the image A (1≦i,j≦N).

Similarly, the template image B is given as M strings B_1,...,B_M.

The j-th character in the string B_i corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row and j-th column of the template image B (1≦i,j≦M).  
Determine whether the template image B is contained in the image A when only parallel shifts can be applied to the images.  

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦M≦N≦50 
 - A_i is a string of length N consisting of # and ..
 - B_i is a string of length M consisting of # and ..

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1
A_2
:  
A_N
B_1
B_2
:  
B_M

-----Output-----
Print Yes if the template image B is contained in the image A. Print No otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
3 2
#.#
.#.
#.#
#.
.#

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

The template image B is identical to the upper-left 2 × 2 subimage and the lower-right 2 × 2 subimage of A. Thus, the output should be Yes.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
