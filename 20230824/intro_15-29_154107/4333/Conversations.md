I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There is a square in the xy-plane. The coordinates of its four vertices are (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3) and (x_4,y_4) in counter-clockwise order.
(Assume that the positive x-axis points right, and the positive y-axis points up.)
Takahashi remembers (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), but he has forgot (x_3,y_3) and (x_4,y_4).
Given x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2, restore x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4. It can be shown that x_3,y_3,x_4 and y_4 uniquely exist and have integer values.

-----Constraints-----
 - |x_1|,|y_1|,|x_2|,|y_2| \leq 100
 - (x_1,y_1) ≠ (x_2,y_2)
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2

-----Output-----
Print x_3,y_3,x_4 and y_4 as integers, in this order.

-----Sample Input-----
0 0 0 1

-----Sample Output-----
-1 1 -1 0

(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0) is the four vertices of a square in counter-clockwise order.
Note that (x_3,y_3)=(1,1),(x_4,y_4)=(1,0) is not accepted, as the vertices are in clockwise order.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())

#calculate the difference between x1 and x2, y1 and y2 to get the distance
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1

#restore x3 and y3 by adding dy to x2 and subtracting dx to y2
x3 = x2 + dy
y3 = y2 - dx

#restore x4 and y4 by adding dx to x3 and dy to y3
x4 = x3 + dx
y4 = y3 + dy

print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "0 0 0 1
" the output was "1 1 1 2
" but the expected output was "-1 1 -1 0
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs in the code provided.

1. The calculation of `dx` and `dy` is incorrect. The code subtracts `x1` from `x2` and `y1` from `y2`, which means it is calculating the difference in the opposite way. It should be `dx = x1 - x2` and `dy = y1 - y2`.

2. The restoration of `x3` and `y3` is incorrect. The code adds `dy` to `x2` and subtracts `dx` from `y2`. However, this is incorrect. To restore `x3` and `y3`, we need to subtract `dy` from `x2` and add `dx` to `y2`.

3. The restoration of `x4` and `y4` is incorrect. The code adds `dx` to `x3` and `dy` to `y3`. However, this is incorrect. To restore `x4` and `y4`, we need to subtract `dx` from `x3` and subtract `dy` from `y3`.

### BUGS

1. The calculation of `dx` and `dy` is incorrect.
   - The bug occurs in lines 3 and 4.
   - The impact of this bug is that the difference between the given points is not calculated correctly, leading to incorrect restoration of the other points.

2. The restoration of `x3` and `y3` is incorrect.
   - The bug occurs in lines 8 and 9.
   - The impact of this bug is that the coordinates of the third point are not restored correctly, leading to incorrect output.

3. The restoration of `x4` and `y4` is incorrect.
   - The bug occurs in lines 12 and 13.
   - The impact of this bug is that the coordinates of the fourth point are not restored correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION

To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Correct the calculation of `dx` and `dy` by swapping the order of subtraction. Instead of `dx = x2 - x1` and `dy = y2 - y1`, we should have `dx = x1 - x2` and `dy = y1 - y2`.

2. Correct the restoration of `x3` and `y3` by subtracting `dy` from `x2` and adding `dx` to `y2`. Instead of `x3 = x2 + dy` and `y3 = y2 - dx`, we should have `x3 = x2 - dy` and `y3 = y2 + dx`.

3. Correct the restoration of `x4` and `y4` by subtracting `dx` from `x3` and subtracting `dy` from `y3`. Instead of `x4 = x3 + dx` and `y4 = y3 + dy`, we should have `x4 = x3 - dx` and `y4 = y3 - dy`.

### CORRECTED CODE

Here is the corrected code:

```python
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the difference between x1 and x2, y1 and y2 to get the distance
dx = x1 - x2
dy = y1 - y2

# Restore x3 and y3 by subtracting dy from x2 and adding dx to y2
x3 = x2 - dy
y3 = y2 + dx

# Restore x4 and y4 by subtracting dx from x3 and subtracting dy from y3
x4 = x3 - dx
y4 = y3 - dy

print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
```

This fixed code should correctly calculate and restore the coordinates of the missing points based on the given inputs.
