The second line of code reads the coordinates of the houses of the friends and stores them in a list named `x`.\n\n3. The next line of code creates a set `x_set` from the list of coordinates `x`. This set will contain only unique values, removing any duplicates.\n\n4. The next line of code calculates the minimum number of occupied houses by finding the length of the `x_set` set.\n\n5. Finally, the next line of code calculates the maximum number of occupied houses by finding the minimum value in the `x` list minus 1 and the difference between `n` and the maximum value in the `x` list. The maximum number of occupied houses is the maximum of these two values.\n\n6. The last line of code prints the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses.\n\n### BUGS/ISSUES\n1. The main issue with the code is in the calculation of the maximum number of occupied houses. The calculation is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.\n\n2. Additionally, the calculation of the minimum number of occupied houses could be simplified.\n\n### BUG 1 - Incorrect calculation of maximum number of occupied houses:\nThe line `max_houses = max(min(x) - 1, n - max(x))` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of occupied houses. \n\nThe correct calculation for the maximum number of occupied houses should be as follows:\n- The maximum number of occupied houses occurs if all friends choose to move to either the leftmost house (`x = 1`), or to the rightmost house (`x = n`). In this case, the number of occupied houses would be the difference between the maximum value in the `x` list and the minimum value in the `x` list, plus 1.\n\n### BUG 2 - Unnecessary code:\nThe line `x_set = set(x)` creates a set `x_set` from the list of coordinates `x`. This set is not used anywhere else in the code and therefore is unnecessary.\n\n### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS\n1. Fix the calculation of the maximum number of occupied houses as explained above.\n\n2. Remove the unnecessary line of code that creates the `x_set` set.\n\n### SUGGESTED CODE\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```\nn = int(input())\nx = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmin_houses = len(set(x))\n\nmax_houses = max(max(x) - min(x) + 1, n)\nprint(min_houses, max_houses)\n```\n\nWith these changes, the code should produce the correct output for the provided examples.",
