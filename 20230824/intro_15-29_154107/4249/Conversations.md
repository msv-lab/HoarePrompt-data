I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Polycarp has to write a coursework. The coursework consists of $m$ pages.

Polycarp also has $n$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $i$-th cup Polycarp has $a_i$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).

Surely, courseworks are not being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least).

Let's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $k$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_k}$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $a_{i_1}$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$ pages, ..., the $k$-th cup gives him energy to write $max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$ pages.

If Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.

Polycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m \le 10^9$) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the $i$-th cup.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 8
2 3 1 1 2

Output
4

Input

1 3 4 2 1 4 2

Output

Output
1

Input
5 16
5 5 5 5 5

Output
2

Input
5 26
5 5 5 5 5

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write $1$ page), first and second cups during second day (and write $2 + (3 - 1) = 4$ pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write $2$ pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write $1$ page) so the answer is $4$. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days.

In the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $4$ pages) so the answer is $2$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.

In the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$ pages of coursework.

In the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write $5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14$ pages of coursework and during second day he will write $5$ pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.

In the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.
### Requirements

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5 8
2 3 1 1 2
" the output was "-1
" but the expected output was "4
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
Let's go through the code and identify the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.

#### Bug 1: Incorrect Calculation of Pages Written
In the code, the variable `pages` is calculated as `pages = max(0, caffeine - days)`. However, this is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the number of pages written for each cup of coffee should be `max(0, caffeine - (days - 1))` instead. 

Impact: This bug causes the program to write fewer pages than expected for each cup of coffee. As a result, the total number of pages written will be less than the actual number of pages that can be written with the given cups of coffee. This can lead to an incorrect minimum number of days required to complete the coursework.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect Update of Minimum Caffeine Dosage Needed
In the code, the line `min_caffeine = min(min_caffeine, pages + days)` is used to update the minimum caffeine dosage needed. However, this is also incorrect. According to the problem statement, the minimum caffeine dosage needed should be `min(min_caffeine, caffeine - (days - 1))` instead.

Impact: This bug causes the program to update the minimum caffeine dosage needed incorrectly. As a result, the value of `min_caffeine` will be lower than it should be. This can lead to an incorrect minimum number of days required to complete the coursework.

#### Bug 3: Incorrect Check for Completion of Coursework
In the code, the line `if pages_written >= m:` is used to check if all pages have been written. However, this is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the number of pages written should be compared to `m` plus the number of days so far (`m + days`). 

Impact: This bug causes the program to prematurely terminate the loop when the number of pages written is equal to `m`, instead of `m + days`. This can lead to an incorrect minimum number of days required to complete the coursework.

#### Bug 4: Incorrect Check for Possibility to Write Coursework
In the code, the line `if pages_written < m:` is used to check if it is possible to write the coursework. However, this is incorrect. According to the problem statement, it should be checked if it is possible to write the coursework by comparing the total number of pages that can be written with the given cups of coffee (`pages_written + (n - days) + m + 1`) to `m`.

Impact: This bug causes the program to incorrectly determine if it is possible to write the coursework. As a result, the program may mistakenly print -1 even if it is possible to write the coursework.
