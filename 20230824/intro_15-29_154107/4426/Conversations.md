I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

It is Saturday today, and tomorrow will be Sunday.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
days = ['SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']
S = input()
next_Sunday = (days.index('SUN') - days.index(S)) % 7
print(next_Sunday)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "SUN
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "7
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "SUN
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "7
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            #### Review

The code you provided seems to have a logical error. Let's analyze the code and identify the bugs:

1. The variable `days` is a list that represents the days of the week. However, the order of the days in the list is incorrect. The correct order should be `['MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT', 'SUN']` with Monday as the first element and Sunday as the last element.

2. The line `S = input()` is used to get the input from the user. However, the code is expecting the input to be in the form of three capital letters representing the day of the week. To ensure the code function properly, the input should be validated to ensure it is one of the valid options.

3. The calculation of `next_Sunday` is incorrect. The code uses the formula `(days.index('SUN') - days.index(S)) % 7` to calculate the number of days until the next Sunday. However, this formula will not work in all cases. For example, if `S` is 'SUN', the calculation will return 0, even though it should be 7.

4. The calculation of `next_Sunday` does not take into account the possibility that `S` is already a Sunday. In this case, the code should return 7, as Sunday is already the next day.

5. The code does not handle the case where `S` is not a valid day of the week. This could cause an exception to be raised if an invalid day is provided as input.

These are the bugs that I identified in the code. Fixing these bugs should help the code to produce the correct output.

### BUG FREE PYTHON CODE:

```python
days = ['MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT', 'SUN']
S = input()

if S not in days:
    print("Invalid day")
    exit()

next_Sunday = (days.index('SUN') - days.index(S)) % 7

if next_Sunday == 0:
    next_Sunday = 7

print(next_Sunday)
```

I have fixed the bugs in the code based on the provided feedback. Here are the changes that I made:

1. I changed the order of the days in the `days` list to reflect the correct order starting with Monday and ending with Sunday.

2. I added an input validation check to ensure that the input is one of the valid days of the week. If the input is not valid, the code prints "Invalid day" and exits.

3. I modified the calculation of `next_Sunday` to handle the case where `S` is already a Sunday. If `next_Sunday` is 0, I set it to 7 to indicate that Sunday is already the next day.

4. I added a check for the case where `S` is not a valid day of the week. If this is the case, an error message is printed and the code exits.

With these changes, the code should now produce the correct output for the given input.
