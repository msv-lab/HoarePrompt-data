          "feedback": "#### Review\n\nThe code you provided seems to have a logical error. Let's analyze the code and identify the bugs:\n\n1. The variable `days` is a list that represents the days of the week. However, the order of the days in the list is incorrect. The correct order should be `['MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT', 'SUN']` with Monday as the first element and Sunday as the last element.\n\n2. The line `S = input()` is used to get the input from the user. However, the code is expecting the input to be in the form of three capital letters representing the day of the week. To ensure the code function properly, the input should be validated to ensure it is one of the valid options.\n\n3. The calculation of `next_Sunday` is incorrect. The code uses the formula `(days.index('SUN') - days.index(S)) % 7` to calculate the number of days until the next Sunday. However, this formula will not work in all cases. For example, if `S` is 'SUN', the calculation will return 0, even though it should be 7.\n\n4. The calculation of `next_Sunday` does not take into account the possibility that `S` is already a Sunday. In this case, the code should return 7, as Sunday is already the next day.\n\n5. The code does not handle the case where `S` is not a valid day of the week. This could cause an exception to be raised if an invalid day is provided as input.\n\nThese are the bugs that I identified in the code. Fixing these bugs should help the code to produce the correct output.",
