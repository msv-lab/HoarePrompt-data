I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.
When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient. The value of the new ingredient will be (x + y) / 2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.
After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 50
 - 1 \leq v_i \leq 1000
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
v_1 v_2 \ldots v_N

-----Output-----
Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.
Your output will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

-----Sample Input-----
2
3 4

-----Sample Output-----
3.5

If you start with two ingredients, the only choice is to put both of them in the pot. The value of the ingredient resulting from the ingredients of values 3 and 4 is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
Printing 3.50001, 3.49999, and so on will also be accepted.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Review:

The code you have written is nearly correct, but there are a few bugs that need to be fixed in order to produce the correct output. Let's go through each bug and discuss their impact on the program's functionality:

### Bug 1: Missing import statement

In the provided code, the `bisect` module is used without being imported. You need to add the following import statement at the beginning of your code:
```python
import bisect
```
#### Impact:
Because the `bisect` module is not imported, the code raises a `NameError` when trying to use the `bisect.bisect_left()` function. As a result, the code terminates abruptly and does not produce any output.

### Bug 2: Invalid calculation of new value

In the merging process, the calculation of the new value is incorrect:
```python
new_value = (values[0] + values[1]) / 2
```
#### Impact:
By computing the average of the two smallest ingredients, you are essentially finding the arithmetic mean, not the required operation of taking the average of the values. This bug affects the accuracy of the final result, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug 3: Incorrect removal of merged ingredients

When merging two ingredients, you are removing the wrong elements from the `values` list:
```python
values = values[2:]
```
#### Impact:
By slicing the list `values` from index 2 onwards, you are removing the first two elements. This is incorrect because you need to remove the two smallest values, not the first two values from the sorted list. As a consequence, the incorrect elements are being removed, leading to incorrect merging and a wrong final result.

### Bug 4: Incorrect insertion of new value

After computing the new value, you are inserting it at the wrong position in the sorted `values` list:
```python
insertion_index = bisect.bisect_left(values, new_value)
values.insert(insertion_index, new_value)
```
#### Impact:
The `bisect.bisect_left()` function returns the index where the new value should be inserted in order to keep the list sorted. However, you are using it incorrectly by assuming the list is already sorted. This incorrect indexing leads to wrong placement of the new value, resulting in an erroneous final result.

### Bug 5: Incorrect output

At the end of the code, you are not printing the correct maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining:
```python
print(values[0])
```
#### Impact:
Since the bugs mentioned above prevent the correct calculation of the last ingredient's value, the output of printing `values[0]` will be incorrect. As a result, the code produces an incorrect final value as output.

## Suggestions:

1. Import the `bisect` module at the beginning of your code:
```python
import bisect
```

2. Correctly calculate the new value by taking the correct average of the two smallest values:
```python
new_value = (values[0] + values[1]) / 2
```

3. Remove the two smallest values from the list by slicing it correctly:
```python
values = values[2:]
```

4. Find the correct insertion index using the `bisect.bisect_left()` function to insert the new value:
```python
insertion_index = bisect.bisect_left(values, new_value)
values.insert(insertion_index, new_value)
```

5. Print the correct maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining:
```python
print(values[-1])
```
By making these corrections, you should be able to obtain the correct output for the given task.

Please fix these bugs and run your code again to check if the output is correct. Let me know if you have any further questions.

Apologies for the confusion, here's the correct implementation of the code:

```python
import bisect

N = int(input())
values = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the values in ascending order
values.sort()

# Keep merging the ingredients until only one is left
while len(values) > 1:
    # Take the two smallest values and calculate the new value
    new_value = (values[0] + values[1]) / 2
    # Remove the two smallest values
    values = values[2:]
    # Insert the new value at the correct index
    insertion_index = bisect.bisect_left(values, new_value)
    values.insert(insertion_index, new_value)

# Print the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining
print(values[-1])
```

The code should now produce the correct output. Let me know if you have any further questions.
