          "feedback": "## Feedback\n\nThe code has a few bugs that are affecting the program's functionality. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. Incorrect calculation of `max_diff`\nIn the code, the maximum beauty difference (`max_diff`) is calculated using `max(beauties) - min(beauties)`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum beauty difference is achieved. In some cases, there may be a pair of flowers with a larger beauty difference than the difference between the maximum and minimum beauty numbers.\n\n### 2. Incorrect calculation of `count_max_diff`\nThe calculation of `count_max_diff` is incorrect. The current code calculates `count_max_diff` as the product of the count of the maximum beauty number and the count of the minimum beauty number. This logic does not account for the possibility that there may be other pairs of flowers with the same beauty difference.\n\n### 3. Inaccurate handling of cases where `max_diff == 0`\nThe code checks if `max_diff` is equal to 0, and if so, directly calculates `count_max_diff` as `n * (n - 1) / 2`. However, this calculation assumes that all pairs of flowers have the same beauty number, which may not be the case.\n\n### 4. Incomplete handling of the input format\nThe code assumes that the input format for the number of flowers and the beauty numbers is fixed. However, it does not handle cases where the input format does not match the expected format (e.g., extra spaces, newline characters, etc.).\n\n### 5. Potential performance issue with `beauties.count()`\nThe code uses the `count()` method twice to calculate `count_max_diff`. This method has a time complexity of O(n), which means that the overall time complexity of calculating `count_max_diff` is O(n^2). This can be inefficient for large input sizes.\n\nThese are the bugs I identified in the code. Fixing these issues should result in the correct output for the given input examples.",
