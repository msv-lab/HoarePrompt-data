          "feedback": "### REVIEW\n\nThe code provided seems to have some bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:\n\n#### Bug 1: Incorrect Condition to Check Black Cell in Each Row\nAt line 10, the code is checking if there is a black cell in each row by using the condition `'B' not in grid[i]`. However, this condition checks if there are no black cells in the entire row, which is incorrect. We should actually check if there is at least one black cell in the row. To fix this bug, change line 10 to:\n```python\nif 'B' not in grid[i]:\n```\n\n#### Bug 2: Incorrect Condition to Check Black Cell in Each Column\nAt lines 15-18, the code is checking if there is a black cell in each column. However, the logic used is incorrect. The current code checks if there is at least one black cell in each column, but it should actually check if there is at least one black cell in each column for every row. To fix this bug, change lines 15-18 to:\n```python\nfor i in range(n):\n    if 'B' not in grid[i][j]:\n```\n\n#### Bug 3: Incorrect Condition to Check Cells Requiring More Than One Direction Change\nAt lines 23-29, the code is checking if there are any cells that require more than one direction change to reach them. However, the logic used is incorrect. The current code checks if a cell at position `(i, j)` is a black cell, and if its adjacent cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j+1)` are not black cells. This condition is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of a black cell being in a corner position. To fix this bug, change lines 23-29 to:\n```python\nif grid[i][j] == 'B':\n    if not ((i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 'B') or\n            (i < n-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 'B') or\n            (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 'B') or\n            (j < m-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 'B')):\n```\n\nWith these bug fixes, the code should now produce correct output for the given input.",
