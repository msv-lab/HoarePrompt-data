I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are going to the beach with the idea to build the greatest sand castle ever in your head! The beach is not as three-dimensional as you could have imagined, it can be decribed as a line of spots to pile up sand pillars. Spots are numbered 1 through infinity from left to right. 

Obviously, there is not enough sand on the beach, so you brought n packs of sand with you. Let height h_{i} of the sand pillar on some spot i be the number of sand packs you spent on it. You can't split a sand pack to multiple pillars, all the sand from it should go to a single one. There is a fence of height equal to the height of pillar with H sand packs to the left of the first spot and you should prevent sand from going over it. 

Finally you ended up with the following conditions to building the castle:  h_1 ≤ H: no sand from the leftmost spot should go over the fence;  For any $i \in [ 1 ; \infty)$ |h_{i} - h_{i} + 1| ≤ 1: large difference in heights of two neighboring pillars can lead sand to fall down from the higher one to the lower, you really don't want this to happen;  $\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} h_{i} = n$: you want to spend all the sand you brought with you. 

As you have infinite spots to build, it is always possible to come up with some valid castle structure. Though you want the castle to be as compact as possible. 

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of spots you can occupy so that all the aforementioned conditions hold.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integer numbers n and H (1 ≤ n, H ≤ 10^18) — the number of sand packs you have and the height of the fence, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of spots you can occupy so the all the castle building conditions hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2

Output
3

Input
6 8

Output
3



-----Note-----

Here are the heights of some valid castles:   n = 5, H = 2, [2, 2, 1, 0, ...], [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, ...]  n = 6, H = 8, [3, 2, 1, 0, ...], [2, 2, 1, 1, 0, ...], [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0...] (this one has 5 spots occupied) 

The first list for both cases is the optimal answer, 3 spots are occupied in them.

And here are some invalid ones:  n = 5, H = 2, [3, 2, 0, ...], [2, 3, 0, ...], [1, 0, 2, 2, ...]  n = 6, H = 8, [2, 2, 2, 0, ...], [6, 0, ...], [1, 4, 1, 0...], [2, 2, 1, 0, ...]
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
import math

def minimum_spots(n, H):
    if n <= H:
        return math.ceil(n/2)
    else:
        return H + math.ceil((n - H) / 2)

print(minimum_spots(n, H))
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5 2
" the output was "4
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Observations:

The requirements for building the castle are as follows:
- The height of the first sand pillar should be less than or equal to the fence height (h_1 ≤ H).
- The difference in height between any two neighboring pillars should be at most 1 (|h_{i} - h_{i+1}| ≤ 1).
- The sum of the heights of all pillars should be equal to the number of sand packs (n).

The goal is to minimize the number of spots occupied while still meeting these requirements.

### Bugs:

1. The current implementation does not handle the case when n ≤ H correctly. In this case, all the sand packs can be used to build the first spot, so the output should be 1. However, the code returns ceil(n/2), which is incorrect.

2. In the else part of the code, the calculation for the number of spots occupied is incorrect. The code adds H to the result, which represents the number of spots occupied by the fence. However, the fence should be counted in the total number of spots occupied, so this addition is incorrect.

### Bugs in Detail:
1. **Handling n ≤ H:** 
   - When n ≤ H, it means that all the sand packs can be used to build the first spot. In this case, the output should be 1, as only one spot is occupied.
   - However, the code currently uses the formula ceil(n/2) to calculate the result. This formula is incorrect for the case when n ≤ H. For example, when n = 5 and H = 5, the code will return ceil(5/2) = 3, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach in this case is to use n itself as the result, as all the sand packs can be used to build the first spot.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Occupied Spots:**
   - In the else part of the code, the calculation for the number of spots occupied is incorrect.
   - The code adds H to the result, which represents the number of spots occupied by the fence. However, the fence should be counted in the total number of spots occupied, so adding H to the result is incorrect.
   - For example, when n = 6 and H = 8, the code will return H + ceil((n - H) / 2) = 8 + ceil((6 - 8) / 2) = 8 + ceil(-1 / 2) = 8 - 1 = 7, which is incorrect. The correct answer in this case is 3 occupied spots.
   
### Impact:

These bugs in the code result in incorrect outputs for the given examples. The code fails to handle the case when n ≤ H correctly, and the calculation for the number of spots occupied is also incorrect. As a result, the code returns incorrect results for different input combinations.

These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program, as the output is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem.
