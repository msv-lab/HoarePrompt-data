I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

 


-----Input-----

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.


-----Output-----

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1 2

Input
4

Output
1 3

Input
12

Output
5 7
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "12
" the output was "1 11
" but the expected output was "5 7
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
The code provided takes an integer input `n` and tries to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`. However, the code has some bugs that result in incorrect output for certain inputs.

Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. The `gcd` function:
   The `gcd` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, `a` and `b`. This function seems correct and does not contain any bugs.
   
2. The `find_fraction` function:
   - The function starts from `b = n - 1` and iterates downwards until `b` is equal to 1. This approach suggests that we are iterating through all possible denominators in descending order.
   - For each `b`, the function calculates `a = n - b`. This is the numerator of the fraction.
   - The function checks if `gcd(a, b) == 1` to determine if the fraction is irreducible.
   - If the condition is true, it returns the values of `a` and `b`.
   - If the function does not find any irreducible fraction, it returns `-1, -1`.
   
3. The main part:
   - The code reads the input integer `n`.
   - It calls the `find_fraction` function with `n` as the argument to get the numerator `a` and denominator `b` of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.
   - Finally, it prints the values of `a` and `b`.
   
Now, let's analyze the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality:

1. Incorrect iteration in `find_fraction`:
   The `find_fraction` function starts iterating from `n - 1` for `b`. However, it should iterate from `n // 2` to `n - 1`. This is because the fraction should be proper, meaning the numerator should be smaller than the denominator. In other words, `a < b`. By starting from `n - 1`, we are missing some possible fractions that satisfy the condition.
   
2. Incorrect numerator calculation:
   The `find_fraction` function calculates the numerator `a` as `n - b`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct numerator should be `(n - b) // 2`. This is because we need to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction, which means the numerator (`a`) should be the largest possible value while still being smaller than the denominator (`b`).

These bugs have a significant impact on the program's functionality. The incorrect iteration range and incorrect numerator calculation can result in missing the correct fraction or producing incorrect fractions. This is evident in the provided example where the input `12` gives an output of `1 11`, instead of the expected output `5 7`.

### BUG FIX
Here's the corrected code with the bugs fixed:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

def find_fraction(n):
    for b in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        a = (n - b) // 2
        if gcd(a, b) == 1:
            return a, b
    return -1, -1

n = int(input())
a, b = find_fraction(n)
print(a, b)
```

The bugs described in the review have been fixed with the following changes:

1. Corrected iteration range in `find_fraction`:
   - Changed the range of `b` to iterate from `n // 2` to 1. This ensures that we consider all possible denominators in descending order.
   
2. Corrected numerator calculation in `find_fraction`:
   - Changed the calculation of `a` to `(n - b) // 2`. This ensures that the numerator is the largest possible value while still being smaller than the denominator.
   
These fixes will accurately find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`.
