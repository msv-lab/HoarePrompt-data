I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Stepan has n pens. Every day he uses them, and on the i-th day he uses the pen number i. On the (n + 1)-th day again he uses the pen number 1, on the (n + 2)-th — he uses the pen number 2 and so on.

On every working day (from Monday to Saturday, inclusive) Stepan spends exactly 1 milliliter of ink of the pen he uses that day. On Sunday Stepan has a day of rest, he does not stend the ink of the pen he uses that day. 

Stepan knows the current volume of ink in each of his pens. Now it's the Monday morning and Stepan is going to use the pen number 1 today. Your task is to determine which pen will run out of ink before all the rest (that is, there will be no ink left in it), if Stepan will use the pens according to the conditions described above.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 000) — the number of pens Stepan has.

The second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where a_{i} is equal to the number of milliliters of ink which the pen number i currently has.


-----Output-----

Print the index of the pen which will run out of ink before all (it means that there will be no ink left in it), if Stepan will use pens according to the conditions described above. 

Pens are numbered in the order they are given in input data. The numeration begins from one. 

Note that the answer is always unambiguous, since several pens can not end at the same time.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
3 3 3

Output
2

Input
5
5 4 5 4 4

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first test Stepan uses ink of pens as follows:   on the day number 1 (Monday) Stepan will use the pen number 1, after that there will be 2 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 2 (Tuesday) Stepan will use the pen number 2, after that there will be 2 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 3 (Wednesday) Stepan will use the pen number 3, after that there will be 2 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 4 (Thursday) Stepan will use the pen number 1, after that there will be 1 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 5 (Friday) Stepan will use the pen number 2, after that there will be 1 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 6 (Saturday) Stepan will use the pen number 3, after that there will be 1 milliliters of ink in it;  on the day number 7 (Sunday) Stepan will use the pen number 1, but it is a day of rest so he will not waste ink of this pen in it;  on the day number 8 (Monday) Stepan will use the pen number 2, after that this pen will run out of ink. 

So, the first pen which will not have ink is the pen number 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
3 3 3
" the output was "1
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are two bugs in the given code:

1. Index out of range error: 
    - On line 13, the current pen is calculated incorrectly. The modulo operation (`day % n`) returns a value in the range [0, n-1]. However, the pens are numbered from 1 to n. So, we should add 1 to the result of the modulo operation to get the correct index of the current pen.
    - This bug leads to accessing the element at index -1 in the `remaining_ink` list, which results in an index error. 
    - This bug impacts the correctness of the program, causing it to terminate prematurely and potentially giving incorrect results.

2. Incorrect check for empty pens:
   - On line 17, the code checks if all the pens have the same remaining ink (`len(set(remaining_ink)) > 1`), which implies that there is at least one pen that still has some ink left.
   - However, the requirement is to find the pen that will run out of ink before all the rest, which means that there should be no ink left in it.
   - This bug impacts the correctness of the program because it does not correctly identify the pen that will run out of ink first.

These bugs need to be fixed in order for the code to produce the correct output.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
I have fixed the identified bugs in the code. The following is the corrected Python code:

```python
n = int(input())
ink_volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))

remaining_ink = ink_volumes.copy()
day = 0
while len(set(remaining_ink)) == n:
    day += 1
    current_pen = (day % n) + 1
    remaining_ink[current_pen-1] -= 1
    if day % 7 != 0:
        remaining_ink[current_pen-1] -= 1

empty_pen = remaining_ink.index(min(remaining_ink))
print(empty_pen + 1)
```

I have made the following changes to fix the bugs:

1. Fixed index out of range error:
   - On line 11, I added 1 to the result of the modulo operation (`day % n`) to get the correct index of the current pen.
   
2. Revised check for empty pens:
   - On line 17, I changed the condition from `len(set(remaining_ink)) > 1` to `len(set(remaining_ink)) == n` to correctly identify the pen that will run out of ink first. Now, the condition checks if all the pens still have ink, which means that there are no empty pens yet.

With these corrections, the code should now produce the correct output for the given test case and other similar cases.
