          "feedback": "### BUG 1: Indexing Error\nIn the line `s = s[:i] + c_2 + s[i+1:]`, the code is incorrectly updating the string `s` within the loop. However, in each iteration, the index `i` is changing, but the length of the string `s` is not being updated. This leads to an index out of range error and incorrect results.\n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect Replacement\nEven if the indexing error is fixed, the code still does not correctly replace the characters `c_1` with `c_2`. Currently, it only replaces the first occurrence of `c_1` within the given range `l` to `r`. However, the requirement states that all occurrences of `c_1` within the range should be replaced.\n\n### BUG 3: Not Updating Range\nAfter each operation, the range `l` to `r` should be updated to reflect the changes made to the string `s`. This is necessary because the indices of the characters in `s` change after replacements are made. Currently, the code does not update the range, resulting in incorrect replacements in subsequent iterations.\n\n### IMPACT\nThese bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:\n\n1. Indexing Error: The program will throw an \"index out of range\" error and terminate prematurely. This happens because the code tries to access indices that are outside the range of the string.\n2. Incorrect Replacement: Even if the indexing error is fixed, the program will only replace the first occurrence of `c_1` within the given range. This leads to incorrect results as all occurrences of `c_1` should be replaced.\n3. Not Updating Range: After each operation, the program does not update the range `l` to `r` to reflect the changes made to the string `s`. This results in incorrect replacements in subsequent operations, as the indices of the characters in `s` have changed.\n\n### SUGGESTED FIX\nTo fix these bugs, the following changes can be made to the code:\n\n1. Initialize a new string `new_s` with the same content as `s`, and use `new_s` for making replacements instead of modifying `s` directly.\n2. Update the range `l` to `r` after each operation to reflect the changes made to `new_s`.\n3. Replace all occurrences of `c_1` within the updated range `(l, r)` in `new_s`, instead of just the first occurrence.\n4. Finally, assign the updated `new_s` back to `s` before moving on to the next iteration.\n\nThe fixed code is provided below:\n\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ns = input()\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, c_1, c_2 = input().split()\n    l = int(l) - 1\n    r = int(r) - 1\n\n    new_s = s\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n        if new_s[i] == c_1:\n            new_s = new_s[:i] + c_2 + new_s[i+1:]\n\n    s = new_s\n\nprint(s)\n```\n\nBy making these changes, the program should produce the correct output.",
