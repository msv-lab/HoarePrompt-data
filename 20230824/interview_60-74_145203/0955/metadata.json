The line `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:` is checking the length of the set, but the set is created by concatenating the vitamin strings. This will result in a set of characters, not a set of vitamins. As a result, the code is incorrectly counting instances where a juice contains the same vitamin multiple times.\n\nBug 2:\nThe code is not correctly finding the minimum total price. The variable `min_price` is initialized as `float('inf')`, but it is not updated correctly. The line `min_price = min(min_price, total_price)` should be inside the if condition `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:`. In the current implementation, the code is updating `min_price` even when all three vitamins are not present in a juice.\n\nThese bugs result in incorrect output: the code is not finding the minimum total price correctly and is sometimes considering juices that do not contain all three vitamins.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\nBug 1:\nTo fix the first bug, we need to change the line `all_vitamins = set(juices[i][1] + juices[j][1] + juices[k][1])` to create a set of the characters in the vitamin strings, rather than concatenating the strings. We can achieve this by using the `set()` function on each vitamin string separately in the set creation.\n\nBug 2:\nTo fix the second bug, we need to move the line `min_price = min(min_price, total_price)` inside the if condition `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:`. This update should only be made when all three vitamins are present in a juice.\n\n### CORRECTED CODE\n\nn = int(input())\njuices = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    price, vitamins = input().split()\n    juices.append((int(price), vitamins))\n\nmin_price = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        for k in range(j+1, n):\n            all_vitamins = set(juices[i][1]) | set(juices[j][1]) | set(juices[k][1])\n            if len(all_vitamins) == 3:\n                total_price = juices[i][0] + juices[j][0] + juices[k][0]\n                min_price = min(min_price, total_price)\n\nif min_price == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(min_price)",
