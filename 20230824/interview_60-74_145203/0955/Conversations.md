I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Berland shop sells $n$ kinds of juices. Each juice has its price $c_i$. Each juice includes some set of vitamins in it. There are three types of vitamins: vitamin "A", vitamin "B" and vitamin "C". Each juice can contain one, two or all three types of vitamins in it.

Petya knows that he needs all three types of vitamins to stay healthy. What is the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins? Petya obtains some vitamin if he buys at least one juice containing it and drinks it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 1\,000)$ — the number of juices.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains an integer $c_i$ $(1 \le c_i \le 100\,000)$ and a string $s_i$ — the price of the $i$-th juice and the vitamins it contains. String $s_i$ contains from $1$ to $3$ characters, and the only possible characters are "A", "B" and "C". It is guaranteed that each letter appears no more than once in each string $s_i$. The order of letters in strings $s_i$ is arbitrary.


-----Output-----

Print -1 if there is no way to obtain all three vitamins. Otherwise print the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
5 C
6 B
16 BAC
4 A

Output
15

Input

10 AB

Output

150 BC
160 AC
180 B
190 CA

Output
250

Input
2
5 BA
11 CB

Output
16



-----Note-----

In the first example Petya buys the first, the second and the fourth juice. He spends $5 + 6 + 4 = 15$ and obtains all three vitamins. He can also buy just the third juice and obtain three vitamins, but its cost is $16$, which isn't optimal.

In the second example Petya can't obtain all three vitamins, as no juice contains vitamin "C".
### Requirements

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are two bugs in the given code:

Bug 1:
The code is not correctly checking if a juice contains all three vitamins. The line `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:` is checking the length of the set, but the set is created by concatenating the vitamin strings. This will result in a set of characters, not a set of vitamins. As a result, the code is incorrectly counting instances where a juice contains the same vitamin multiple times.

Bug 2:
The code is not correctly finding the minimum total price. The variable `min_price` is initialized as `float('inf')`, but it is not updated correctly. The line `min_price = min(min_price, total_price)` should be inside the if condition `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:`. In the current implementation, the code is updating `min_price` even when all three vitamins are not present in a juice.

These bugs result in incorrect output: the code is not finding the minimum total price correctly and is sometimes considering juices that do not contain all three vitamins.

### BUG FIXES

Bug 1:
To fix the first bug, we need to change the line `all_vitamins = set(juices[i][1] + juices[j][1] + juices[k][1])` to create a set of the characters in the vitamin strings, rather than concatenating the strings. We can achieve this by using the `set()` function on each vitamin string separately in the set creation.

Bug 2:
To fix the second bug, we need to move the line `min_price = min(min_price, total_price)` inside the if condition `if len(all_vitamins) == 3:`. This update should only be made when all three vitamins are present in a juice.

### CORRECTED CODE

n = int(input())
juices = []
for _ in range(n):
    price, vitamins = input().split()
    juices.append((int(price), vitamins))

min_price = float('inf')
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        for k in range(j+1, n):
            all_vitamins = set(juices[i][1]) | set(juices[j][1]) | set(juices[k][1])
            if len(all_vitamins) == 3:
                total_price = juices[i][0] + juices[j][0] + juices[k][0]
                min_price = min(min_price, total_price)

if min_price == float('inf'):
    print(-1)
else:
    print(min_price)

The corrected code is provided below:

```

juices = []
for _ in range(n):
    price, vitamins = input().split()
    juices.append((int(price), vitamins))

min_price = float('inf')

            if len(all_vitamins) == 3:
                total_price = juices[i][0] + juices[j][0] + juices[k][0]
                min_price = min(min_price, total_price)

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())
juices = []
for _ in range(n):
    price, vitamins = input().split()
    juices.append((int(price), vitamins))

min_price = float('inf')
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        for k in range(j+1, n):
            all_vitamins = set(juices[i][1]) | set(juices[j][1]) | set(juices[k][1])
            if len(all_vitamins) == 3:
                total_price = juices[i][0] + juices[j][0] + juices[k][0]
                min_price = min(min_price, total_price)

if min_price == float('inf'):
    print(-1)
else:
    print(min_price)
```

Please note that this code has corrected the bugs mentioned in the feedback. It now correctly checks if a juice contains all three vitamins and updates the minimum price only when all three vitamins are present in a juice.
