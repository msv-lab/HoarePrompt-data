          "feedback": "### BUG 1:\nThe code initializes `min_diff` as `max_val - min_val`, which is the correct initial value. However, the code incorrectly checks if `min_diff` is greater than `k` instead of checking if `min_diff` is equal to `k`.\n\n### BUG 2:\nThe code subtracts `k` from `min_diff` when `min_diff` is greater than `k`. This is incorrect because `k` represents the maximum number of operations that can be performed, so subtracting `k` from `min_diff` suggests that the maximum number of operations has already been performed, which is not the case.\n\n### IMPACT:\nThese bugs cause the code to calculate the incorrect minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, resulting in wrong outputs. Specifically, the first bug leads to a discrepancy in the value of `min_diff`, which impacts the calculation performed in the second bug. As a result, the overall functionality of the code is flawed, and it fails to produce the expected output for the given inputs.",
