This means that the first button is skipped and only the second and third buttons are processed.\n\n2. **Intersection operation on empty set**: If there is a button that doesn't turn on any bulbs, then the intersection operation `bulbs = bulbs.intersection(switch)` will result in an empty set. However, the code does not handle this case correctly. Currently, the code breaks the loop when the intersection is empty, but this is incorrect because there might still be other buttons that can turn on the remaining bulbs.\n\n3. **Incorrect condition in if statement**: The if statement `if len(bulbs) == 0` is used both inside and outside the loop, but it should only be used outside the loop to determine the final result. Inside the loop, the condition should be `if len(bulbs) == m` to check if all bulbs have been turned on.\n\n4. **Incorrect input parsing**: The input parsing code does not correctly handle the number of bulbs turned on by each button. Currently, it only reads the first number `x_i`, but it should read `x_i+1` numbers.\n\n5. **Incorrect output format**: The code should print \"YES\" or \"NO\" without any additional characters or newline.\n\nTo fix these bugs, the following changes should be made to the code:\n\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nbulbs = set(range(1, m+1))\nswitches = [set(map(int, input().split()[1:])) for _ in range(1, n+1)]\n\nfor switch in switches:\n    bulbs = bulbs.intersection(switch)\n    if len(bulbs) == m:\n        break\n\nif len(bulbs) == m:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\nWith these changes, the code should correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output.",
