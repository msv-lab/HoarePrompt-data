I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Vasya wants to turn on Christmas lights consisting of m bulbs. Initially, all bulbs are turned off. There are n buttons, each of them is connected to some set of bulbs. Vasya can press any of these buttons. When the button is pressed, it turns on all the bulbs it's connected to. Can Vasya light up all the bulbs?

If Vasya presses the button such that some bulbs connected to it are already turned on, they do not change their state, i.e. remain turned on.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of buttons and the number of bulbs respectively. 

Each of the next n lines contains x_{i} (0 ≤ x_{i} ≤ m) — the number of bulbs that are turned on by the i-th button, and then x_{i} numbers y_{ij} (1 ≤ y_{ij} ≤ m) — the numbers of these bulbs.


-----Output-----

If it's possible to turn on all m bulbs print "YES", otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
2 1 4
3 1 3 1
1 2

Output
YES

Input
3 3
1 1
1 2
1 1

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample you can press each button once and turn on all the bulbs. In the 2 sample it is impossible to turn on the 3-rd lamp.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

            ### REVIEW

The code seems to be attempting to solve the problem correctly, but there are a few bugs that need to be fixed.

1. **Incorrect range for buttons**: The range for the buttons is incorrectly set as `range(n)` instead of `range(1, n+1)`. This means that the first button is skipped and only the second and third buttons are processed.

2. **Intersection operation on empty set**: If there is a button that doesn't turn on any bulbs, then the intersection operation `bulbs = bulbs.intersection(switch)` will result in an empty set. However, the code does not handle this case correctly. Currently, the code breaks the loop when the intersection is empty, but this is incorrect because there might still be other buttons that can turn on the remaining bulbs.

3. **Incorrect condition in if statement**: The if statement `if len(bulbs) == 0` is used both inside and outside the loop, but it should only be used outside the loop to determine the final result. Inside the loop, the condition should be `if len(bulbs) == m` to check if all bulbs have been turned on.

4. **Incorrect input parsing**: The input parsing code does not correctly handle the number of bulbs turned on by each button. Currently, it only reads the first number `x_i`, but it should read `x_i+1` numbers.

5. **Incorrect output format**: The code should print "YES" or "NO" without any additional characters or newline.

To fix these bugs, the following changes should be made to the code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

bulbs = set(range(1, m+1))
switches = [set(map(int, input().split()[1:])) for _ in range(1, n+1)]

for switch in switches:
    bulbs = bulbs.intersection(switch)
    if len(bulbs) == m:
        break

if len(bulbs) == m:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

With these changes, the code should correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output.

The code you provided has some bugs. I have analyzed the issues and provided a corrected version of the code below:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

bulbs = set(range(1, m+1))
switches = [set(map(int, input().split()[1:])) for _ in range(1, n+1)]

for switch in switches:
    bulbs = bulbs.intersection(switch)
    if len(bulbs) == m:
        break

if len(bulbs) == m:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
