          "feedback": "### BUG 1\nThe first issue with the code is in the way it calculates the minimum total time required for all people to cross the river. The current implementation calculates the total number of people who can cross the river using the recursive `dfs()` function. However, this does not account for the time it takes for each person to cross the plank.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `dfs()` function to return the total time it takes for each person to cross the river. We can do this by passing an additional argument to the `dfs()` function to keep track of the total time.\n\n#### CODE\n```python\ndef dfs(v, time):\n    visited[v] = True\n    count = 1\n    for u in adj_list[v]:\n        if not visited[u]:\n            count += dfs(u, time + 1)\n    return count * time\n```\n### BUG 2\nThe second issue is with the calculation of the `left_behind` variable. The current implementation subtracts the total count of people who can cross the river from the total number of people who need to cross. However, this does not take into account the people who have already crossed the river successfully.\n\nTo fix this, we can subtract the total count of people who can cross the river (excluding Sally who is already on the right bank) from the total number of people who need to cross.\n\n#### CODE\n```python\nleft_behind = P - total_count + 1\n```\n### BUG 3\nThe third issue is related to the initialization of the `visited` list. The current implementation initializes `visited` as a list of length `R+2`, but it should be initialized as a list of length `R+3` to account for the left and right river banks.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the initialization of `visited` to `visited = [False] * (R+3)`.\n\n#### CODE\n```python\nvisited = [False] * (R+3)\n```\n### FULL CODE\n```python\nP, R, L = map(int, input().split())\n\nadj_list = [[] for _ in range(R+2)]\nfor _ in range(L):\n    E1, E2 = map(int, input().split())\n    adj_list[E1].append(E2)\n    adj_list[E2].append(E1)\n\nvisited = [False] * (R+3)\n\ndef dfs(v, time):\n    visited[v] = True\n    count = 1\n    for u in adj_list[v]:\n        if not visited[u]:\n            count += dfs(u, time + 1)\n    return count * time\n\ntotal_count = dfs(-2, 1)\nleft_behind = P - total_count + 1\n\nif left_behind < 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print(left_behind)\n```",
