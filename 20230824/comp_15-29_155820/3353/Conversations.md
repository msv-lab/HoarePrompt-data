I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Sally and her friends are trying to cross safely from one bank of a raging river to another. Boulders are scattered within the river, with log planks connecting the banks of the river to some of the boulders, and some pairs of boulders to each other.

Sally begins by trying to cross the river first. She starts at the left bank and crosses one plank at a time, with the goal of reaching the right bank. Walking across a plank takes Sally one second. Each time she crosses a plank, that plank becomes unstable and collapses into the river (so that neither Sally nor her friends can use that plank again). After Sally has safely reached the right bank, another friend tries to cross the river, and so on, until everyone who is able to make it has crossed the river.

Given the graph of banks/boulders and planks and the number of people who need the cross the river, what is the smallest amount of total time (in seconds) required for everyone to cross the river safely? If it is impossible for all people to cross, compute the minimum number of people $n$ who must be left behind and print n people left behind.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains three integers $P$, $R$, and $L$: the number of people $P$ who must cross the river, the number of boulders $R$ in the river, and the number of logs $L$ spanning boulders/river banks. These integers satisfy $1 \leq P \leq 10$ and $0 \leq R \leq 1000$ and $0 \leq L \leq 1000$.

Then follows $L$ lines, each of which contains two integers $E_1$ and $E_2$ specifying the endpoints on one log. The values for $E_1$ and $E_2$ are in the range $[-2,R-1]$, where $-2$ signifies the left river bank, $-1$ signifies the right river bank, and all other values indicate one of the boulders in the river.

You may assume that every log has two distinct endpoints, and that no two logs span the same pair of boulders/river banks. There is no guarantee that every boulder, or even the right river bank, is reachable from the left river bank.

-----Output-----
If it is possible for all $P$ people to reach the right bank, print a single integer, the minimum total time (in seconds) required for all people to cross.

If some people must be left behind at the left bank, instead print n people left behind, where the integer $n$ is the least number of people who must be left behind.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
2 4 7
-2 0
0 -1
-2 1
1 0
2 1
2 3
3 -1
Sample Output:
6
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "6
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUG 1
The first issue with the code is in the way it calculates the minimum total time required for all people to cross the river. The current implementation calculates the total number of people who can cross the river using the recursive `dfs()` function. However, this does not account for the time it takes for each person to cross the plank.

To fix this, we need to modify the `dfs()` function to return the total time it takes for each person to cross the river. We can do this by passing an additional argument to the `dfs()` function to keep track of the total time.

#### CODE
```python
def dfs(v, time):
    visited[v] = True
    count = 1
    for u in adj_list[v]:
        if not visited[u]:
            count += dfs(u, time + 1)
    return count * time
```
### BUG 2
The second issue is with the calculation of the `left_behind` variable. The current implementation subtracts the total count of people who can cross the river from the total number of people who need to cross. However, this does not take into account the people who have already crossed the river successfully.

To fix this, we can subtract the total count of people who can cross the river (excluding Sally who is already on the right bank) from the total number of people who need to cross.

#### CODE
```python
left_behind = P - total_count + 1
```
### BUG 3
The third issue is related to the initialization of the `visited` list. The current implementation initializes `visited` as a list of length `R+2`, but it should be initialized as a list of length `R+3` to account for the left and right river banks.

To fix this, we need to modify the initialization of `visited` to `visited = [False] * (R+3)`.

#### CODE
```python
visited = [False] * (R+3)
```
### FULL CODE
```python
P, R, L = map(int, input().split())

adj_list = [[] for _ in range(R+2)]
for _ in range(L):
    E1, E2 = map(int, input().split())
    adj_list[E1].append(E2)
    adj_list[E2].append(E1)

visited = [False] * (R+3)

def dfs(v, time):
    visited[v] = True
    count = 1
    for u in adj_list[v]:
        if not visited[u]:
            count += dfs(u, time + 1)
    return count * time

total_count = dfs(-2, 1)
left_behind = P - total_count + 1

if left_behind < 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(left_behind)
```
