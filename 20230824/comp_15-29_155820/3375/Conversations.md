I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
A unicyclic graph is a graph with exactly one cycle. A spanning subgraph of a graph $G$ is a subgraph that has one component and includes all the vertices of $G$. Given a simple graph $G$, count the number of spanning unicyclic subgraphs. The illustration below shows the visualization of Sample Input/Output $1$.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $V$ and $E$, representing the number of vertices and edges of the graph $G$ respectively. ($1 \leq V \leq 17, 0 \leq E \leq V(V-1)/2$.)

The following $E$ lines each contains two integers $A_ i$ and $B_ i$, representing an edge $(A_ i, B_ i)$. It is guaranteed that $1 \leq A_ i < B_ i \leq V$ and as the graph is simple, no two pairs represent the same edge.

-----Output-----
Output one integer, representing the number of spanning unicylic subgraphs. As the number can be rather big, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4 5
1 2
1 3
2 3
1 4
2 4
Sample Output:
5
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided seems to have a few bugs. I will review the code step by step and identify the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.


#### 1. count_spanning_unicyclic_subgraphs function

##### Bug 1:
There is a bug in the count_spanning_unicyclic_subgraphs function in the line `dfs(u, v, visited, [1])`. It should be `count_cycles(u, v, visited, cycles)`. The current approach is adding `1` to the cycles list instead of updating the cycles count.

Impact:
Due to this bug, the count of cycles is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect output.


#### 2. dfs function

##### Bug 2:
There is a bug in the dfs function in the line `cycle[0] += 1`, which should be `cycles[0] += 1`. The current approach is updating the cycle count instead of the cycles count.

Impact:
Due to this bug, the count of cycles is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect output.


#### 3. count_cycles function

##### Bug 3:
There is a bug in the count_cycles function in the line `dfs(u, v, visited, [1])`. It should be `dfs(u, v, visited, cycles)`. The current approach is passing a new list `[1]` instead of the updated cycles list.

Impact:
Due to this bug, the count of cycles is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect output.


#### 4. Main program

##### Bug 4:
There is a bug in the main program where the input is read incorrectly. Instead of using `input()`, the input should be read using `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Impact:
Due to this bug, the input is not being read correctly, which can lead to incorrect output or errors.


##### Bug 5:
There is a bug in the main program where the result is printed without being converted to an integer in the line `print(result)`. It should be `print(int(result))` to ensure the output is an integer.

Impact:
Due to this bug, the output is not being printed correctly.


### Overall Impact

The bugs in the code have the following impacts on the program's functionality:
- Bug 1 affects the count of cycles, leading to incorrect output.
- Bug 2 affects the count of cycles, leading to incorrect output.
- Bug 3 affects the count of cycles, leading to incorrect output.
- Bug 4 affects the input reading, leading to incorrect output or errors.
- Bug 5 affects the output printing, leading to incorrect output.


### Suggestions

Here are a few suggestions to fix the bugs and improve the functionality of the program:

- Fix Bug 1 by changing the line `count_cycles(u, v, visited, [1])` to `count_cycles(u, v, visited, cycles)`.
- Fix Bug 2 by changing the line `cycle[0] += 1` to `cycles[0] += 1`.
- Fix Bug 3 by changing the line `dfs(u, v, visited, [1])` to `dfs(u, v, visited, cycles)`.
- Fix Bug 4 by using `sys.stdin.readline()` to read the input instead of `input()`.
- Fix Bug 5 by changing the line `print(result)` to `print(int(result))` to ensure the output is an integer.

After applying these fixes, the program should have the correct functionality and provide the expected output.
