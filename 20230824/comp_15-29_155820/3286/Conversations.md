I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Your friend Edvin loves languages. A personal favourite of his is speaking the Robber Language. For those of you not familiar with it, it is a language transformation where every consonant is doubled, with an ’o’ put in-between. The rest is kept the same. For example, the word "car" would be transformed into "cocaror". 

Your friend Edvin was going to tell you his password to his favourite website, so that you could check out how awesome it is. Edvin is sure that nobody but him and you speak the Robber Language, so he encrypted it using this simple technique, and wrote it down on a note. After trying the password and realising it does not work, you found out that Edvin was drunk during the transformation. Now you want to find out in how many ways the password might have looked originally.

You are given an encrypted password which Edvin has attempted to translate into the Robber Language. Your task is to determine how many passwords might produce the encrypted password. You may assume that the only thing Edvin did wrong, was when scanning through the word with his eyes, he sometimes missed to transform some consonants using the rule above. Edvin is not deterministic in his failures, i.e. if he missed to transform a consonant once, it is not necessary that he would miss it if it occured again later in the string.

A vowel is considered to be one of the letters "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u". A consonant is any other letter.

-----Input-----
Input consists of one encrypted password, the resulting word from Edvins translation. The word can be as long as $1000000$ characters. It will solely consist of lower case letters a-z.

-----Output-----
Output should consist of one number, the number of ways the password might have looked before Edvin translated it. Since this number may be huge, print the remainder modulo $1000009$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
car
Sample Output 1:
1

Sample Input 2:
cocar
Sample Output 2:
2
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

    for i in range(len(password)):
        # If a consonant is found

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
def count_passwords(password):
    count = 1
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

    for i in range(len(password)):
        # If a consonant is found
        if password[i] not in vowels:
            # If the previous character is a consonant or i = 0, we can double the count
            if i == 0 or password[i-1] not in vowels:
                count = (count * 2) % 1000009

    return count

password = input()
print(count_passwords(password))
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "car
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUG 1
The code is incorrectly counting the number of possible original passwords. It is currently doubling the count whenever a consonant is found, but this is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of not doubling a consonant. In the given example, the password "car" is only transformed into "cocar", so the count should be 1, not 2.

### BUG 2
The code is not correctly identifying consonants. The condition `if password[i] not in vowels:` is intended to check if the current character is a consonant, but this is incorrect. The `vowels` list only contains lowercase vowels, so any character that is not in the list will be considered a consonant. However, this does not account for other characters such as digits or special characters that may be present in the password.

### IMPACT
Bug 1: The impact of this bug is that the code is overcounting the number of possible original passwords. This means that the output will be higher than expected, leading to incorrect results.

Bug 2: The impact of this bug is that the code is not correctly identifying consonants. As a result, the count of possible passwords may not be accurate.

### SUGGESTED FIX
I will not suggest a solution as per the requirement.
