I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You’ve intercepted encrypted communications between Martian diplomats. Since Martian diplomats are often spies, you decide to decrypt the messages. While the Martians have skilled rocket tech, they lag behind in number theory considerably, which compromises their encryption protocol.

Fortunately for you, spies friendly to you have reverse engineered the Martian protocol. It turns out that the Martians are using a shift-based cipher combined with a very long one-time pad. More specifically, the decryption procedure works as follows:

Step 1: Define the function $f(x) = (33x + 1) \mod 2^{20}$.


Further define $f^1(x) = f(x)$,  $f^2(x) = f(f(x))$,  $f^3(x) = f(f(f(x)))$, and so on.

Step 2: Create a $X$ by $X$ size grid, fill the upper left corner with $f^1(0)$, the next cell to the right with $f^2(0)$, $f^3(0)$ etc. Once the top row is filled, continue to the cell below the upper left cell, and fill with $f^{X+1}(0)$. Continue this process until all rows are filled.

Step 3: Sum all the values in every column, and take those values mod $2^{20}$.

Step 4: Concatenate the base-10 representations of the column sums together, to get a very long base-10 number. For instance, if you had column sums of 10 and 12 for the first and second column, the leftmost four digits of the resulting value would be 1012.

Step 5: Convert the result of step 4 from base $10$ to base $27$. This will yield the one-time pad the Martians used.

Step 6: For each letter $l$ of the intercepted message, shift the letter by the amount given by the corresponding digit of step 5, base $27$. “Shifting” means to add the digit at the corresponding position of the pad to the value of the letter in the encrypted message and then to compute its remainder modulo $27$. You may assume that both the encrypted and the decrypted message consist of only uppercase English characters ‘A’ through ‘Z’ and spaces, which are assigned values $0 \ldots 26$ (A = 0, B = 1, ... Z = 25, SPACE = 26). Thus, if the encrypted message has letter ‘D’ in position $3$, and the $3^{\text {rd}}$ base-$27$ digit of the pad is $25$, then the decrypted letter after shifting would be $3 + 25 = 1 \mod 27$ which is ‘B’.

Step 7: Output the decrypted message.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two positive integers, $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10^6$), and $X$ ($1 \le X \le 2.5 \cdot 10^5$). It is guaranteed that the base $27$ result of step 5 will be longer or equal to the length of the intercepted message. The second line of the input contains a string consisting of uppercase letters and spaces of length $N$, the encrypted text.

-----Output-----
Output the decrypted text.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
14 4
JQ IRKEYFG EXQ
Sample Output:
THIS IS A TEST
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            The given code has several bugs. Let's discuss them in detail:

1. **Invalid Grid Initialization**: In Step 2, the code initializes the `grid` with `0` values. However, the grid size should be `X` by `X`, not `N` by `X`. This will cause an error in the later steps when trying to access elements beyond the grid size.

2. **Incorrect Position Counter**: In the nested loop for filling the grid, the `x` and `y` counters are not correctly updated. The `y` counter should only be updated when the first row is completed, i.e., when `row == X - 1`. And the `x` counter should be reset to `0` when moving to the next row.

3. **Incorrect Column Sum Calculation**: In Step 3, the code calculates the column sums using `zip(*grid)` and `sum(column)`. However, the `grid` size is incorrect and contains `0` values, so the column sums will be incorrect as well.

4. **Inefficient Base Conversion**: In Step 5, the code converts the column sums to base 10 by concatenating the digits one by one. This approach is inefficient and time-consuming, especially for large numbers. It would be better to use a built-in function or algorithm for base conversion.

5. **Index Error in Base Conversion**: In the base conversion loop, the code tries to access `base_27_pad[i]` without checking if `i` is within the valid range of indices. This will cause an `IndexError` when the length of `base_27_pad` is less than `N`.

6. **Invalid Character Mapping**: In Step 6, the code assumes that the uppercase English characters 'A' through 'Z' and spaces are assigned values `0` through `26`. However, this mapping is incorrect. The valid mapping should be `A` = `0`, `B` = `1`, ..., `Z` = `25`, and `SPACE` = `26`.

7. **Missing Space Handling**: In Step 6, the code doesn't handle the special case where the encrypted letter is a space. The decryption process should ignore spaces and leave them unchanged.

8. **Incorrect Output Printing**: The code concatenates the decrypted letters into a string variable `decrypted_text`, but it doesn't print the final decrypted message. The expected output should be printed using the `print` function.

To fix these bugs, the code needs to be modified as follows:

This modified code should fix the bugs mentioned above and produce the expected output.
