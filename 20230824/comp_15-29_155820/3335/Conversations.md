I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Simon Haples is a somewhat peculiar person. Not quite hip, not quite square, he is more of a triangular nature: ever since childhood, he has had an almost unhealthy obsession with triangles. Because of his discrete nature, Simon’s favorite kind of triangles are the Pythagorean ones, in which the side lengths are three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a \le b$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 

Recently, Simon has discovered the fantastic world of counting modulo some integer $n$. As you may imagine, he quickly realizes that there are multitudes of Pythagorean triples to which he has previously been oblivious! Simon therefore sets out to find all Pythagorean triples modulo $n$, i.e., all triples of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ between $1$ and $n-1$ such that $a \le b$ and $a^2 + b^2 \equiv c^2 \pmod{n}$.

As Simon’s best friend, you realize that there is not much hope in deterring Simon from his crazy plans, so you decide to help him by computing how many such triples there are, so that Simon will know when his work is done.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single integer $n$, satisfying $2 \le n \le 500000$.

-----Output-----
Output the number of Pythagorean triples modulo $n$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
7
Sample Output:
18
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "7
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "18
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Feedback

#### Bug 1: Loop range
The bug occurs in the loop range for variable `b`. The range should start from `a` and end at `n`, rather than starting from `a` and ending at `n-1`. 

The bug impacts the program's functionality because it prevents the code from iterating through all possible values of `b`, resulting in missed Pythagorean triples.

#### Bug 2: Incorrect modulo calculation
The bug occurs in the calculation of `c` modulo `n` using the expression `c % n == 0`. This logic is incorrect because it checks if `c` is divisible by `n`, rather than checking if `c^2` is congruent to `a^2 + b^2` modulo `n`.

The bug impacts the program's functionality because it incorrectly identifies Pythagorean triples, leading to an incorrect count of the triples modulo `n`.

#### Bug 3: Missing conversion to integer
The bug occurs when calculating `c` using the expression `(a**2 + b**2)**0.5`. Although `a` and `b` are integers, the resulting `c` will generally be a floating-point number. This can cause issues when comparing `c` modulo `n` with 0, as the result may not be exactly 0 or may not be an integer.

The bug impacts the program's functionality because it leads to incorrect identification of Pythagorean triples, resulting in an incorrect count of the triples modulo `n`.

### Revised code:
```python
import math

n = int(input())

count = 0

for a in range(1, n):
    for b in range(a, n):  # Fixed bug 1: Corrected loop range
        c = int((a**2 + b**2)**0.5)  # Fixed bug 3: Converted c to an integer
        if (a**2 + b**2) % n == c**2 % n:  # Fixed bug 2: Corrected modulo calculation
            count += 1

print(count)
```

Please note that the revised code addresses the identified bugs and should provide correct output. However, I recommend carefully testing the code with various inputs to confirm its correctness. Keep in mind the potential limitations of large values of `n` in terms of execution time and memory usage.

I apologize for the confusion. Here's the complete revised code:

```python
import math

n = int(input())

count = 0

for a in range(1, n):
    for b in range(a, n):
        c = (a**2 + b**2) % n
        if c*c % n == (a**2 + b**2) % n:
            count += 1

print(count)
```

This code should correctly calculate the number of Pythagorean triples modulo `n`. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous incomplete response.
