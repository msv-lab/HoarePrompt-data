I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
A scavenger hunt is being organized for programming contest participants. In addition to the starting and ending locations of the race, there are $n$ ($n \leq 20$) other locations for competitors to travel to. At each location $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$), there is a task that must be performed to earn $p_ i$ points. The task at each location takes $t_ i$ minutes to complete. However, each task can only be performed once, so a competitor may not travel to the same location more than once. The competitor cannot return to the starting location after the race begins, and the race finishes as soon as the ending location is reached. 

The scavenger hunt must be completed within $T$ minutes. That is, the time between leaving the starting location and arriving at the ending location must be no more than $T$ minutes. In addition, some tasks have a specific deadline $d_ i$, meaning that the task must be completed within $d_ i$ minutes since leaving the starting location. Again, note that if a competitor arrives at location $i$, the task at location $i$ must be performed. If the competitor were to arrive at the location too late and would not finish the task at that location by the deadline, then the competitor would not be allowed to travel to the location at all.

What is the maximum total number of points that can be obtained from the tasks?

-----Input-----
The input consists of one case. The first line of input contains two positive integers $n$ and $T$ ($T \leq 1440$). Each of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $p_ i$ ($1 \leq p_ i \leq 100$), $t_ i$ ($1 \leq t_ i \leq 1440$), and $d_ i$ ($-1 \leq d_ i \leq 1440$). If $d_ i = -1$ then there is no deadline for task $i$. Finally, the last $n+2$ lines each contains $n+2$ nonnegative integers. The entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column is the number of minutes ($\leq 1440$) it takes to travel from location $i$ to location $j$. The indices of the starting and ending locations are $n+1$ and $n+2$, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the time to travel from a location to itself is $0$, but the time to travel between two locations in different directions may not be the same (e.g. uphill instead of downhill).

-----Output-----
Print the maximum total number of points that can be obtained on the first line. In the second line, print a set of indices of the tasks that need to be performed to achieve this maximum. The list of tasks should be sorted by the indices of the tasks (not by the order in which they are performed). The indices should be separated by a single space. If there are multiple sets of tasks that can achieve the maximum, print the one that is lexicographically smallest. That is, if two sets of tasks achieve the same maximum, the index of the first task in the set should be as small as possible. If there is a tie, the index of the second task in the set should be as small as possible, and so on.

If the maximum number of points that can be obtained is $0$, output a blank line for the indices of the tasks to be performed.

If there is no way of travelling from the starting location to the ending location within $T$ minutes, print $0$.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3 352
93 82 444
92 76 436
99 62 -1
0 70 66 71 97
76 0 87 66 74
62 90 0 60 94
60 68 68 0 69
83 78 83 73 0
Sample Output:
99
3
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the code that need to be fixed:

1. The code does not check if it is possible to reach the ending location within the given time limit. If it is not possible, the code should return 0.
2. The code incorrectly calculates the maximum points for each task. The condition for adding points to dp[i][j] is incorrect.
3. The code does not handle the case when there is no deadline for a task correctly. It should check if dp[i - 1][j + times[k][i]] + tasks[i - 1][0] > dp[i][j] only if tasks[i - 1][2] == -1.
4. The code incorrectly finds the path from the ending location to the starting location. The starting location should be n+1 and the ending location should be n+2.
5. The code incorrectly prints the indices of the tasks. The indices should be sorted in ascending order, but the code just reverses the list.

Let's go through each of these bugs in detail.

Bug 1: Check if it is possible to reach the ending location within the given time limit.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check after the dynamic programming loop to ensure that it is possible to reach the ending location within the given time limit. If it is not possible, we should return 0. The check can be done by comparing dp[n+1][j], where n+1 is the ending location, with 0.

Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of maximum points for each task.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition on line 19 to check if dp[i - 1][j + times[k][i]] + tasks[i - 1][0] is greater than dp[i][j], rather than just checking if it is greater than 0.

Bug 3: Incorrect handling of tasks with no deadline.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition on line 16 to check if tasks[i - 1][2] is equal to -1, rather than checking if it is not equal to -1. This ensures that the condition is only applied when there is no deadline for the task.

Bug 4: Incorrect finding of the path from the ending location to the starting location.

To fix this bug, we need to update the loop on line 26 to iterate from n+1 to 0, rather than from n to 0. We also need to update the if condition on line 27 to check if prev[i][j] is -1, rather than checking if it is not equal to -1. Additionally, we need to update the starting location to n+1 and the ending location to n+2.

Bug 5: Incorrect printing of the indices of the tasks.

To fix this bug, we need to sort the path list in ascending order before printing it, so that the indices are printed in the correct order.

Now let's update the code to fix these bugs.

I apologize for the confusion. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import itertools

# Read input
n, T = map(int, input().split())
tasks = []
for _ in range(n):
    p, t, d = map(int, input().split())
    tasks.append((p, t, d))
times = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n + 2)]

# Calculate the maximum points using dynamic programming
dp = [[0] * (T + 1) for _ in range(n + 2)]
prev = [[-1] * (T + 1) for _ in range(n + 2)]
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(T + 1):
        if tasks[i - 1][2] != -1 and tasks[i - 1][2] < j:
            continue
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        prev[i][j] = j
        for k in range(n + 2):
            if k != i:
                if tasks[i - 1][2] == -1 or (j + times[k][i] <= T and dp[i - 1][j + times[k][i]] + tasks[i - 1][0] > dp[i][j]):
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j + times[k][i]] + tasks[i - 1][0]
                    prev[i][j] = k

# Check if it is possible to reach the ending location within the given time limit
if dp[n + 1][T] == 0:
    print(0)
    print('')
else:
    # Find the path from the ending location to the starting location
    path = []
    j = T
    for i in range(n + 1, 0, -1):
        if prev[i][j] == -1:
            break
        path.append(i)
        j = prev[i][j]
    path.sort()

    # Print the maximum points and the indices of the tasks
    print(dp[n + 1][T])
    print(' '.join(map(str, path)))
```

Please give it a try with your test case and let me know if it works correctly.
