I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Nudgémon GO is a game in which players should earn as much experience points (XP) as possible, by catching and evolving Nudgémon. You gain 100 XP for catching a Nudgémon and 500 XP for evolving a Nudgémon. Your friend has been playing this game a lot recently, but you believe that his strategy is not optimal.

All Nudgémon are split into families, each of which has its own unique type of candy. The Nudgémon in a family are ranked from weakest to strongest and hence form a chain. Any Nudgémon that is not the strongest from its family can be evolved to the next ranked Nudgémon from the same family.

Candies are a fundamental currency in the Nudgémon universe:
 - When you catch a Nudgémon you earn 3 candies, all associated with the Nudgémon’s family.
 - When you irreversibly transfer a Nudgémon away from your possession, you earn 1 candy associated with the Nudgémon’s family.

Every evolution of a Nudgémon consumes a specific amount of its family’s kind of candy. Furthermore, the costs of evolutions along the family chain are non-decreasing, meaning that higher-ranked evolutions in the family will cost the same or more as lower ones.

Here is an example of possible Nudgémon evolutions:


Apart from making the developers money and nudging ’em all, the goal of this game is to earn as much XP as possible to level up the player’s character and be able to encounter stronger Nudgémon in the wild. As such, coinciding with the first goal, you can buy a Blessed Egg with real money in the game. This item allows you to double your earned XP for the next 30 minutes since activation, i.e. when the Egg is activated at time $e$ (in seconds since the start of the game), for any action taken on time $t$, you will earn double XP if and only if $e \leq t < e + 1800$.

At the start of the game your friend received a single Blessed Egg. Unfortunately, he completely wasted it. You believe that it is better to only evolve Nudgémon while the Blessed Egg is active, otherwise it is a huge waste of resources! To prove your point to your friend, you took a log of all Nudgémon he caught with timestamps and decided to calculate the maximum amount of XP he could have had right now if he was strategic about when to activate his Blessed Egg and only evolved Nudgémon during the time it was active.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
 - one line containing an integer $f$ ($0 \leq f \leq 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon families;
 - $f$ lines describing a family of Nudgémon, where each line consists of the following elements:
 - an integer $s_ i$ ($1 \le s_ i \leq 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon in this family;
 - $s_ i-1$ times the name of a Nudgémon, followed by an integer $c_ j$ ($1 \le c_ j \leq 10^5$), the amount of candies (of appropriate type) consumed by evolving this Nudgémon;
 - the name of the strongest Nudgémon in this family;
 - one line containing an integer $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon your friend caught;
 - $n$ lines containing an integer $t_ i$ ($0 \leq t_ i \leq 10^9$) and a string $p_ i$, the time at which the Nudgémon was caught and the name of the caught Nudgémon.

It is guaranteed that there are at most $10^5$ Nudgémon kinds ($\sum _{i} s_ i \leq 10^5$). The Nudgémon in each family are given in order of increasing rank, and thus the values of $c$ in one family are non-decreasing. Every Nudgémon name is a string of between $1$ and $20$ lowercase letters. The times $t_ i$ are non-decreasing (your friend is so quick he can catch multiple Nudgémon in a single second). No Nudgémon name appears more than once within a family or within more than one family, and all $n$ Nudgémon that are caught belong to one of the families.

-----Output-----
Output the maximum amount of XP your friend could have had at the current time had he activated his Blessed Egg at the optimal time and only evolved Nudgémon during the time it was active.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3
3 caterpillar 3 pupa 7 butterfly
3 dove 3 pigeon 7 aaabaaajss
3 mouse 1 electromouse 5 rat
7
0 electromouse
500 electromouse
1000 electromouse
1500 rat
2000 aaabaaajss
2500 pigeon
3000 butterfly
Sample Output:
5100
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "57
" but the expected output was "5100
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            There are several bugs in the provided code. Let's analyze them one by one:

1. The calculation of `max_xp` is incorrect. The current code is simply multiplying the number of Nudgémon in each family (`family[1]`) by 100. However, this calculation should only be done for the first Nudgémon in each family. For the subsequent Nudgémon, we need to add the evolution XP cost (`xp_cost`) multiplied by 500 to `max_xp`.

2. The calculation of `xp` is also incorrect. The code is multiplying `family[1]` by 3 for each family, which is the correct calculation for the first Nudgémon in each family. However, for subsequent Nudgémon, we need to add the evolution XP cost (`xp_cost`) multiplied by 3 to `xp`.

3. The loop that calculates `max_xp_time` is not working as intended. The code is comparing `max_xp` to `max_xp_time` and updating `max_xp_time` if `max_xp` is greater. However, this calculation should be done after the loop that calculates `max_xp` for each family.

4. The loop that checks for the activation of the Blessed Egg is not correctly implemented. The code is checking if `pokemon` is equal to "BlessedEgg" to activate the egg. However, according to the problem statement, the Blessed Egg should be activated at the optimal time, which is the time when `max_xp` is reached. Additionally, the condition `time >= max_xp_time and pokemon != "BlessedEgg"` should be changed to `time >= max_xp_time or pokemon == "BlessedEgg"`, because we want to activate the Blessed Egg when the time is greater than or equal to `max_xp_time`, or if the caught Nudgémon is the Blessed Egg itself.

5. The `xp` variable is not being updated during the iteration over the caught Nudgémon. This variable should be updated whenever a caught Nudgémon is evolved and the Blessed Egg is active.

6. The function does not return the correct variable. The variable `xp` should be returned instead of `max_xp`.

Now let's discuss the impact of these bugs on the program's functionality:

- The incorrect calculation of `max_xp` and `xp` leads to incorrect values for the total XP that can be obtained by evolving Nudgémon. This will result in an incorrect calculation of the maximum amount of XP that the friend could have had at the current time.

- The incorrect calculation of `max_xp_time` can lead to the Blessed Egg not being activated at the optimal time, resulting in a lower total XP.

- The incorrect loop that checks for the activation of the Blessed Egg can result in the egg not being activated at all, even if it could have been activated at the optimal time.

- The incorrect condition in the loop that checks for the activation of the Blessed Egg can result in missed opportunities to activate the egg, resulting in a lower total XP.

- The `xp` variable not being updated during the iteration over the caught Nudgémon can result in a lower total XP, as not all evolved Nudgémon will have the XP doubled by the Blessed Egg.

- Finally, the function returns the incorrect variable, which means that the calculated XP is not correctly returned.

Overall, these bugs have a significant impact on the program's functionality, resulting in a lower total XP than expected.
