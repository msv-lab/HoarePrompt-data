          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\nThe given code aims to determine the number of matches for which Julia is guaranteed to stay in the lead. However, there are a few bugs in the code that lead to incorrect results.\n\n#### 1. Incorrect Condition\nIn the for loop, the code checks if `p` is equal to `max_points`. This condition is incorrect because it only counts the number of bettors who have the same number of points as Julia. However, the requirement is to count the number of bettors who have strictly more points than Julia.\n\n#### 2. Logic Flaw\nEven if the correct condition is used, the logic of the code is flawed. The code incorrectly assumes that Julia is always guaranteed to stay in the lead if there is at least one other bettor with more points. However, this may not be the case in all scenarios.\n\n#### 3. Incorrect Calculation\nThe code only counts the number of bettors who have more points than Julia. It does not account for the remaining matches and their potential impact on Julia's position. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of matches Julia is guaranteed to stay in the lead.\n\n### BUGS\n1. Incorrect condition to check if bettors have more points than Julia.\n2. Flawed logic assuming Julia is always guaranteed to stay in the lead if there is at least one other bettor with more points.\n3. Incorrect calculation of the number of matches Julia is guaranteed to stay in the lead.\n\n### IMPACT\nDue to the bugs, the current code provides incorrect results. It underestimates the number of matches for which Julia is guaranteed to stay in the lead. As a result, the code fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.",
