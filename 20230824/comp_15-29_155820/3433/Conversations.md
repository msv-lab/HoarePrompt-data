I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Joe works in a maze. Unfortunately, portions of the maze have caught on fire, and the owner of the maze neglected to create a fire escape plan. Help Joe escape the maze.

Given Joe’s location in the maze and which squares of the maze are on fire, you must determine whether Joe can exit the maze before the fire reaches him, and how fast he can do it.

Joe and the fire each move one square per minute, vertically or horizontally (not diagonally). The fire spreads all four directions from each square that is on fire. Joe may exit the maze from any square that borders the edge of the maze. Neither Joe nor the fire may enter a square that is occupied by a wall.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains the two integers $R$ and $C$, separated by spaces, with $1 \le R, C \le 1000$. The following $R$ lines of input each contain one row of the maze. Each of these lines contains exactly $C$ characters, and each of these characters is one of:
 - #, a wall
 - ., a passable square
 - J, Joe’s initial position in the maze, which is a passable square
 - F, a square that is on fire

There will be exactly one J in the input.

-----Output-----
Output a single line containing “IMPOSSIBLE” if Joe cannot exit the maze before the fire reaches him, or an integer giving the earliest time Joe can safely exit the maze, in minutes.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4 4
####
#JF#
#..#
#..#
Sample Output:
3
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided attempts to find the earliest time for Joe to escape from a maze before the fire reaches him. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze and determine the minimum number of minutes it takes for Joe to reach an exit.

Here are the bugs and issues I found in the code:

1. **Bug**: The BFS loop termination condition is incorrect. The code currently checks if Joe's position `(x, y)` is at the edge of the maze, but it should be checking if Joe's position is adjacent to an edge square.
   - In the case where Joe is already at an edge square, the code incorrectly terminates the BFS loop without checking if that edge square is an exit. This can lead to incorrect results.
   - Additionally, the check `x == 0 or x == R-1 or y == 0 or y == C-1` is missing the condition where the current `(x, y)` position is not an edge square, but its adjacent neighbors are.
   - This bug affects the correctness of the algorithm and can cause incorrect results for certain maze configurations.

2. **Bug**: The grid construction is incorrect. The code constructs the `grid` matrix by appending characters to existing rows in the `grid` list. However, this results in all rows referencing the same list. Modifying one row will affect all other rows. It is necessary to create separate lists for each row in the `grid`.
   - This bug affects the correctness of the algorithm and can cause unexpected behavior when modifying the grid.

3. **Bug**: The visited matrix is not updated correctly. The code sets `visited[new_x][new_y] = True` immediately after checking if the position `(new_x, new_y)` is valid. However, this can lead to incorrect results because the position may be set as visited even if it is a wall or on fire.
   - Additionally, the `visited` matrix is not used effectively. It is only used to prevent revisiting the same location, but it does not prevent Joe from moving into a location that was previously visited.
   - This bug affects the correctness of the algorithm and can lead to Joe entering squares that were already visited.

4. **Issue**: The `is_valid` function can be simplified. The `is_valid` function currently checks if the position `(x, y)` is within the bounds of the maze (`0 <= x < R` and `0 <= y < C`). This can be simplified by directly checking the conditions in the BFS loop.
   - Although this is not a bug, simplifying the function can improve code readability.

5. **Issue**: The code does not handle the case where Joe is already at an exit square. If Joe's initial position is already on an edge square, the BFS loop should terminate and return 0 as the earliest time.
   - Although this is not a bug, handling this case explicitly can improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

6. **Issue**: The `fire` list is not used in the BFS algorithm. The code constructs a list of fire positions, but it does not utilize this information when propagating the fire in the maze.
   - Although this is not a bug, the fire position information is not used, which may impact the algorithm's accuracy or efficiency.

These are the main bugs and issues I found in the code. Fixing these issues should help correct the program and produce the expected output.
