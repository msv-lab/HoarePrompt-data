I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
In the USA, a type of dance called square dance is very popular. Four dancing pairs stand as to form a square. A caller then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor.

American wizards, however, find square dancing a bit simplistic. Instead, they have come up with a kind of dance called circle dancing. In the dance, $N$ wizards stand in a circle numbered $1$ through $N$ clockwise. A caller then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor. Each such move has the following form. Every wizard is given a number $p_ i$. They then all teleport simultaneously $p_ i$ positions clockwise or counterclockwise in the ring. For example, given the number 1 they should move to one of the two places immediately adjacent to their current position.

After a move is performed, no two wizards may occupy the same position. This means a certain amount of coordination is required when teleporting. Can you tell the wizards how they should teleport in order to not collide with each other?

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 300000$), the number of wizards. The next line contains the $N$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_ N$ ($0 \le p_ i < N$). The wizards are numbered $1, 2, \dots , N$ clockwise in the circle.

-----Output-----
Output a string with $N$ characters. The $i$’th character should be L if the $i$’th wizard should teleport clockwise, and R if he should teleport counterclockwise. If there are multiple valid solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no valid solution, output no dance.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
3
1 1 1
Sample Output 1:
LLL

Sample Input 2:
5
1 2 2 1 2
Sample Output 2:
LLRLR
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code provided.

1. **Incorrect handling of moves**: The code does not correctly handle the teleportation moves for the wizards. For a wizard with a move value of 0 or `N-1`, the code incorrectly assigns `'L'` or `'R'` respectively. Additionally, for wizards with even move values, the code assigns `'R'` and for odd move values, the code assigns `'L'`. This does not necessarily ensure that the wizards will not collide.

2. **Missing check for valid solution**: The code does not check if there is a valid solution where no wizards collide. It simply assigns `'L'` or `'R'` to each wizard based on their move values.

3. **Missing handling for no valid solution**: The code does not handle the case where there is no valid solution, i.e. where it is not possible for the wizards to perform the dance without colliding. It does not provide any output in this case.

4. **Inconsistent handling of input**: The code uses both the `input()` function and a function parameter to read input. This inconsistency can cause confusion and errors.

Now let's discuss the impact of these bugs on the functionality of the program.

The incorrect handling of moves can lead to incorrect assignment of teleportation directions to the wizards. This means that the output may not represent a valid solution where wizards do not collide. This can potentially lead to incorrect dances being performed.

The missing check for a valid solution means that the code does not verify if the assigned teleportation directions will indeed prevent collisions. The code assumes that assigning `'L'` or `'R'` based on the move values will always result in a valid solution, which is not necessarily true.

The missing handling for no valid solution means that if there is no way for the wizards to perform the dance without colliding, the code will still provide an output. This can be misleading and lead to incorrect results.

The inconsistent handling of input can lead to confusion and potential errors or incorrect results. It is better to have a consistent approach for reading input throughout the code.

Now let's move on to identifying the bugs in the code and discussing their impact in detail.

The first bug in the code is in the `circle_dance` function. The logic to assign the teleportation directions to the wizards is incorrect. Let's go through the code line by line to understand the issue.

```python
def circle_dance(N, moves):
    positions = [''] * N
    for i in range(N):
        if moves[i] == 0:
            positions[i] = 'L'
        elif moves[i] == N - 1:
            positions[i] = 'R'
        elif moves[i] % 2 == 0:
            positions[i] = 'R'
        else:
            positions[i] = 'L'
    return "".join(positions)
```

The code starts by initializing an empty list `positions` with `N` empty strings.

Then it loops over the range from `0` to `N-1`, assigning teleportation directions based on the move values.

The first conditional statement `moves[i] == 0` assigns `'L'` to the wizard if their move value is `0`.

The second conditional statement `moves[i] == N - 1` assigns `'R'` to the wizard if their move value is equal to `N-1`.

The third conditional statement `moves[i] % 2 == 0` assigns `'R'` to the wizard if their move value is even.

If none of the above conditions are met, the else block `positions[i] = 'L'` assigns `'L'` to the wizard.

Let's analyze the impact of this bug on the functionality of the code.

When a wizard has a move value of `0`, they are correctly assigned `'L'`. However, the logic for assigning `'R'` to the wizards is incorrect. If a wizard has a move value of `N-1` or an even move value, the code incorrectly assigns `'R'` to them. This logic does not guarantee that the wizards will not collide.

To fix this bug, we need to come up with a correct strategy to assign teleportation directions to the wizards in such a way that they do not collide. Let's move on to the next bug in the code.
