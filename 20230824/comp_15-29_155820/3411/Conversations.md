I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Nick is a bird watcher and often visits the forum “CrowFinders” to discuss his hobby with like-minded people. CrowFinders has a voting system where users can upvote or downvote comments, which increases or decreases their score by $1$. This means that each comment can end up with any integer score (including negative scores). Once when Nick was browsing a heated discussion about the classification of jackdaws as crows, he found something very pleasing: a chain of comments that alternated between positive and negative scores. But a few days later, he found that the comment chain was no longer alternating. Now Nick wants to make it alternating again. 

A comment chain is alternating if the scores $s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_ n$ of the comments all are non-zero, and every pair of adjacent scores $s_ i$, $s_{i+1}$ have opposite signs. In particular, a single comment with a non-zero score or even a comment chain without any comment is an alternating comment chain.

There are two operations Nick can do to make the comment chain alternating:
 - Create a fake account and upvote/downvote some of the comments. This increases/decreases their respective scores by $1$. Each fake account can only upvote/downvote each comment at most once, but it can vote on any subset of the comments. It takes $c$ seconds to create an account and use it to vote (regardless of how many comments are upvoted/downvoted).
 - Report one specific comment to remove it from the chain. Thinking of convincing reasons for the report takes $r$ seconds. (Nick is an excellent arguer, so once the report is filed, the comment is guaranteed to be removed.)

Nick can apply these operations in any order, any number of times. How fast can he make the comment chain alternating?

For example, consider Sample Input 1 below, where the scores in the comment chain are $8, 8, 2, -2$, and it takes Nick $10$ seconds to create an account and $50$ seconds to file a report for one comment. In this case it is optimal to first create $3$ fake accounts and use them to upvote the fourth comment and downvote the third, followed by reporting the first comment. This results in the scores $8, -1, 1$, which is an alternating chain. The time used for this is $80$ seconds.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
 - One line with three integers $n$, $c$, and $r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq c,r \leq 10^9$), the number of comments in the chain, the time it takes to create a fake account and the time it takes to report one comment respectively.
 - One line with $n$ integers $s_1, \ldots , s_ n$ ($-10^9 \leq s_ i \leq 10^9$ for all $i$), the current score of each comment in the chain.

-----Output-----
Output the smallest time to make the comment chain alternating by applying the operations above.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4 10 50
8 8 2 -2
Sample Output:
80
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "110

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The input is read correctly and the necessary variables are initialized. However, there are several bugs in the code that produce incorrect results.

First, let's understand the logic behind the code. The code attempts to make the comment chain alternating by creating fake accounts to upvote or downvote comments and by reporting comments to remove them from the chain.

The code begins by counting the number of adjacent pairs with the same sign. This count is stored in the variable `same_sign_count`. However, the way this count is computed is incorrect. The code multiplies each pair of adjacent scores and checks if the result is positive. If it is positive, it increments `same_sign_count`. But this approach will only work if both scores are non-zero. If any of the scores is zero, the multiplication will be zero and the count will not be incremented correctly.

After calculating the `same_sign_count`, the code attempts to calculate the number of fake accounts needed to create an alternating chain. This calculation is done by subtracting 1 from `same_sign_count` and taking the absolute value of the result. This logic assumes that `same_sign_count` is greater than or equal to 1, which may not be true. If `same_sign_count` is 0, we should not subtract 1 from it, as this will result in -1.

Next, the code calculates the time required to create the fake accounts by multiplying `fake_accounts_needed` by `c`. This calculation is correct.

The code also calculates the time required to remove comments from the chain by multiplying `r` by `same_sign_count`. This calculation is correct.

Finally, the code adds the `fake_accounts_time` and `removal_time` to get the total time required to make the comment chain alternating.

Overall, the bugs in the code are as follows:
- The calculation of `same_sign_count` is incorrect and may not give the desired result.
- The calculation of `fake_accounts_needed` is incorrect and may result in a negative number.
- The code does not handle cases where the comment chain is already alternating correctly.

These bugs impact the functionality of the program as they may lead to incorrect calculations and incorrect results. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the comment chain is already alternating correctly, which means it may not give the correct result even when the input is valid.

To fix these bugs, the logic for calculating `same_sign_count` and `fake_accounts_needed` needs to be modified. Additionally, the code needs to handle cases where the comment chain is already alternating correctly.

### BUGGY CODE
```python
n, c, r = map(int, input().split())
scores = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the number of adjacent pairs with the same sign
same_sign_count = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    if scores[i] * scores[i+1] > 0:
        same_sign_count += 1

# Calculate the number of fake accounts needed to create an alternating chain
fake_accounts_needed = abs(same_sign_count - 1)

# Calculate the time required to create the fake accounts
fake_accounts_time = fake_accounts_needed * c

# Calculate the time required to remove comments
removal_time = r * same_sign_count

# Calculate the total time required
total_time = fake_accounts_time + removal_time

print(total_time)
```
### CORRECT CODE
```python
n, c, r = map(int, input().split())
scores = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of adjacent pairs with the same sign
same_sign_count = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    if scores[i] != 0 and scores[i+1] != 0 and scores[i] * scores[i+1] > 0:
        same_sign_count += 1

# Calculate the number of fake accounts needed to create an alternating chain
if same_sign_count >= 2:
    fake_accounts_needed = abs(same_sign_count - 2)
else:
    fake_accounts_needed = 0

# Calculate the time required to create the fake accounts
fake_accounts_time = fake_accounts_needed * c

# Calculate the time required to remove comments
removal_time = r * same_sign_count

# Check if the comment chain is already alternating
if same_sign_count == n - 1:
    print(0)
else:
    # Calculate the total time required
    total_time = fake_accounts_time + removal_time

    print(total_time)
```
The correct code includes the following changes:

- The calculation of `same_sign_count` has been modified to take into account the case where one of the scores is zero. The condition `scores[i] != 0 and scores[i+1] != 0` has been added to the if statement.
- The calculation of `fake_accounts_needed` has been modified to handle cases where `same_sign_count` is less than 2. If `same_sign_count` is less than 2, `fake_accounts_needed` is set to 0.
- A check has been added to see if the comment chain is already alternating. If `same_sign_count` is equal to `n - 1`, the print statement is modified to print 0, indicating that no further operations are needed to make the comment chain alternating.
- The code now correctly handles cases where the comment chain is already alternating by outputting 0 as the total time required.
