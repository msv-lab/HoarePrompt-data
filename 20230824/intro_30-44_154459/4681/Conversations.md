I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5
" the output was "13
" but the expected output was "11
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### CODE REVIEW

The code provided is a Python program that aims to calculate the N-th Lucas number. 

Let's start by understanding the algorithm used in the code:

1. If the input N is 0, it returns 2
2. If the input N is 1, it returns 1
3. Otherwise, it initializes two variables, `l_minus_1` and `l_minus_2`, with initial values 1 and 2, respectively.
4. It then enters a loop from 2 to N, and in each iteration, calculates the current Lucas number `l_i` as the sum of the previous two Lucas numbers `l_minus_1` and `l_minus_2`.
5. At the end of the loop, it updates `l_minus_1` and `l_minus_2` with the current `l_i` value.
6. Finally, it returns the calculated N-th Lucas number.

Now, let's analyze the issues present in the code:

1. **Incorrect initial values**: The code sets `l_minus_1` to 1 and `l_minus_2` to 2. However, the correct initial values for `l_minus_1` and `l_minus_2` should be 1 and 1, respectively, since L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1. This will lead to incorrect results for `l_i` in the subsequent iterations.

2. **Off-by-one error in the loop**: The loop for calculating `l_i` ranges from 2 to N+1. However, since Python ranges are exclusive for the upper bound, the loop should range from 2 to N instead. Otherwise, an additional iteration is performed, resulting in an incorrect value for `l_i`.

3. **Inefficient calculation**: The code uses a loop to calculate the N-th Lucas number. While this approach is correct, it is not efficient for larger values of N. Since the Lucas numbers follow a recursive definition, they can be calculated using a more efficient algorithm, such as matrix exponentiation or memoization. However, for the given constraints (N ≤ 86), the current implementation should produce results within a reasonable time frame.

Now that we have identified the bugs in the code, let's move on to the impact they have on the program's functionality:

- Bug 1: Incorrect initial values

The code sets `l_minus_1` to 1 and `l_minus_2` to 2 instead of 1 and 1. This leads to incorrect values for `l_i` in the subsequent iterations. For example, when calculating the 4th Lucas number, the incorrect value of `l_i` would be 3 instead of 4. This bug affects all subsequent Lucas numbers, leading to incorrect results.

- Bug 2: Off-by-one error in the loop

The loop for calculating `l_i` ranges from 2 to N+1 instead of 2 to N. Due to the exclusive upper bound of Python ranges, an additional iteration is performed, resulting in an incorrect value for `l_i`. For example, when calculating the 5th Lucas number, the incorrect value of `l_i` would be 13 instead of 11. This bug affects the final result of the Lucas number calculation.

- Bug 3: Inefficient calculation

While not technically a bug, it is worth noting that the current implementation is not optimal for larger values of N. The code iteratively calculates the Lucas numbers using a loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(N). However, there are more efficient algorithms, such as matrix exponentiation or memoization, that can calculate Lucas numbers in O(log N) time. However, for the given constraints (N ≤ 86), the current implementation should produce results within a reasonable time frame.

To summarize, the bugs in the code include incorrect initial values, an off-by-one error in the loop, and an inefficient calculation algorithm. These bugs lead to incorrect results for the N-th Lucas number, as observed in the provided sample case.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
Now I will provide the correct implementation of the code based on the feedback received.

#@!CODE START!@#
def lucas_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        l_minus_1 = 1
        l_minus_2 = 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            l_i = l_minus_1 + l_minus_2
            l_minus_1 = l_minus_2
            l_minus_2 = l_i
        return l_i

N = int(input())
result = lucas_number(N)
print(result)
#@!CODE END!@#

The issues have been fixed in the following manner:

1. Incorrect initial values: The initial values of `l_minus_1` and `l_minus_2` have been changed to 1 in order to correctly calculate the Lucas numbers. Now the correct initial values are assigned.

2. Off-by-one error in the loop: The loop for calculating `l_i` now ranges from 2 to N instead of 2 to N+1. This ensures that the loop iterates the correct number of times and produces the correct N-th Lucas number.

3. Inefficient calculation: The calculation method remains the same, iterating over the loop to calculate the N-th Lucas number. While there are more efficient algorithms available, the given constraints (N ≤ 86) make the current implementation sufficient to produce results within a reasonable time frame.

With these fixes, the code should now correctly calculate the N-th Lucas number for the given input.
