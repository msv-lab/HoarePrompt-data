I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### Requirement
You will NOT SUGGEST SOLUTION, because the user wants to fix the bugs themselves.

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the provided code. Let's analyze them one by one:

1. Issue: The code is not correctly identifying the start and end tags.
   - Bug: The code checks for the character `<` to identify the start tag, which is correct. However, it checks for the character `>` to identify the end tag, which is incorrect. In XML, the end tag is identified by `</`.
   - Impact: This bug results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum level of nesting.

2. Issue: The code does not handle self-closing tags properly.
   - Bug: The code only increments the `current_level` variable when it encounters a start tag, and decrements it when it encounters an end tag. However, it does not handle self-closing tags, which should not change the current level.
   - Impact: This bug results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum level of nesting.

### BUGS SUMMARY
1. The code incorrectly identifies the end tags using the `>` character.
2. The code does not handle self-closing tags properly.

### SUGGESTED FIX
To fix the issues, the following changes can be made to the code:

1. Modify the condition to check for the end tag. Update the `elif` condition from `char == ">"` to `char == "/" and prev_char == "<"`.
2. Add a check for self-closing tags. Update the `if` condition to check for self-closing tags using the `"/"` character.

By making these changes, the code will correctly identify start tags, end tags, and self-closing tags, and calculate the maximum level of nesting accurately.
