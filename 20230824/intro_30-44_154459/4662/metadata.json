Issue: The code is not correctly identifying the start and end tags.\n   - Bug: The code checks for the character `<` to identify the start tag, which is correct. However, it checks for the character `>` to identify the end tag, which is incorrect. In XML, the end tag is identified by `</`.\n   - Impact: This bug results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum level of nesting.\n\n2. Issue: The code does not handle self-closing tags properly.\n   - Bug: The code only increments the `current_level` variable when it encounters a start tag, and decrements it when it encounters an end tag. However, it does not handle self-closing tags, which should not change the current level.\n   - Impact: This bug results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum level of nesting.\n\n### BUGS SUMMARY\n1. The code incorrectly identifies the end tags using the `>` character.\n2. The code does not handle self-closing tags properly.\n\n### SUGGESTED FIX\nTo fix the issues, the following changes can be made to the code:\n\n1. Modify the condition to check for the end tag. Update the `elif` condition from `char == \">\"` to `char == \"/\" and prev_char == \"<\"`.\n2. Add a check for self-closing tags. Update the `if` condition to check for self-closing tags using the `\"/\"` character.\n\nBy making these changes, the code will correctly identify start tags, end tags, and self-closing tags, and calculate the maximum level of nesting accurately.",
