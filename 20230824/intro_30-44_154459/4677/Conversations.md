I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Sig has built his own keyboard. Designed for ultimate simplicity, this keyboard only has 3 keys on it: the 0 key, the 1 key and the backspace key.
To begin with, he is using a plain text editor with this keyboard. This editor always displays one string (possibly empty). Just after the editor is launched, this string is empty. When each key on the keyboard is pressed, the following changes occur to the string:
 - The 0 key: a letter 0 will be inserted to the right of the string.
 - The 1 key: a letter 1 will be inserted to the right of the string.
 - The backspace key: if the string is empty, nothing happens. Otherwise, the rightmost letter of the string is deleted.
Sig has launched the editor, and pressed these keys several times. You are given a string s, which is a record of his keystrokes in order. In this string, the letter 0 stands for the 0 key, the letter 1 stands for the 1 key and the letter B stands for the backspace key. What string is displayed in the editor now?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≦ |s| ≦ 10 (|s| denotes the length of s)
 - s consists of the letters 0, 1 and B.
 - The correct answer is not an empty string.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s

-----Output-----
Print the string displayed in the editor in the end.

-----Sample Input-----
01B0

-----Sample Output-----
00

Each time the key is pressed, the string in the editor will change as follows: 0, 01, 0, 00.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
