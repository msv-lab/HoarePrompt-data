I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There are $n$ shovels in the nearby shop. The $i$-th shovel costs $a_i$ bourles.

Misha has to buy exactly $k$ shovels. Each shovel can be bought no more than once.

Misha can buy shovels by several purchases. During one purchase he can choose any subset of remaining (non-bought) shovels and buy this subset.

There are also $m$ special offers in the shop. The $j$-th of them is given as a pair $(x_j, y_j)$, and it means that if Misha buys exactly $x_j$ shovels during one purchase then $y_j$ most cheapest of them are for free (i.e. he will not pay for $y_j$ most cheapest shovels during the current purchase).

Misha can use any offer any (possibly, zero) number of times, but he cannot use more than one offer during one purchase (but he can buy shovels without using any offers).

Your task is to calculate the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels, if Misha buys them optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le min(n, 2000)$) — the number of shovels in the shop, the number of special offers and the number of shovels Misha has to buy, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the cost of the $i$-th shovel.

The next $m$ lines contain special offers. The $j$-th of them is given as a pair of integers $(x_i, y_i)$ ($1 \le y_i \le x_i \le n$) and means that if Misha buys exactly $x_i$ shovels during some purchase, then he can take $y_i$ most cheapest of them for free.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum cost of buying $k$ shovels if Misha buys them optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 4 5
2 5 4 2 6 3 1
2 1
6 5
2 1
3 1

Output
7

Input
9 4 8
6 8 5 1 8 1 1 2 1

8 4
5 3
9 7

Output
17

Input
5 1 4
2 5 7 4 6
5 4

Output
17



-----Note-----

In the first example Misha can buy shovels on positions $1$ and $4$ (both with costs $2$) during the first purchase and get one of them for free using the first or the third special offer. And then he can buy shovels on positions $3$ and $6$ (with costs $4$ and $3$) during the second purchase and get the second one for free using the first or the third special offer. Then he can buy the shovel on a position $7$ with cost $1$. So the total cost is $4 + 2 + 1 = 7$.

In the second example Misha can buy shovels on positions $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $8$ (costs are $6$, $8$, $5$, $1$ and $2$) and get three cheapest (with costs $5$, $1$ and $2$) for free. And then he can buy shovels on positions $6$, $7$ and $9$ (all with costs $1$) without using any special offers. So the total cost is $6 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17$.

In the third example Misha can buy four cheapest shovels without using any special offers and get the total cost $17$.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

Looking at the provided code, we can identify the following bugs:

1. Incorrect calculation of the remaining shovels to be bought after using special offers.
2. Incorrect slicing of the shovel costs to calculate the cost for each special offer.
3. Incorrect calculation of the total cost for the remaining shovels.

Let's go through each bug in detail and explain how it affects the functionality of the program.

##### Bug 1: Incorrect calculation of the remaining shovels to be bought after using special offers.

In the provided code, the calculation of the remaining shovels to be bought after using special offers is incorrect. It uses the variable `k` as the stop index for slicing the shovel costs, which is incorrect. The correct stop index should be `num_bought + num_to_buy`.

Impact: This bug causes the program to consider more shovels than required when calculating the cost for the remaining shovels. As a result, the total cost is higher than the expected minimum cost.

##### Bug 2: Incorrect slicing of the shovel costs to calculate the cost for each special offer.

In the code, the slicing of the shovel costs to calculate the cost for each special offer is incorrect. It uses the variable `num_bought` as the start index and `num_bought + num_to_buy - num_free` as the stop index, which is incorrect. The correct start index should be `num_bought + num_free`.

Impact: This bug causes the program to include more shovels in the cost calculation for special offers than necessary. As a result, the total cost is higher than the expected minimum cost.

##### Bug 3: Incorrect calculation of the total cost for the remaining shovels.

In the code, the calculation of the total cost for the remaining shovels is incorrect. It uses the slicing `shovel_costs[num_bought:num_bought + k]` to calculate the cost, which is incorrect. The correct slicing should be `shovel_costs[num_bought:]`.

Impact: This bug causes the program to include more shovels in the cost calculation for the remaining shovels than required. As a result, the total cost is higher than the expected minimum cost.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

To fix the bugs in the provided code, we can make the following improvements:

1. Update the calculation of the remaining shovels to be bought after using special offers by changing the stop index from `k` to `num_bought + num_to_buy`.
2. Update the slicing of the shovel costs for calculating the cost for each special offer by changing the start index from `num_bought` to `num_bought + num_free`.
3. Update the calculation of the total cost for the remaining shovels by changing the slicing from `shovel_costs[num_bought:num_bought + k]` to `shovel_costs[num_bought:]`.

With these improvements, the code should be able to correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying `k` shovels.

Please note that the provided code does not handle the case where the number of remaining shovels after using special offers (`n - num_bought`) is less than `k`. This means that the code may access indices beyond the length of the `shovel_costs` list and result in an `IndexError`. To handle this case, we need to add a condition to check if `n - num_bought` is less than `k` and adjust the slicing accordingly.

Additionally, the code is missing input validation and error handling. It assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect. It is good practice to add input validation and error handling to ensure the program can handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
