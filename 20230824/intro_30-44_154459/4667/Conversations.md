I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

There are a few bugs in the provided code:

1. Incorrect way of reading input: The code assumes that the first line of input contains the number of lines in the XML document. However, in the given example input, the first line contains the number of lines. The correct way to read the input is to split the first line into two parts - using the first part as the number of lines and the second part as the XML document itself.

2. Incomplete implementation of `get_element_score` function: The function `get_element_score` is intended to calculate the score of an XML element by counting the number of attributes it has. While the function correctly calculates the score for attributes of the root element, it does not consider the attributes of child elements. This is because the function only iterates over the child elements of the input element and does not take into account the attributes of those child elements.

3. Incorrect construction of XML tree: The code constructs an XML tree using `ET.fromstring(xml_string)`, which assumes that `xml_string` contains a valid XML structure. However, the given input contains a partial XML document, which does not have a root element. This will raise an `xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError` when trying to parse the XML string.

4. Incorrect printing of the score: The code prints the score on a new line, which is not the expected output format. The score should be printed on the same line without any additional characters or new lines.

Overall, the bugs in the code result in incorrect calculation of the score and incorrect output format.

### SOLUTION

Considering the feedback, the bugs in the code can be fixed as follows:

1. Correct way of reading input: Split the first line of input into two parts - using the first part as the number of lines (N) and the second part as the XML document itself.

2. Complete implementation of `get_element_score` function: Modify the `get_element_score` function to include counting the attributes of child elements as well. To do this, iterate over both the attributes and child elements of the input element and add the count of attributes to the score. Additionally, recursively call the `get_element_score` function for each child element and add its score to the total score.

3. Fix construction of XML tree: To handle the given partial XML document without a root element, wrap the XML document in a root element. This can be done by adding a string "<root>" before the XML string and "</root>" after the XML string. Then, construct the XML tree using `ET.fromstring(xml_string)`.

4. Print the score without additional characters or new lines: Remove the newline character at the end of the print statement to print the score on the same line without any additional characters or new lines.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def get_element_score(element):
    score = len(element.attrib)
    for child in element:
        score += get_element_score(child)
        score += len(child.attrib)
    return score

# Read input
N, xml = input().split(maxsplit=1)

# Add root element to the XML string
xml_string = "<root>\n" + xml + "\n</root>"

# Construct XML tree
root = ET.fromstring(xml_string)

# Calculate score
score = get_element_score(root)

# Print score
print(score, end="")
```

This code takes the first line of input and splits it into two parts using `input().split(maxsplit=1)`. The first part is assigned to `N`, representing the number of lines. The second part is assigned to `xml`, representing the XML document itself.

The XML string is then constructed by adding "<root>" before the XML string and "</root>" after the XML string. The XML tree is constructed using `ET.fromstring(xml_string)`.

The `get_element_score` function is modified to also count the attributes of child elements. This is done by iterating over both the attributes and child elements of the input element, adding the count of attributes to the score, and recursively calling the `get_element_score` function for each child element.

The score is calculated by calling `get_element_score` with the root element as the input. The score is then printed on the same line without any additional characters or new lines using `print(score, end="")`.
