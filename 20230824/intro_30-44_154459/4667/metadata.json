          "feedback": "### REVIEW\n\nThere are a few bugs in the provided code:\n\n1. Incorrect way of reading input: The code assumes that the first line of input contains the number of lines in the XML document. However, in the given example input, the first line contains the number of lines. The correct way to read the input is to split the first line into two parts - using the first part as the number of lines and the second part as the XML document itself.\n\n2. Incomplete implementation of `get_element_score` function: The function `get_element_score` is intended to calculate the score of an XML element by counting the number of attributes it has. While the function correctly calculates the score for attributes of the root element, it does not consider the attributes of child elements. This is because the function only iterates over the child elements of the input element and does not take into account the attributes of those child elements.\n\n3. Incorrect construction of XML tree: The code constructs an XML tree using `ET.fromstring(xml_string)`, which assumes that `xml_string` contains a valid XML structure. However, the given input contains a partial XML document, which does not have a root element. This will raise an `xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError` when trying to parse the XML string.\n\n4. Incorrect printing of the score: The code prints the score on a new line, which is not the expected output format. The score should be printed on the same line without any additional characters or new lines.\n\nOverall, the bugs in the code result in incorrect calculation of the score and incorrect output format.",
