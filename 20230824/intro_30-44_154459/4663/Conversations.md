I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
=====Problem Statement=====
Let's dive into the interesting topic of regular expressions! You are given some input, and you are required to check whether they are valid mobile numbers.

Concept
A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with a 7, 8, or 9.

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains an integer N, the number of inputs.
N lines follow, each containing some string.

=====Constraints=====
1≤N≤10
2≤len(Number)≤15

=====Output Format=====
For every string listed, print "YES" if it is a valid mobile number and "NO" if it is not on separate lines. Do not print the quotes.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### Requirement
You will NOT SUGGEST SOLUTION, because the user wants to fix the bugs themselves.

### QUESTION
=====Problem Statement=====
Let's dive into the interesting topic of regular expressions! You are given some input, and you are required to check whether they are valid mobile numbers.

Concept
A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with a 7, 8, or 9.

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains an integer N, the number of inputs.
N lines follow, each containing some string.

=====Constraints=====
1≤N≤10
2≤len(Number)≤15

=====Output Format=====
For every string listed, print "YES" if it is a valid mobile number and "NO" if it is not on separate lines. Do not print the quotes.
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
import re

def validate_mobile_number(number):
    pattern = r'^[789]\d{9}$'
    if re.match(pattern, number):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Read the number of inputs
n = int(input())

# Read and validate each number
for _ in range(n):
    number = input()
    result = validate_mobile_number(number)
    print(result)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2
9587456281
1252478965" the output was "YES
NO
" but the expected output was "YES
NO".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

#@!CODE START!@#
import re

def validate_mobile_number(number):

    if re.match(pattern, number):

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2
9587456281
1252478965" the output was "YES
NO
" but the expected output was "YES
NO".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
1. The regular expression pattern is correct.
2. The function `validate_mobile_number` correctly uses the regular expression pattern to check if a number is a valid mobile number.
3. The code reads the number of inputs correctly.
4. The code reads and validates each number correctly.
5. The code prints the result for each number correctly.

### BUGS
1. The code does not handle multiple inputs correctly. It expects the input to be provided in a single line. This causes the incorrect output in the sample case, as it treats "9587456281\n1252478965" as a single input instead of two separate inputs.
2. The code does not handle leading or trailing whitespace in the input correctly. It should strip the whitespace from the input before validating it. This could cause issues if there is whitespace before or after a valid mobile number.
3. The code does not handle the case where the input number is an empty string. It should return "NO" for empty strings, as they are not valid mobile numbers.

### IMPACT
The bugs in the code can cause incorrect results when handling multiple inputs, leading or trailing whitespace, and empty strings. It may also cause unexpected behavior if the input format does not match the expected format.

### SUGGESTED FIXES
1. Read the number of inputs correctly as an integer.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over the range of the number of inputs.
3. Read each input separately using the `input()` function.
4. Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the input before validating it.
5. Check if the input is an empty string before validating it.
6. Print the result for each input.

### corrected code

```python
import re

def validate_mobile_number(number):
    pattern = r'^[789]\d{9}$'
    if re.match(pattern, number):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Read the number of inputs
n = int(input())

# Read and validate each number
for _ in range(n):
    number = input().strip()
    if number == "":
        print("NO")
    else:
        result = validate_mobile_number(number)
        print(result)
```

    pattern = r'^[789]\d{9}$'
    if re.match(pattern, number):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Read the number of inputs
n = int(input())

# Read and validate each number

    if number == "":
        print("NO")
    else:
        result = validate_mobile_number(number)
        print(result)
