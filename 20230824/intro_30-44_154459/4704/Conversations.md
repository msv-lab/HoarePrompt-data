I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Snuke and Raccoon have a heap of N cards. The i-th card from the top has the integer a_i written on it.
They will share these cards.
First, Snuke will take some number of cards from the top of the heap, then Raccoon will take all the remaining cards.
Here, both Snuke and Raccoon have to take at least one card.
Let the sum of the integers on Snuke's cards and Raccoon's cards be x and y, respectively.
They would like to minimize |x-y|.
Find the minimum possible value of |x-y|.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - -10^{9} \leq a_i \leq 10^{9}
 - a_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

-----Sample Output-----
1

If Snuke takes four cards from the top, and Raccoon takes the remaining two cards, x=10, y=11, and thus |x-y|=1. This is the minimum possible value.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#

" the output was "9
" but the expected output was "1

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED
1. The code does not handle the case where the number of cards is less than 2.
2. The code does not handle the case where all the cards have the same value.
3. The code does not correctly calculate the sum of Snuke's cards.
4. The code does not correctly calculate the sum of Raccoon's cards.
5. The code does not account for the fact that Raccoon must take all the remaining cards.

To fix the bugs in the code, we need to address each of the identified issues:

1. The code does not handle the case where the number of cards is less than 2.
    - We can add a check at the beginning of the code to handle this case. If the number of cards is less than 2, we can simply print 0 as there will be no difference between the sums.

2. The code does not handle the case where all the cards have the same value.
    - We need to check if all the cards have the same value before calculating the difference. If they do, the minimum possible difference will be 0.

3. The code does not correctly calculate the sum of Snuke's cards.
    - Currently, the code calculates the sum of all the cards except the last one (snuke_sum = sum(cards[:-1])). However, this includes cards that Raccoon will take. We need to calculate the sum of the cards that Snuke takes, which is the sum of the first N-1 cards.

4. The code does not correctly calculate the sum of Raccoon's cards.
    - The code currently assumes that Raccoon will take the last card (raccoon_sum = cards[-1]). However, Raccoon must take all the remaining cards, not just the last one. We need to calculate the sum of all the cards and subtract the sum of Snuke's cards to get the sum of Raccoon's cards.

5. The code does not account for the fact that Raccoon must take all the remaining cards.
    - To fix this, we can calculate the minimum possible difference by iterating over all possible choices of the number of cards Snuke takes (from 1 to N-1). For each choice, we calculate the sum of Snuke's cards and subtract it from the sum of all the cards to get the sum of Raccoon's cards. We then update the minimum difference if necessary.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Read the value of N and the list of cards
N = int(input())
cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Check if the number of cards is less than 2
if N < 2:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Check if all the cards have the same value
if len(set(cards)) == 1:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Sort the cards in ascending order
cards.sort()

# Initialize the minimum difference to a large value
min_diff = float('inf')

# Iterate over all possible choices of the number of cards Snuke takes
for i in range(1, N):
    snuke_sum = sum(cards[:i])
    raccoon_sum = sum(cards[i:])
    diff = abs(snuke_sum - raccoon_sum)
    min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)

# Print the minimum possible difference
print(min_diff)
```

Now, the code should correctly calculate the minimum possible difference between the sums of Snuke's and Raccoon's cards and provide the expected output.
