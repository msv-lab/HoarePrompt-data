I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Chef loves cooking. Also, he is very hygienic. Hence, Chef grows his own vegetables in his mini kitchen garden. He has $M$ lanes in which he grows vegetables. The $ith$  lane has $Ai$ vegetables growing in it.

Vegetables in $ith$ lane become edible on day $Di$ and day $Di+1$(that is, the vegetables are edible only on days $Di$ and $Di+1$,where $Di+1$ is the next day of $Di$).   For Example, if $Di$ is 2, then vegetable is edible on day 2 and day 3 only.   If not collected in these days, they cannot be cooked.

Also, Chef is a lone worker. Hence, with respect to his capacity, he can collect only $V$ vegetables per day.
But, Chef is a hard worker, and is willing to work every day, starting from day 1.

Chef is busy sowing the seeds. So, he assigns you the task to find out the maximum number of vegetables he can collect, provided that he collects optimally.

-----Input:-----
- First line contains of 2 space separated integers $M$ and $V$, number of lanes and capacity of Chef.
- Next $M$ lines follow
- Each $ith$ line contains 2 space separated integers, $Di$ and $Ai$, the day when the vegetable of the $ith$ lane become edible and the number of vegetables in that lane.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single integer, that is the maximum number of vegetables that can be cooked

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq M,V \leq 3000$
- $1 \leq Di,Ai \leq 3000$

-----Subtasks-----
- 20 points : $1 \leq M \leq 100$

11

-----Sample Input 2:-----
3 3
1 4
6 2
5 3

-----Sample Output 2:-----

-----EXPLANATION:-----
In the first sample, in order to obtain the optimal answer, you should do the following:-
- On day 1, collect 4 vegetables from lane 1
- On day 2, collect 2 vegetables from lane 1 and 2 vegetables from lane 2
- On day 3, collect 3 vegetables from lane 2
In the first sample, in order to obtain the optimal answer, you should do the following:-
- On day 1, collect 3 vegetables from lane 1
- On day 2, collect 1 vegetable from lane 1
- On day 5, collect 3 vegetables from lane 3
- On day 6, collect 2 vegetables from lane 2
### Requirements

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "['2 4', '1 6', '2 5']" the output was "4
" but the expected output was "['11']".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW:
The given code seems to have some logical errors. Let's analyze the code and identify the bugs:

#### 1. Error in reading the input:
The code reads the input as a single string and splits it based on white space. This will result in an incorrect input parsing. Instead, we should parse the input as follows:

```python
M, V = map(int, input().split())
lanes = []
for _ in range(M):
    D, A = map(int, input().split())
    lanes.append((D, A))
```

#### 2. Error in sorting the lanes:
The code sorts the lanes in descending order based on the day of edibility. However, this is not a correct approach as we need to consider the order in which the vegetables become edible. Sorting the lanes will change the order and give incorrect results. We should not sort the lanes.

#### 3. Error in calculating the days when vegetables are collected:
The code calculates the days when the vegetables are collected by iterating over the `A` value of each lane. However, this is incorrect. We should iterate over the range of days from `D - A + 1` to `D`, as the vegetables become edible on these days. We need to update this part of the code as follows:

```python
days = set()
for D, A in lanes:
    for i in range(D - A + 1, D + 1):
        days.add(i)
```

#### 4. Error in counting the number of vegetables collected:
The code uses a variable `ans` to keep track of the number of vegetables collected. However, there is an error in the calculation of the number of vegetables collected in each day. The line `ans += min(V, V - ans)` should actually be `ans += min(V, len(days) - ans)`, as we can collect at most `V` vegetables per day and there are `len(days)` total number of vegetables.

#### 5. Error in decrementing the daily capacity:
The code uses the line `V -= min(V, V - ans)` to decrement the daily capacity. However, this is incorrect. We should decrement the daily capacity by `min(V, len(days) - ans)`, not `min(V, V - ans)`.

#### 6. Error in printing the final answer:
The code prints the variable `ans` as the final answer. However, this is incorrect. We need to print the length of the `days` set, which represents the maximum number of vegetables that can be collected.

```python
print(len(days))
```

Overall, the code has several logical errors that need to be fixed in order to obtain the correct result.

I apologize for the confusion. I have fixed the issues in the code. Here's the corrected code:

```python
M, V = map(int, input().split())
lanes = []
for _ in range(M):
    D, A = map(int, input().split())
    lanes.append((D, A))

# Sorting the lanes in descending order is not required

days = set()
for D, A in lanes:
    for i in range(D - A + 1, D + 1):
        days.add(i)

ans = 0
for day in sorted(days):
    if V == 0:
        break
    ans += min(V, len(days) - ans)  # Fixing the calculation of the number of vegetables collected
    V -= min(V, len(days) - ans)  # Fixing the decrement of the daily capacity

print(len(days))  # Fixing the printing of the final answer
```

Please give it a try and let me know if you have any further questions.
