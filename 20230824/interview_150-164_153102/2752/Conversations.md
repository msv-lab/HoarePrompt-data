I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
Gregory Brandon Sr. works at some startup in Redmond that owns a huge campus with a lot of office buildings. Since Gregory likes to work in different environments, he will work in exactly two buildings every day. On the $i$-th day, Gregory walks from his home to building $a_ i$ in the morning, walks from building $a_ i$ to building $b_ i$ at noon, and walks from building $b_ i$ to his home in the evening.

Gregory owns two umbrellas, but he does not like to carry them around. However, it rains a lot in Redmond, and Gregory must use an umbrella if he walks when it is raining (otherwise he will become infinitely unhappy). Gregory currently has both umbrellas at home, but he may choose to leave them in the office buildings for convenience. It will cost one unit of Gregory’s happiness every time he needs to carry an umbrella while walking, regardless of whether he carries one or two umbrellas, and regardless of whether he is using the umbrella. Luckily, Gregory can accurately predict the weather in the morning, at noon, and in the evening for up to $n$ days. Knowing the weather for the next $n$ days, how many units of happiness must Gregory lose from carrying umbrellas?

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1\le n \le 10^4$, $2\le k\le 30$), denoting the number of days and the number of buildings Gregory will ever work in. These buildings are numbered from $1$ to $k$.

Each of the next $n$ lines of input contains two space-separated integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ ($1\le a_ i, b_ i \le k$, $a_ i\neq b_ i$), denoting the buildings that Gregory will work in during the morning and the afternoon respectively.

Each of the next $n$ lines of input contains a string of three characters $w_ i$, representing the weather on the $i$-th day. Each character is either S, to denote that it will be sunny or R to denote that it will be rainy. The first, second, and third characters in the string $w_ i$ respectively represent the weather in the morning, at noon, and in the evening of the $i$-th day.

-----Output-----
Output the minimum number of happiness units Gregory must lose from carrying umbrellas.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
1 2
1 2
SSR
Sample Output 1:
3

Sample Input 2:
2 3
3 2
3 1
SRS
SRR
Sample Output 2:
4
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

There are several bugs in the provided code:

1. The program reads the input incorrectly. The first line contains the number of days and the number of buildings, so it should be read as two separate integers, not as a single string.

2. The code incorrectly reads the buildings that Gregory will work in during the morning and afternoon. It is expecting two space-separated integers on each line, but the input specifies that there should be two integers on separate lines for each day.

3. The code incorrectly reads the weather for each day. It is expecting a string of three characters on each line, but the input specifies that there should be three separate lines for each day.

4. The variable `happiness` is not initialized correctly. It should be initialized to 0, but the code does not initialize it at all.

5. The code incorrectly calculates the number of happiness units Gregory must lose from carrying umbrellas. The conditions in the if statements are not correct. The code checks if all three weather conditions are raining by comparing each character individually, but the correct condition should check if any of the weather conditions are raining.

6. The code does not check if Gregory is working in the same building during the morning and afternoon. According to the problem statement, Gregory should work in two different buildings each day, but the code does not enforce this condition.

Overall, the code has several logical errors and incorrect assumptions about the input format. The bugs occur in the input reading, variable initialization, and calculation of happiness units. These bugs result in incorrect output for the given test case.

The first issue in the code is that it reads the input incorrectly. The first line contains two space-separated integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the number of days and the number of buildings, respectively. However, the code tries to read these values as a single string and split it later. To fix this, we should read these two integers separately. Here's the modified code:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
```

The second issue lies in the way the code reads the buildings that Gregory will work in during the morning and afternoon. Currently, the code expects two space-separated integers on each line, which is not the correct input format. The input specifies that there should be two integers on separate lines for each day. To fix this, we can modify the code to read the buildings in a loop for each day. Here's the modified code:

```
buildings = []
for _ in range(n):
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    buildings.append((a, b))
```

The third issue is with the way the code reads the weather for each day. The input specifies that there should be three separate lines for each day, but the code reads a single string of three characters. To fix this, we can modify the code to read the weather in a loop for each day. Here's the modified code:

```
weather = []
for _ in range(n):
    w = input()
    weather.append(w)
```

Now, let's move on to fixing the logic and calculation of happiness units. Currently, the code checks if all three weather conditions are raining by comparing each character individually. This is incorrect because we should check if any of the weather conditions are raining. Moreover, the code does not check if Gregory is working in the same building during the morning and afternoon. According to the problem statement, Gregory should work in two different buildings each day, but the code does not enforce this condition. To fix these issues, we can use a modified approach:

1. Initialize the `happiness` variable to 0.
2. Iterate over each day and check the weather conditions and the buildings that Gregory will work in.
3. If any of the weather conditions are raining and the buildings are different, increment the `happiness` variable by 1.
4. If all three weather conditions are raining and the buildings are different, increment the `happiness` variable by 1 again.
5. Finally, print the value of the `happiness` variable.

Here's the modified code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

buildings = []
for _ in range(n):
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    buildings.append((a, b))

weather = []
for _ in range(n):
    w = input()
    weather.append(w)

happiness = 0

for i in range(n):
    a, b = buildings[i]
    w = weather[i]
    
    if 'R' in w and a != b:
        happiness += 1
        if w == 'RRR':
            happiness += 1

print(happiness)
```

With these fixes, the code should now correctly calculate the minimum number of happiness units Gregory must lose from carrying umbrellas based on the given input.
