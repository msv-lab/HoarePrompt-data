I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
A daily train consists of N cars. Let's consider one particular car. It has 54 places numbered consecutively from 1 to 54, some of which are already booked and some are still free. The places are numbered in the following fashion:

The car is separated into 9 compartments of 6 places each, as shown in the picture. So, the 1st compartment consists of places 1, 2, 3, 4, 53 and 54, the 2nd compartment consists of places 5, 6, 7, 8, 51 and 52, and so on.

A group of X friends wants to buy tickets for free places, all of which are in one compartment (it's much funnier to travel together). You are given the information about free and booked places in each of the N cars. Find the number of ways to sell the friends exactly X tickets in one compartment (note that the order in which the tickets are sold doesn't matter).

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains two integers X and N (1 ≤ X ≤ 6, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10) separated by a single space. Each of the following N lines contains the information about one car which is a string of length 54 consisting of '0' and '1'. The i-th character (numbered from 1) is '0' if place i in the corresponding car is free, and is '1' if place i is already booked.

-----Output-----
Output just one integer -- the requested number of ways.

-----Example-----
Input:
1 3
100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101

011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010

Output:
85

011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010

Output:

Input:
3 2
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Output:
360

Explanation:
In the first test case, any of the free places can be sold. In the second test case, the only free compartment in the train is compartment 3 in the first car (places 9, 10, 11, 12, 49 and 50 are all free). In the third test case, the train is still absolutely free; as there are 20 ways to sell 3 tickets in an empty compartment, the answer is 2 * 9 * 20 = 360.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

IndexError: string index out of range
" but the expected output was "['85']".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED:
- The index out of range error occurs because the loop for iterating over each compartment in the car should only go up to 45, not 54. This is because the last two places in each compartment, i+45 and i+46, should be checked separately.
- The condition for checking if all places in the compartment are free is incorrect. The condition should be checking if the places are not equal to '1', not equal to '0'. This is because '0' represents a free place and '1' represents a booked place.
- The calculation of compartment_count * X should be multiplied by the number of cars, N, to get the total number of ways to sell X tickets in all cars, not just one car.

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS:
- The index out of range error causes the program to terminate with an error, preventing it from giving any output.
- The incorrect condition for checking if all places in the compartment are free results in incorrect calculations of the number of ways to sell X tickets in each car.
- The incorrect calculation of compartment_count * X results in an incorrect total number of ways to sell X tickets in all cars.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Update the loop for iterating over each compartment in the car to go up to 45 instead of 54.
- Update the condition for checking if all places in the compartment are free to check if the places are not equal to '1' instead of '0'.
- Multiply the compartment_count * X by N to get the total number of ways to sell X tickets in all cars.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
```python
def calculate_ways(X, N, cars):
    # Initialize count of ways to 0
    ways = 0
    # Iterate over each car
