I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence with N integers: A = \{ A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N \}.
For each of these N integers, we will choose a color and paint the integer with that color. Here the following condition must be satisfied:
 - If A_i and A_j (i < j) are painted with the same color, A_i < A_j.
Find the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1
:
A_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
5
2
1
4
5
3

-----Sample Output-----
2

We can satisfy the condition with two colors by, for example, painting 2 and 3 red and painting 1, 4, and 5 blue.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

        min_color = float('inf')

                min_color = min(min_color, color)
        # If no color is greater than the current number, add a new color
        if min_color == float('inf'):
            colors.append(num)
        # If a color is greater than the current number, replace it with the current number
        else:
            colors[i] = num
    return len(colors)
    
N = int(input())
A = []
for _ in range(N):
    A.append(int(input()))

result = min_colors(N, A)
print(result)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5
2

5

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5
2
1
4
5
3
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS FOUND
1. The logic for finding the minimum color that is still greater than the current number is incorrect. The code is iterating over all the colors and checking if they are greater than or equal to the current number. However, it should find the minimum color that is strictly greater than the current number.

2. The variable 'i' within the inner loop is not initialized outside the loop. As a result, if a color is greater than the current number, the code tries to replace it with the current number using 'colors[i]', but 'i' is not defined.

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS

1. The incorrect logic for finding the minimum color results in incorrect color assignments. This means that the condition "If A_i and A_j (i < j) are painted with the same color, A_i < A_j" is violated.

2. The uninitialized variable 'i' makes the code throw an error, causing a runtime exception and terminating the program.

### SUGGESTED FIXES

1. To fix the logic for finding the minimum color, initialize 'min_color' with positive infinity and keep track of the minimum color that is strictly greater than the current number.

2. Initialize 'i' before the inner loop to avoid the runtime exception. Set it to -1 initially to indicate that no color is found greater than the current number.

The code snippet you have provided contains bugs that need to be fixed. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def min_colors(N, A):
    colors = []
    for num in A:
        # Find the minimum color that is still greater than the current number
        min_color = float('inf')
        i = -1
        for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
            if color > num:
                if color < min_color:
                    min_color = color
                    i = idx
        # If no color is greater than the current number, add a new color
        if min_color == float('inf'):
            colors.append(num)
        # If a color is greater than the current number, replace it with the current number
        else:
            colors[i] = num
    return len(colors)
    
N = int(input())
A = []
for _ in range(N):
    A.append(int(input()))

result = min_colors(N, A)
print(result)
```
Now the code should work correctly and return the expected output for the given sample input.
