I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3 3

" the output was "15
" but the expected output was "60
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code provided attempts to calculate the area for all possible rectangles formed by the given lines. It does this by first finding the differences between consecutive x coordinates and y coordinates, then calculating the cumulative sum of these differences to determine the widths and heights of each rectangle. Finally, the code calculates the total area by multiplying the sum of the widths by the sum of the heights and prints the result modulo 10^9+7.

Unfortunately, there are several bugs in the code that lead to incorrect results. Let's go through the code and identify the bugs and their impacts.

### Bugs
1. **Bug: Incorrect calculation of x_diff and y_diff:** The code incorrectly calculates the differences between consecutive x coordinates and y coordinates. It uses `x[i+1] - x[i]` and `y[i+1] - y[i]` as the differences, respectively. However, this will lead to incorrect results because the number of x coordinates and y coordinates is `n` and `m` respectively, not `n-1` and `m-1`. As a result, the calculated `x_diff` will have length `n-1` and `y_diff` will have length `m-1`. This bug has a significant impact on the functionality as it leads to incorrect width and height calculations for each rectangle.

2. **Bug: Incorrect calculation of total_area:** The code correctly calculates the sum of the widths and heights using `sum(x_diff)` and `sum(y_diff)`. However, it multiplies these sums to calculate the total area. This is incorrect because the goal is to find the area of each rectangle, not the sum of the widths and heights. The correct calculation should be the sum of the products of each width and height combination. As a result, the calculated `total_area` will not correspond to the actual total area of all rectangles.

### Impact
These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The incorrect calculation of `x_diff` and `y_diff` leads to incorrect widths and heights for each rectangle, which in turn leads to incorrect calculations of the total area. As a result, the calculated `total_area` will not correspond to the actual total area of all rectangles, leading to incorrect output.

### Suggestions
To fix the bugs and improve the functionality of the code, the following suggestions can be considered:

1. Update the calculation of `x_diff` and `y_diff` to correctly consider the number of x coordinates and y coordinates. Instead of using `x[i+1] - x[i]` and `y[i+1] - y[i]`, calculate the differences using `x[i+1] - x[i]` and `y[i+1] - y[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-2` and `m-2` respectively.
2. Update the calculation of `total_area` to correctly calculate the area of each rectangle. Instead of multiplying the sums of the widths and heights, calculate the sum of the products of each width and height combination. Iterate over each value in `x_diff` and `y_diff` and calculate the product with all values in the other list, then sum these products to calculate the total area.

By addressing these bugs and implementing the suggestions, the program will be able to correctly calculate the total area of all rectangles formed by the given lines.
