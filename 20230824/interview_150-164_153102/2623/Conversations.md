I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Phoenix has a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. He wants to distribute all the letters of his string into $k$ non-empty strings $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ such that every letter of $s$ goes to exactly one of the strings $a_i$. The strings $a_i$ do not need to be substrings of $s$. Phoenix can distribute letters of $s$ and rearrange the letters within each string $a_i$ however he wants.

For example, if $s = $ baba and $k=2$, Phoenix may distribute the letters of his string in many ways, such as:   ba and ba  a and abb  ab and ab  aa and bb 

But these ways are invalid:   baa and ba  b and ba  baba and empty string ($a_i$ should be non-empty) 

Phoenix wants to distribute the letters of his string $s$ into $k$ strings $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ to minimize the lexicographically maximum string among them, i. e. minimize $max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$. Help him find the optimal distribution and print the minimal possible value of $max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$.

String $x$ is lexicographically less than string $y$ if either $x$ is a prefix of $y$ and $x \ne y$, or there exists an index $i$ ($1 \le i \le min(|x|, |y|))$ such that $x_i$ < $y_i$ and for every $j$ $(1 \le j < i)$ $x_j = y_j$. Here $|x|$ denotes the length of the string $x$.


-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of each test case consists of two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of string $s$ and the number of non-empty strings, into which Phoenix wants to distribute letters of $s$, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases is $\le 10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ answers — one per test case. The $i$-th answer should be the minimal possible value of $max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$ in the $i$-th test case.


-----Example-----
Input
6
4 2
baba
5 2
baacb
5 3
baacb
5 3
aaaaa
6 4
aaxxzz
7 1
phoenix

Output
ab
abbc
b
aa
x
ehinopx



-----Note-----

In the first test case, one optimal solution is to distribute baba into ab and ab. 

In the second test case, one optimal solution is to distribute baacb into abbc and a.

In the third test case, one optimal solution is to distribute baacb into ac, ab, and b.

In the fourth test case, one optimal solution is to distribute aaaaa into aa, aa, and a.

In the fifth test case, one optimal solution is to distribute aaxxzz into az, az, x, and x.

In the sixth test case, one optimal solution is to distribute phoenix into ehinopx.
### Requirements

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code above is attempting to solve the problem by distributing the letters of the input string into `k` non-empty strings. However, there are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect results.

#### Bug 1: Sorting the letters of `s`
The first bug is in the line `letters = sorted(list(s))`. This line is attempting to sort the letters of string `s` in ascending order. However, the problem statement does not mention any requirement to sort the letters. The code should distribute the letters into `k` strings without any specific order. Removing this line will fix the bug.

#### Bug 2: Creating `k` empty strings
The second bug is in the line `strings = [''] * k`. This line is creating a list of `k` empty strings. However, the problem statement does not specify that the strings should be empty initially. The code should distribute the letters into `k` strings without any specific initialization. Removing this line will fix the bug.

#### Bug 3: Distributing letters into strings
The third bug is in the loop `for i in range(len(letters))`. This loop is incorrectly distributing the letters into the strings. It uses the modulo operator to determine which string to append the current letter to. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal distribution. In some cases, the lexicographically maximum string among the strings could be larger than necessary. The code should distribute the letters in a different way to ensure the minimal possible value of `max(a1, a2, ..., ak)`. The current implementation does not correctly handle this requirement and needs to be fixed.

#### Bug 4: Returning the minimal possible value
The fourth bug is in the line `return min(strings)`. This line is attempting to return the minimal possible value of `max(a1, a2, ..., ak)`. However, the `min` function is comparing the strings lexicographically, which is incorrect. The code should find a different way to determine the minimal possible value of `max(a1, a2, ..., ak)`. The current implementation does not correctly handle this requirement and needs to be fixed.

### BUG SUMMARY

- Bug 1: Sorting the letters of `s` (Not needed)
- Bug 2: Creating `k` empty strings (Not needed)
- Bug 3: Incorrectly distributing letters into strings
- Bug 4: Incorrectly returning the minimal possible value of `max(a1, a2, ..., ak)`

### IMPACT

These bugs have a significant impact on the program's functionality. The incorrect distribution of letters can result in larger than necessary lexicographically maximum strings, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, returning the wrong minimal possible value can also lead to incorrect output. Therefore, all the bugs identified need to be fixed to get the correct result.
