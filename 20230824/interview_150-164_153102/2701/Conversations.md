I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
In Chef's house there are N apples lying in a row on the floor. These apples are numbered from 1 (left most one) to N (right most one). The types of apples are also numbered by positive integers, and the type of apple i is Ti.
Chef has recently brought two trained dogs. Both of the dogs are too intelligent to know the smell of each type of apple. If Chef gives a dog an integer x, and releases it at one end of the row of apples, then the dog smells each apple one by one. Once the dog find an apple of type x, the dog picks the apple and back to Chef's room immidiately. If there is no apple of type x, then the dog will back without any apples.
Now Chef wants to eat two apples as soon as possible. Here the apples must have distinct types, and the sum of the types must be equal to K. Chef can release the dogs from either of the ends, namely, he can leave (both at left end) or (both at right end) or (one at left end and one at right end) and he can release them at the same time. The dogs take one second to smell each apple. However the dogs can run rapidly, so the time for moving can be ignored. What is the minimum time (in seconds) to get the desired apples from his dogs?

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the number of apples and the required sum respectively. Then the next line contains N space-separated integers T1, T2, ..., TN, denoting the types of the apples.

-----Output-----
Print one integer describing the minimum number of seconds that Chef needs to wait till he gets the desired apples. If Chef cannot get the desired apples, then output "-1" without quotes.

-----Constraints-----
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 500000 (5 × 105)
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000000 (106)
- 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000000 (106)

-----Example-----
Sample Input 1:
5 5
2 4 3 2 1

Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Input 2:
5 5
2 4 9 2 5

Sample Output 2:
-1

-----Explanation-----
In the first example, if Chef leaves the first dog from left and gives it integer 4, and the second dog from right and gives it integer 1, then the first dog takes 2 seconds and the second dog takes 1 second to get the apples. Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds. In any other way, Chef can't get the desired apples in less than 2 seconds.
In the second example, Chef cannot get two apples such that the sum of their types is 5 so the answer is "-1".
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "['5 5', '2 4 3 2 1']" the output was "4
" but the expected output was "['2']".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED
1. The code is using incorrect input method. Instead of using `input` function, it should be using function parameters to get the inputs.
2. The code is not converting the input strings into integers before processing.
3. The code is not handling the case when two dogs are released from the same end.
4. The code is not handling the case when there is only one apple of each type, but their sum is equal to K.
5. The code is not considering the scenario when there are multiple apples of same type, but their sum is equal to K.

### BUGS DETAILS
**Bug 1:** The code is using incorrect input method. Instead of using `input` function, it should be using function parameters to get the inputs.
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
apples = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
**Bug 2:** The code is not converting the input strings into integers before processing.
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
apples = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
**Bug 3:** The code is not handling the case when two dogs are released from the same end.
```python
if K - t != t and K - t in types:
    return min(types[t]) + min(types[K - t]) + 2
```
**Bug 4:** The code is not handling the case when there is only one apple of each type, but their sum is equal to K.
```python
if K - t != t and K - t in types:
    return min(types[t]) + min(types[K - t]) + 2
```
**Bug 5:** The code is not considering the scenario when there are multiple apples of same type, but their sum is equal to K.
```python
if K - t != t and K - t in types:
    return min(types[t]) + min(types[K - t]) + 2
```

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS
**Bug 1:** Using incorrect input method will cause the code to raise an error.

**Bug 2:** Not converting the input strings into integers before processing will result in incorrect values being used in the code.

**Bug 3:** Not handling the case when two dogs are released from the same end will lead to incorrect result. In such scenario, the code should check for a single type of apple that is equal to half of the required sum. If such type exists, then the code should return the minimum index of that type of apple multiplied by 2.

**Bug 4:** Not handling the case when there is only one apple of each type, but their sum is equal to K will result in incorrect result. In this scenario, the code should return the minimum index of both types of apples added together.

**Bug 5:** Not considering the scenario when there are multiple apples of same type, but their sum is equal to K will result in incorrect result. In this scenario, the code should return the minimum index of the type of apple multiplied by 2.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
**Bug 1:** Update the code to use the function parameters as input sources.
**Bug 2:** Convert the input strings into integers before processing.
**Bug 3:** Handle the case when two dogs are released from the same end by checking for a single type of apple that is equal to half of the required sum.
**Bug 4:** Handle the case when there is only one apple of each type, but their sum is equal to K by returning the minimum index of both types of apples added together.
**Bug 5:** Consider the scenario when there are multiple apples of same type, but their sum is equal to K by returning the minimum index of the type of apple multiplied by 2.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS DETAILS
**Bug 1:** Update the code to use the function parameters as input sources.
```python
def minimum_time(N, K, apples):
```
**Bug 2:** Convert the input strings into integers before processing.
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
apples = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
**Bug 3:** Handle the case when two dogs are released from the same end by checking for a single type of apple that is equal to half of the required sum.
```python
if K - t != t and K - t in types:
    return min(types[t]) + min(types[K - t]) + 2
```
**Bug 4:** Handle the case when there is only one apple of each type, but their sum is equal to K by returning the minimum index of both types of apples added together.
```python
if len(types) == 2 and sum(types) == K:
    return sum(min(types.values()))  # Assuming types is a dictionary
```
**Bug 5:** Consider the scenario when there are multiple apples of same type, but their sum is equal to K by returning the minimum index of the type of apple multiplied by 2.
```python
if K % 2 == 0 and K / 2 in types:
    return 2 * min(types[K / 2])
```
