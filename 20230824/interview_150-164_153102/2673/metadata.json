If so, the previous index is added to the queue, the number of jumps for that index is updated, and it is marked as visited.\n- Similarly, a check is performed for the next index (`current+1`).\n- Lastly, a loop iterates through all indices of the sequence. If the digit at index `i` is equal to the digit at `current` and `i` has not been visited, `i` is added to the queue, the number of jumps for that index is updated, and it is marked as visited.\n- After the loop, the function ends without returning anything.\n\n#### BUGS\n1. The code does not return any value if the last index is not reachable.\n2. The code does not handle cases where the current digit itself is not added to the queue.\n\n#### IMPACT\n1. The first bug is critical as it prevents the function from correctly handling cases where the last digit is not reachable. This means that for certain inputs, the code will not return the expected minimal number of jumps and will instead return nothing.\n2. The second bug has a minor impact on the program's functionality. It means that the current digit is excluded from the possible jumps, which may result in an incorrect number of jumps required to reach the last digit.\n\nSince the code is missing a return statement, it should produce an error when executed. However, it seems to have been run outside of this notebook, which is why it appears to give a correct output even though it doesn't.",
