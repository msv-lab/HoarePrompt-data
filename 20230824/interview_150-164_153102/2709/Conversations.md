I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You think you can code?

 This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.

 You are given two integers $N$ and $t$; and then an array $A$ of $N$ integers ($0$-based indexing).

 Based on the value of $t$, you will perform an action on $A$.

$t$

Action Needed

$1$

Print $7$, regardless of the content of $A$

$2$

Print “Bigger” if $A[0] > A[1]$, or 

Print “Equal” if $A[0] == A[1]$, or 

Print “Smaller” otherwise (without the quotes); 

Ignore other indices of $A$, if any

$3$

Print the median of three integers {$A[0]$, $A[1]$, and $A[2]$}; 

Ignore other indices of $A$, if any

$4$

Print the sum of all integers in $A$

$5$

Print the sum of all even integers in $A$

$6$

Apply modulo (%) $26$ to each integer in $A$, 

Map integer $0$/$1$/$\ldots $/$25$ to character ‘a’/‘b’/$\ldots $/‘z’, 

Finally, print the sequence of characters as a string (without the spaces)

$7$

a. Start from index $i = 0$; 

b. Jump to index $i = A[i]$; 

c. If the current index $i$ is outside the valid bound of [0..$N$-1], print “Out” and stop; 

d. Else if the current index $i$ is index $N$-$1$, print “Done” and stop; 

e1. Otherwise, repeat step b; 

e2. If doing this leads to an infinite loop, print “Cyclic” and stop; 

(all output are without the quotes)

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer $N$ and $t$ ($3 \leq N \leq 200000$; $1 \leq t \leq 7$).

 The second line of the input contains $N$ non-negative $32$-bit signed integers.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of $t$.

-----Scoring-----
There are $20$ hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.

 All $20$ test cases will be tested.

 Each hidden test case worth $5$ points (the $7$ sample test cases below worth $0$ point).

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
7 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 1:
7

Sample Input 2:
7 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 2:
Smaller

Sample Input 3:
7 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 3:
2

Sample Input 4:
7 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 4:
28

Sample Input 5:
7 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 5:
12

Sample Input 6:
10 6
7 4 11 37 14 22 40 17 11 3
Sample Output 6:
helloworld
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
