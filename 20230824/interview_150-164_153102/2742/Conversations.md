I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You have recently acquired a new job at the Bank for Acquiring Peculiar Currencies. Here people can make payments, and deposit or withdraw money in all kinds of strange currencies. At your first day on the job you help a customer from Nijmegia, a small insignificant country famous for its enormous coins with values equal to powers of $10$, that is, $1, 10, 100, 1000$, etc. This customer wants to make a rather large payment, and you are not looking forward to the prospect of carrying all those coins to and from the vault.

You therefore decide to think things over first. You have an enormous supply of Nijmegian coins in reserve, as does the customer (most citizens from Nijmegia are extremely strong). You now want to minimize the total number of coins that are exchanged, in either direction, to make the exact payment the customer has to make.

For example, if the customer wants to pay $83$ coins there are many ways to make the exchange. Here are three possibilities:Option 1.

The customer pays $8$ coins of value $10$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $8 + 3 = 11$ coins.Option 2.

The customer pays a coin of value $100$, and you return a coin of value $10$, and $7$ coins of value $1$. This requires exchanging $1 + 1 + 7 = 9$ coins.Option 3.

The customer pays a coin of value $100$, and $3$ coins of value $1$. You return $2$ coins of value $10$. This requires exchanging $1 + 3 + 2 = 6$ coins.

It turns out the last way of doing it requires the least coins possible.

-----Input-----
 - A single integer $0\leq n < 10^{1000}$, the amount the customer from Nijmegia has to pay.

-----Output-----
 - Output the minimum number of coins that have to be exchanged to make the required payment.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
83
Sample Output 1:
6

Sample Input 2:
13
Sample Output 2:
4

Sample Input 3:
0
Sample Output 3:
0
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "83
" the output was "5

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are a few bugs in the code. Let's go through each bug and see how they impact the program's functionality.

Bug 1: Incorrect calculation of the number of coins at each power of 10
In the code, the number of coins at each power of 10 is calculated using the formula `coins = n % 10`. However, this is incorrect because it only considers the last digit of the payment amount. For example, if the payment amount is 83, the code calculates `coins = 83 % 10`, which results in `coins = 3`. But in reality, the payment should be divided into 8 coins of value 10 and 3 coins of value 1. This bug will cause incorrect calculations and lead to incorrect results.

Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of the number of coins less than 5
In the code, if the number of coins is less than 5, no exchange is needed and the number of coins is added to `min_coins`. However, this is incorrect because the number of coins less than 5 should not be added directly to `min_coins`. Instead, it should be checked if there are any coins of higher value (i.e. 10) that can be exchanged for coins of lower value (i.e. 1) before adding to `min_coins`. This bug will lead to incorrect calculations and incorrect results.

Bug 3: Incorrect exchange for coins of value 5
In the code, if the number of coins is equal to 5, the code exchanges 5 coins for a coin of the next power of 10. However, this is incorrect because 5 coins of value 1 can be used instead of exchanging for a coin of higher value. This bug will lead to incorrect calculations and incorrect results.

Bug 4: Incorrect exchange for coins greater than 5
In the code, if the number of coins is greater than 5, the code exchanges `10 - coins` for a coin of the next power of 10. However, this is incorrect because the correct exchange should be `coins - 5` for coins of value 1 and then exchanging 5 coins of value 1 for a coin of higher value. This bug will lead to incorrect calculations and incorrect results.

Bug 5: Incorrect increment of power of 10
In the code, the power of 10 is incorrectly incremented after each iteration of the loop using `power *= 10`. However, this is incorrect because the power of 10 should be incremented by multiplying `power` with 10. This bug will lead to incorrect calculations and incorrect results.

Now let's see how these bugs impact the program's functionality and result in incorrect outputs.

### BUGGY CODE
```
n = int(input())

min_coins = 0

power = 1
while n > 0:
    coins = n % 10
    
    if coins < 5:
        min_coins += coins
    elif coins == 5:
        min_coins += 1
    else:
        min_coins += 10 - coins
    
    n //= 10
    
    power *= 10

print(min_coins)
```

### IMPACT OF BUGS

To understand the impact of the bugs, let's take an example:

Example:
```
Input: 83
Expected output: 6
```

Execution of the buggy code:

- Loop 1:
  - n = 83, coins = 3 (Bug 1)
  - coins < 5, min_coins = 3 (Incorrect calculation - Bug 2)
  - n = 8, power = 10 (Incorrect increment - Bug 5)

- Loop 2:
  - n = 8, coins = 8 (Bug 1)
  - coins < 5, min_coins = 11 (Incorrect calculation - Bug 2)
  - n = 0, power = 100

Final min_coins = 11 (Incorrect result)

As we can see from the example, the buggy code does not give the expected output of 6. The incorrect calculation of the number of coins and the incorrect exchange logic lead to incorrect results.

Now that we have identified the bugs and their impact, the next step is to fix these bugs to achieve the correct output.

To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

Bug 1: Incorrect calculation of the number of coins at each power of 10
Instead of using `coins = n % 10`, we need to divide the payment amount by 10 to get the number of coins at each power of 10. We can do this using the floor division operator `//`. This will give us the correct number of coins at each power of 10.

Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of the number of coins less than 5
Instead of directly adding the number of coins less than 5 to `min_coins`, we need to check if there are any coins of higher value that can be exchanged for coins of lower value before adding them to `min_coins`. We can do this using a simple if condition.

Bug 3: Incorrect exchange for coins of value 5
Instead of exchanging 5 coins for a coin of higher value, we can directly add 1 to `min_coins` for each coin of value 5. This will give us the correct result.

Bug 4: Incorrect exchange for coins greater than 5
Instead of exchanging `10 - coins` for a coin of higher value, we need to exchange `coins - 5` for coins of value 1 and then exchange 5 coins of value 1 for a coin of higher value. We can do this by subtracting 5 from `coins`, adding the result to `min_coins`, and then adding 1 to `min_coins` for each remaining coin of value 1. This will give us the correct result.

Bug 5: Incorrect increment of power of 10
Instead of using `power *= 10` to increment the power of 10, we need to multiply `power` with 10. This will give us the correct result.

Now let's apply these fixes and implement the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())

min_coins = 0
power = 1

while n > 0:
    coins = n // 10  # Fix for Bug 1

    if coins < 5:  # Fix for Bug 2
        min_coins += coins
    elif coins == 5:  # Fix for Bug 3
        min_coins += 1
    else:
        min_coins += coins - 5  # Fix for Bug 4
        min_coins += coins % 5  # Fix for Bug 4

    n //= 10
    power *= 10  # Fix for Bug 5

print(min_coins)
```

With these fixes, the code should now produce the correct output.
