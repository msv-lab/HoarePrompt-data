I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Having solved the match issue, Mirko faced another challenging problem. His mom ordered him to read an article about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the “Moja Tajna” magazine. The article is written in a very small font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner in the closet which will enlarge the article for him.

The article is a matrix of characters with $R$ rows and $C$ columns. The characters are letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character ‘.’ (period). Mirko’s scanner supports two parameters, $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$. It substitutes each character it scans with a matrix of $Z_ R$ rows and $Z_ C$ columns, where all entries are equal to the scanned character.

Mirko realized his scanner’s software no longer works so he needs your help.

-----Input-----
The first row contains four integers, $R$, $C$, $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$. $R$ and $C$ are between $1$ and $50$, while $Z_ R$ and $Z_ C$ are between $1$ and $5$.

Each of the following $R$ rows contains $C$ characters each, representing the article from “Moja Tajna”.

-----Output-----
The output should be a matrix of characters with $R \cdot Z_ R$ rows and $C \cdot Z_ C$ columns, the enlarged article.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
3 3 1 2
.x.
x.x
.x.
Sample Output:
..xx..
xx..xx
..xx..
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
