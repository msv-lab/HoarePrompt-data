I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Yraglac has been a bit bored with Calgary lately and decided to move to the United States. After arriving in the strange land, he discovered that the people there use a temperature scale known as Fahrenheit. Celsius and Fahrenheit are related by the following equation:\[ \left[ ^\circ F \right] = \frac95 \left[ ^\circ C \right] + 32 \]

It is your job to help Yraglac convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. When it comes to temperatures, however, Yraglac is a bit particular. Given a temperature expressed as a fraction in Fahrenheit, he wants to know the exact value in Celsius, expressed as a fraction in lowest terms.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single test case representing a fractional number in Fahrenheit. It will be in the form $a/b$ or $-a/b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $0 \leq a, b \leq 1000000$ and $b \neq 0$. Note that the input is not guaranteed to be a fraction in lowest terms. You should consider temperatures below absolute zero to be valid.

-----Output-----
Output a single line with the exact result of converting the temperature to Celsius, expressed as a fraction in lowest terms (that is, $\gcd (a,b) = 1$).

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
32/1
Sample Output 1:
0/1

Sample Input 2:
33/1
Sample Output 2:
5/9

Sample Input 3:
-40/1
Sample Output 3:
-40/1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

# Calculate the temperature in Celsius using the given formula
celsius_numerator = (numerator - 32) * 5

def gcd(a, b):

        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

gcd_value = gcd(celsius_numerator, celsius_denominator)

# Reduce the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by the gcd
celsius_numerator //= gcd_value

# Check if the temperature is negative and adjust the sign of the numerator accordingly
if celsius_numerator < 0:
    celsius_numerator *= -1
    sign = '-'
else:
    sign = ''

# Print the result in the required format
print(sign + str(celsius_numerator) + '/' + str(celsius_denominator))

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "-84/9
" the output was "-580/9
" but the expected output was "-620/27

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "-84/9
" the output was "-580/9
" but the expected output was "-620/27
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. The input is not being read correctly. There is an extra newline character ("\n") at the end of the input. This newline character is being included in the numerator and denominator values, leading to incorrect calculations.

   **Impact:** This bug causes incorrect temperature conversion and affects the overall functionality of the program.

   **Location:** Line 4

2. The formula used to calculate the temperature in Celsius is incorrect. The numerator should be multiplied by 5 and then divided by 9, not multiplied by 5 directly. Additionally, the denominator should also be multiplied by 5, as the conversion formula applies to both the numerator and denominator.

   **Impact:** This bug leads to incorrect temperature conversion and affects the accuracy of the calculated value.

   **Location:** Line 9

3. The greatest common divisor (gcd) is not being calculated correctly. The function `gcd` in the code is incorrect. It should be implemented using the Euclidean algorithm, but the current implementation is incorrect.

   **Impact:** This bug affects the reduction of the fraction to its lowest terms and the accuracy of the result.

   **Location:** Lines 14-20

4. The sign of the temperature is not dealt with correctly. If the temperature is negative, the code simply adjusts the sign of the numerator without considering the denominator. This leads to incorrect results when the temperature is negative.

   **Impact:** This bug causes incorrect sign representation of the temperature in the output and affects the overall accuracy of the result.

   **Location:** Lines 23-27

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Remove the extra newline character ("\n") from the input string before splitting it into numerator and denominator.

2. Modify the formula used to calculate the temperature in Celsius by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 5, and then dividing the numerator by 9.

3. Correct the `gcd` function implementation to use the Euclidean algorithm. This can be done by swapping the values of `a` and `b` in the assignment `a, b = b, a % b` inside the while loop.

4. Consider the sign of both the numerator and denominator when adjusting the sign of the temperature. If the denominator is negative, adjust the signs of both the numerator and denominator instead of just the numerator.

### PSEUDOCODE

```
# Get the input as a string
temp = input().strip()

# Remove the extra newline character if present
if temp[-1] == '\n':
    temp = temp[:-1]

# Split the input into numerator and denominator
numerator, denominator = map(int, temp.split('/'))

# Calculate the temperature in Celsius using the corrected formula
celsius_numerator = (numerator - 32) * 5
celsius_denominator = denominator * 9

# Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator to reduce the fraction
while celsius_numerator != 0:
    gcd_value = celsius_numerator
    celsius_numerator = celsius_denominator % celsius_numerator
    celsius_denominator = gcd_value

# Reduce the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by the gcd
celsius_numerator //= gcd_value
celsius_denominator //= gcd_value

# Check if the temperature is negative and adjust the sign of both numerator and denominator accordingly
if celsius_numerator < 0:
    celsius_numerator *= -1
    celsius_denominator *= -1

# Print the result in the required format
print(str(celsius_numerator) + '/' + str(celsius_denominator))
```

### NOTES

Please note that the suggested improvements are based on my understanding of the requirements and expected output. It is possible that there are additional bugs or requirements that are not mentioned in the provided information.
