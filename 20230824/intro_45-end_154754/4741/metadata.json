          "feedback": "### BUGS\n\n1. The input is not being read correctly. There is an extra newline character (\"\\n\") at the end of the input. This newline character is being included in the numerator and denominator values, leading to incorrect calculations.\n\n   **Impact:** This bug causes incorrect temperature conversion and affects the overall functionality of the program.\n\n   **Location:** Line 4\n\n2. The formula used to calculate the temperature in Celsius is incorrect. The numerator should be multiplied by 5 and then divided by 9, not multiplied by 5 directly. Additionally, the denominator should also be multiplied by 5, as the conversion formula applies to both the numerator and denominator.\n\n   **Impact:** This bug leads to incorrect temperature conversion and affects the accuracy of the calculated value.\n\n   **Location:** Line 9\n\n3. The greatest common divisor (gcd) is not being calculated correctly. The function `gcd` in the code is incorrect. It should be implemented using the Euclidean algorithm, but the current implementation is incorrect.\n\n   **Impact:** This bug affects the reduction of the fraction to its lowest terms and the accuracy of the result.\n\n   **Location:** Lines 14-20\n\n4. The sign of the temperature is not dealt with correctly. If the temperature is negative, the code simply adjusts the sign of the numerator without considering the denominator. This leads to incorrect results when the temperature is negative.\n\n   **Impact:** This bug causes incorrect sign representation of the temperature in the output and affects the overall accuracy of the result.\n\n   **Location:** Lines 23-27\n\n### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS\n\n1. Remove the extra newline character (\"\\n\") from the input string before splitting it into numerator and denominator.\n\n2. Modify the formula used to calculate the temperature in Celsius by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 5, and then dividing the numerator by 9.\n\n3. Correct the `gcd` function implementation to use the Euclidean algorithm. This can be done by swapping the values of `a` and `b` in the assignment `a, b = b, a % b` inside the while loop.\n\n4. Consider the sign of both the numerator and denominator when adjusting the sign of the temperature. If the denominator is negative, adjust the signs of both the numerator and denominator instead of just the numerator.\n\n### PSEUDOCODE\n\n```\n# Get the input as a string\ntemp = input().strip()\n\n# Remove the extra newline character if present\nif temp[-1] == '\\n':\n    temp = temp[:-1]\n\n# Split the input into numerator and denominator\nnumerator, denominator = map(int, temp.split('/'))\n\n# Calculate the temperature in Celsius using the corrected formula\ncelsius_numerator = (numerator - 32) * 5\ncelsius_denominator = denominator * 9\n\n# Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator to reduce the fraction\nwhile celsius_numerator != 0:\n    gcd_value = celsius_numerator\n    celsius_numerator = celsius_denominator % celsius_numerator\n    celsius_denominator = gcd_value\n\n# Reduce the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by the gcd\ncelsius_numerator //= gcd_value\ncelsius_denominator //= gcd_value\n\n# Check if the temperature is negative and adjust the sign of both numerator and denominator accordingly\nif celsius_numerator < 0:\n    celsius_numerator *= -1\n    celsius_denominator *= -1\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(str(celsius_numerator) + '/' + str(celsius_denominator))\n```\n\n### NOTES\n\nPlease note that the suggested improvements are based on my understanding of the requirements and expected output.
