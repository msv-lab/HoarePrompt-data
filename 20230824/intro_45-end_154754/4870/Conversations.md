I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are on your way to your first job interview as a program tester, and you are already late. The interview is in a skyscraper and you are currently in floor $s$, where you see an elevator. Upon entering the elvator, you learn that it has only two buttons, marked “UP $u$” and “DOWN$d$”. You conclude that the UP-button takes the elevator $u$ floors up (if there aren’t enough floors, pressing the UP-botton does nothing, or at least so you assume), whereas the DOWN-button takes you $d$ stories down (or none if there aren’t enough). Knowing that the interview is at floor $g$, and that there are only $f$ floors in the building, you quickly decide to write a program that gives you the amount of button pushes you need to perform. If you simply cannot reach the correct floor, your program halts with the message “use the stairs”.

Given input $f$, $s$, $g$, $u$ and $d$ (floors, start, goal, up, down), find the shortest sequence of button presses you must press in order to get from $s$ to $g$, given a building of $f$ floors, or output “use the stairs” if you cannot get from $s$ to $g$ by the given elevator.

-----Input-----
The input will consist of one line with the five integers $f$, $s$, $g$, $u$, and $d$, where $1 \leq s,g \leq f \leq 1000000$ and $0 \leq u,d \leq 1000000$. The floors are one-indexed, i.e., if there are 10 stories, $s$ and $g$ are between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive).

-----Output-----
Output the minimum numbers of pushes you must make in order to get from $s$ to $g$, or output use the stairs if it is impossible given the configuration of the elvator.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
10 1 10 2 1
Sample Output:
6
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS
