          "feedback": "### Review\n\nThe code you provided has the main logic of finding the greedily increasing subsequence (GIS) correct. However, there are a few bugs and improvements that can be made. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Line 7: The variable `max_gis` should be initialized as `float('-inf')` instead of `a[0]`. This is because `float('-inf')` represents negative infinity, and it ensures that the first element of `a` is always considered as the start of the GIS.\n\n2. Line 11: The condition `elif a[i] == max_gis` should be removed. This condition is not necessary because it is already covered in the previous condition `a[i] > max_gis`. By removing this condition, you can avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\n3. Line 13: Instead of using `break` in the `else` condition, you should continue iterating until the end of the list `a`. This is because there might be other elements that could be part of the GIS, even if they are smaller than the current `max_gis`.\n\n4. Line 16: The code correctly prints the length of the GIS, but it does not print the actual GIS correctly. This is because the loop only adds elements greater than `max_gis` to `gis`, but it does not remove the smaller elements that were added earlier. To fix this, you can modify line 13 to append the element to `gis` even if it is smaller than `max_gis`, and then use a `set` to remove duplicates before printing.\n\n5. Line 17: You can simplify the code for printing `gis` by using the `join` method directly on the list `gis` instead of converting each element to a string individually.\n\nNow, let's summarize the bugs and improvements:\n\nBugs:\n1. Line 7: Initialize `max_gis` as `float('-inf')` instead of `a[0]`.\n2. Line 11: Remove the condition `elif a[i] == max_gis`.\n3. Line 13: Remove `break` and continue iterating until the end of the list `a`.\n4. Line 16: Remove duplicates from `gis` before printing.\n\nImprovements:\n1. Line 17: Use `join` method directly on the list `gis` for printing.\n\nAfter making these changes, the code should work correctly and produce the expected output.",
