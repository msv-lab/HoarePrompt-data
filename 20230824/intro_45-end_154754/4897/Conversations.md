I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are the coach of the national athletics team and need to select which sprinters should represent your country in the $4 \times 100$ m relay in the upcoming championships. 

As the name of the event implies, such a sprint relay consist of $4$ legs, $100$ meters each. One would think that the best team would simply consist of the $4$ fastest $100$ m runners in the nation, but there is an important detail to take into account: flying start. In the $2$nd, $3$rd and $4$th leg, the runner is already running when the baton is handed over. This means that some runners – those that have a slow acceleration phase – can perform relatively better in a relay if they are on the $2$nd, $3$rd or $4$th leg.

You have a pool of runners to choose from. Given how fast each runner in the pool is, decide which four runners should represent your national team and which leg they should run. You are given two times for each runner – the time the runner would run the $1$st leg, and the time the runner would run any of the other legs. A runner in a team can only run one leg.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains an integer $n$, the number of runners to choose from ($4 \leq n \leq 500$). Then follow $n$ lines describing the runners. The $i$’th of these lines contains the name of the $i$’th runner, the time $a_ i$ for the runner to run the $1$st leg, and the time $b_ i$ for the runner to run any of the other legs ($8 \le b_ i \le a_ i < 20$). The names consist of between $2$ and $20$ (inclusive) uppercase letters ‘A’-‘Z’, and no two runners have the same name. The times are given in seconds with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

-----Output-----
First, output a line containing the time of the best team, accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-9}$. Then output four lines containing the names of the runners in that team. The first of these lines should contain the runner you have picked for the $1$st leg, the second line the runner you have picked for the $2$nd leg, and so on. Any solution that results in the fastest team is acceptable.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
6
ASHMEADE 9.90 8.85
BLAKE 9.69 8.72
BOLT 9.58 8.43
CARTER 9.78 8.93
FRATER 9.88 8.92
POWELL 9.72 8.61
Sample Output:
35.54
CARTER
BOLT
POWELL
BLAKE
### Requirements

2. You will NOT return anything except for the program.

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. **IndexError:** The `selected_sprinters` list is being populated incorrectly in the `for` loop. The index `i+1` is being used to access the other leg time for each runner, but this will result in an "index out of range" error because the tuples in the `runners` list only have three elements (name, first leg time, and other leg time).

2. **Total Time Calculation:** The total time calculation is incorrect. Instead of summing the other leg times of the selected sprinters, the code is summing the other leg times of the first four runners in the sorted list `runners`. This will result in an incorrect total time.

3. **Printing of Names:** The code is currently printing the names of the selected sprinters incorrectly. It is printing the tuple itself instead of just the name.

4. **Output Format:** The total time is being printed with only two decimal places, but the expected output shows the total time with four decimal places.

### IMPACT

These bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:

1. The bug in the `selected_sprinters` list population causes the code to raise an `IndexError` at runtime. This prevents the program from producing the correct output.

2. The incorrect total time calculation means that the program will output an incorrect time for the best team. This means that the program will not select the optimal team of sprinters.

3. The incorrect printing of names in the output means that the program will produce an output that does not match the expected output format.

4. The incorrect format of the total time in the output also means that the program's output will not match the expected output format.
