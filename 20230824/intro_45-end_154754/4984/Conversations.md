I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You are mapping a faraway planet using a satellite. The planet’s surface can be modeled as a grid. The satellite has captured an image of the surface. Each grid square is either land (denoted as ‘L’), water (denoted as ‘W’), or covered by clouds (denoted as ‘C’). Clouds mean that the surface could either be land or water; you cannot tell.

An island is a region of land where every grid cell in the island is connected to every other by some path, and every leg of the path only goes up, down, left or right.

Given an image, determine the minimum number of islands that is consistent with the given image.

-----Input-----
Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two integers, $r$ and $c$ ($1 \le r, c \le 50$), which are the number of rows and the number of columns of the image. The next $r$ lines will each contain exactly $c$ characters, consisting only of ‘L’ (representing Land), ‘W’ (representing Water), and ‘C’ (representing Clouds).

-----Output-----
Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of islands possible.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
4 5
CCCCC
CCCCC
CCCCC
CCCCC
Sample Output:
0
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are a few bugs in the code that are leading to the incorrect output:

1. The function `exploreIsland()` is not correctly defined. It is missing the return type.
2. The condition `if grid[i][j] != 'L'` in the `exploreIsland()` function is incorrect. It should check if the current cell is not equal to 'C' instead of 'L'.
3. The condition `if grid[i][j] == 'L' and not visited[i][j]` in the `countIslands()` function is incorrect. It should check if the current cell is not equal to 'C' instead of 'L'.
4. The initialization of the `visited` matrix in the `countIslands()` function is incorrect. It should initialize to `True` for cells with 'C' instead of `False`.
5. The counting of islands is incorrect. It should be incremented before calling the `exploreIsland()` function instead of after calling it.

Let's go through each bug in detail:

Bug 1: The `exploreIsland()` function is not correctly defined. It is missing the return type.
```python
def exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited):
```
Fix: Add the return type `None` to the function definition.
```python
def exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited) -> None:
```

Bug 2: The condition `if grid[i][j] != 'L'` in the `exploreIsland()` function is incorrect.
```python
if grid[i][j] != 'L':
    return
```
Fix: Change the condition to `if grid[i][j] != 'C'`.
```python
if grid[i][j] != 'C':
    return
```

Bug 3: The condition `if grid[i][j] == 'L' and not visited[i][j]` in the `countIslands()` function is incorrect.
```python
if grid[i][j] == 'L' and not visited[i][j]:
    exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited)
    count += 1
```
Fix: Change the condition to `if grid[i][j] != 'C' and not visited[i][j]`.
```python
if grid[i][j] != 'C' and not visited[i][j]:
    exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited)
    count += 1
```

Bug 4: The initialization of the `visited` matrix in the `countIslands()` function is incorrect.
```python
visited = [[False for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]
```
Fix: Change the initialization to set `True` for cells with 'C'.
```python
visited = [[grid[i][j] == 'C' for j in range(len(grid[0]))] for i in range(len(grid))]
```

Bug 5: The counting of islands is incorrect.
```python
count = 0

for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        if grid[i][j] != 'C' and not visited[i][j]:
            exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited)
            count += 1
```
Fix: Increment `count` before calling the `exploreIsland()` function.
```python
count = 0

for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        if grid[i][j] != 'C' and not visited[i][j]:
            count += 1
            exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited)
```

With these fixes, the code should now return the correct minimum number of islands.

The correct code is as follows:

```python
def exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited) -> None:
    # Mark current cell as visited
    visited[i][j] = True

    # If the current cell is not land, return
    if grid[i][j] != 'C':
        return

    # Check the adjacent cells
    # Up
    if i > 0 and not visited[i - 1][j]:
        exploreIsland(grid, i - 1, j, visited)
    # Down
    if i < len(grid) - 1 and not visited[i + 1][j]:
        exploreIsland(grid, i + 1, j, visited)
    # Left
    if j > 0 and not visited[i][j - 1]:
        exploreIsland(grid, i, j - 1, visited)
    # Right
    if j < len(grid[0]) - 1 and not visited[i][j + 1]:
        exploreIsland(grid, i, j + 1, visited)


def countIslands(grid):
    # Initialize visited matrix
    visited = [[grid[i][j] == 'C' for j in range(len(grid[0]))] for i in range(len(grid))]

    # Initialize count of islands
    count = 0

    # Traverse the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            # If a land cell is found that has not been visited, it is a new island
            if grid[i][j] != 'C' and not visited[i][j]:
                count += 1
                exploreIsland(grid, i, j, visited)

    return count


# Read the number of rows and columns
r, c = map(int, input().split())

# Read the image/grid
grid = [list(input()) for _ in range(r)]

# Count the minimum number of islands
min_islands = countIslands(grid)

# Print the result
print(min_islands)
```

Test Input Reasoning:
We test for a basic input where the grid consists of only one land cell.

Test Input:
1 1
L

Test Output Reasoning:
Since there is only one land cell in the grid, it forms an island. Therefore, the minimum number of islands is 1.

Test Output:
1
