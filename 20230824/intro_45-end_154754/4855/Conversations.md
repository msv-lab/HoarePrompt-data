I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The impact factor of a scientific journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in science journals. For this task we are using a simplified formula for calculating the impact factor:\[ \frac{\text {Total count of citations received by articles published in the journal}}{\text {Total number of articles published}} \]

Rounding is always performed upwards. For example the impact factor of the “Journal for ore research and time wasting” that published $38$ articles cited $894$ times is $894 / 38 = 23.53$ rounding up to $24$.

You are the editor of one scientific journal. You know how many articles you are going to publish and the owners are pushing you to reach a specific impact factor. You are wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite your articles to meet the owners demands. Since money is tight you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists. Each bribed scientist buys you a single citation.

-----Input-----
First and only line of input will contain $2$ integers, $A$ ($1 \leq A \leq 100$), the number of articles you plan to publish and $I$ ($1 \leq I \leq 100$), the impact factor the owners require.

-----Output-----
The first and only line of output should contain one integer, the minimal number of scientists you need to bribe.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
38 24
Sample Output 1:
875

Sample Input 2:
1 100
Sample Output 2:
100
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
A, I = map(int, input().split())
scientists = (A * I) - A
print(scientists)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "38 24
" the output was "874
" but the expected output was "875
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#

### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
A, I = map(int, input().split())
scientists = (A * I) - A
print(scientists)
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "38 24
" the output was "874
" but the expected output was "875
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The given code has a simple mathematical equation to calculate the minimal number of scientists to bribe. However, there is a bug in the equation that leads to incorrect output in some cases. Let's analyze the code in detail:

### BUG 1
```python
scientists = (A * I) - A
```
The formula used to calculate the minimal number of scientists to bribe is incorrect. The first term, `(A * I)`, calculates the total number of citations needed to meet the impact factor requirement. However, subtracting `A` from this value is incorrect. Including `A` in the equation will lead to fewer scientists being bribed than necessary.

### EXAMPLE
Take the example input where `A = 38` and `I = 24`. The expected output is `875`, but the actual output `874` is incorrect.

Let's analyze the code with this input:
```python
scientists = (38 * 24) - 38
```
This simplifies to:
```python
scientists = 912 - 38
```
So, `scientists` is assigned the value `874` instead of the expected `875`.

### IMPACT
The incorrect formula underestimates the number of scientists needed to meet the impact factor requirement. This means that the actual output will always be one less than the expected output. The impact will be significant when the required impact factor is high and the number of articles published is relatively small. It may result in the owner's demand not being reached and the journal's reputation being compromised.

### BUG 2 (POSSIBLE)
There is a possibility of another bug when rounding the impact factor value. The problem statement clearly states that rounding should always be performed upwards. The given code does not perform any rounding, so it is unclear whether the impact factor should be rounded up or not. To fix this bug, we need to consider rounding the impact factor value.

### SUGGESTION
Here are the suggested fixes for the bugs:

1. Use the correct formula to calculate the minimal number of scientists to bribe:

```python
scientists = (A * I) - (A - 1)
```

2. Consider rounding the impact factor upwards if necessary.

### Conclusion
The given code has an incorrect formula for calculating the minimal number of scientists to bribe. It underestimates the number of scientists needed to meet the impact factor requirement. Additionally, it does not consider rounding the impact factor upwards. To fix the code, the correct formula `(A * I) - (A - 1)` should be used, and rounding should be performed when necessary.
