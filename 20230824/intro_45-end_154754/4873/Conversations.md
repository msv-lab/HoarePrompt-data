I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
We’re building an old-school back-to-basics computer game. It’s a very simple text based adventure game where you walk around and try to find treasure, avoiding falling into traps. The game is played on a rectangular grid and the player gets very limited information about her surroundings.

The game will consist of the player moving around on the grid for as long as she likes (or until she falls into a trap). The player can move up, down, left and right (but not diagonally). She will pick up gold if she walks into the same square as the gold is. If the player stands next to (i.e., immediately up, down, left, or right of) one or more traps, she will “sense a draft” but will not know from what direction the draft comes, or how many traps she’s near. If she tries to walk into a square containing a wall, she will notice that there is a wall in that direction and remain in the position where she was.

For scoring purposes, we want to show the player how much gold she could have gotten safely. That is, how much gold can a player get playing with an optimal strategy and always being sure that the square she walked into was safe. The player does not have access to the map and the maps are randomly generated for each game so she has no previous knowledge of the game.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains two positive integers $W$ and $H$, neither of them smaller than $3$ or larger than $50$, giving the width and the height of the map, respectively. The next $H$ lines contain $W$ characters each, giving the map. The symbols that may occur in a map are as follows:

P

the player’s starting position

G

a piece of gold

T

a trap

#

a wall

.

normal floor

There will be exactly one ’P’ in the map, and the border of the map will always contain walls.

-----Output-----
Output the number of pieces of gold the player can get without risking falling into a trap.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
7 4
#######
#P.GTG#
#..TGG#
#######
Sample Output:
1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the given code:

1. In the `count_gold` function, the `x` and `y` variables where the player's starting position is stored are not being initialized correctly. They are being overwritten inside the for loop, so the value of `x` and `y` will always be the values of the last occurrence of "P" in the map.

2. The `directions` list is defined outside of the `dfs` function and is not accessible inside the function. Either it should be passed as an argument to the `dfs` function or defined inside the `dfs` function.

3. The `max_gold` variable is being passed as an argument to the `dfs` function, but any changes made to it inside the function will not be reflected outside the function. This is because integers are immutable objects in Python. To fix this, we can use a mutable object like a list to store the maximum gold. Then, any changes made to the list inside the `dfs` function will be reflected outside the function.

4. The `dfs` function is missing the base case to stop the recursion. Without a base case, the function will continue to make recursive calls indefinitely. We need to add a condition to stop the recursion when a trap is encountered.

5. The `dfs` function is missing a condition to check if a cell has already been visited. Without this condition, the function may enter into an infinite loop if there is a cycle in the map.

6. The `dfs` function is missing the line of code to remove a cell from the `visited` set when backtracking. Without this line of code, the function may incorrectly consider a cell as visited and skip it in future iterations.

7. The `dfs` function is missing a line of code to backtrack after exploring all possible directions. Without this line of code, the function will not explore all possible paths.

### BUGS

1. The `x` and `y` variables used to store the player's starting position are not being initialized correctly.

2. The `directions` list is defined outside of the `dfs` function and is not accessible inside the function.

3. The `max_gold` variable is being passed as an argument to the `dfs` function, but any changes made to it inside the function will not be reflected outside the function.

4. The `dfs` function is missing the base case to stop the recursion.

5. The `dfs` function is missing a condition to check if a cell has already been visited.

6. The `dfs` function is missing the line of code to remove a cell from the `visited` set when backtracking.

7. The `dfs` function is missing a line of code to backtrack after exploring all possible directions.

### IMPACT

1. The incorrect initialization of `x` and `y` variables will affect the starting position of the player, resulting in the wrong calculation of the maximum gold.

2. The inaccessibility of the `directions` list inside the `dfs` function will result in a NameError when trying to access it.

3. The incorrect passing of `max_gold` as an argument to the `dfs` function will result in the incorrect updating of the maximum gold value.

4. The missing base case in the `dfs` function will cause the recursion to continue indefinitely, resulting in a StackOverflowError.

5. The missing condition to check if a cell has already been visited will cause the function to enter into an infinite loop if there is a cycle in the map.

6. The missing line of code to remove a cell from the `visited` set when backtracking will result in incorrect path traversal and may lead to skipping cells.

7. The missing line of code to backtrack after exploring all possible directions will result in incomplete path traversal and may lead to missing possible paths.
