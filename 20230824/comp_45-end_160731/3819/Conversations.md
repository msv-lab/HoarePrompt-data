I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards.

One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones.

There are $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$, and they were mixed with another $n$ empty cards. She piled up the $2n$ cards and drew $n$ of them. The $n$ cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining $n$ cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom.

In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it — put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile.

Nauuo wants to make the $n$ numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the $i$-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card $i$) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$) — the number of numbered cards.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($0\le a_i\le n$) — the initial cards in Nauuo's hands. $0$ represents an empty card.

The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ ($0\le b_i\le n$) — the initial cards in the pile, given in order from top to bottom. $0$ represents an empty card.

It is guaranteed that each number from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once, either in $a_{1..n}$ or $b_{1..n}$.


-----Output-----

The output contains a single integer — the minimum number of operations to make the $n$ numbered cards piled up in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 2 0
3 0 1

Output
2
Input
3
0 2 0
1 0 3

Output
4
Input
11
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 0 11
9 2 6 0 8 1 7 0 3 0 10

Output
18


-----Note-----

Example 1

We can play the card $2$ and draw the card $3$ in the first operation. After that, we have $[0,3,0]$ in hands and the cards in the pile are $[0,1,2]$ from top to bottom.

Then, we play the card $3$ in the second operation. The cards in the pile are $[1,2,3]$, in which the cards are piled up in increasing order.

Example 2

Play an empty card and draw the card $1$, then play $1$, $2$, $3$ in order.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are some bugs in the provided code that cause incorrect output.

**Bug 1:** The code does not handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. In this case, the code incorrectly removes cards from the pile and increments the count.

**Bug 2:** The code does not correctly handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. It only removes a single card from the pile and increments the count by 1, which is incorrect.

### BUG 1
The first bug is that the code does not handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. In this case, the code incorrectly removes cards from the pile and increments the count.

Consider the test case where `n = 3`, `hand = [0, 2, 0]`, and `pile = [3, 0, 1]`. The expected output is 2.

In the first iteration of the for loop, `i = 1`. Since 1 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the second iteration of the loop, `i = 2`. Since 2 is in the hand, it is removed from the hand. Now `hand = [0, 0]`.

In the third iteration of the loop, `i = 3`. Since 3 is in the pile, the code finds its index as 0 and removes all cards before it from the pile. Now `pile = []`.

The code increments the count by 1 because one card was removed from the pile.

At the end, the count is 1, but the expected output is 2.

### BUG 2
The second bug is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. It only removes a single card from the pile and increments the count by 1, which is incorrect.

Consider the test case where `n = 3`, `hand = [0, 2, 0]`, and `pile = [1, 0, 3]`. The expected output is 4.

In the first iteration of the for loop, `i = 1`. Since 1 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the second iteration of the loop, `i = 2`. Since 2 is in the hand, it is removed from the hand. Now `hand = [0, 0]`.

In the third iteration of the loop, `i = 3`. Since 3 is in the pile, the code finds its index as 2 and removes all cards before it from the pile. Now `pile = [3]`.

The code increments the count by 3 because three cards were removed from the pile.

At the end, the count is 3, but the expected output is 4.

### BUG 3
The third bug is that the code does not handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. In this case, the code incorrectly removes cards from the pile and increments the count.

Consider the test case where `n = 11`, `hand = [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 11]`, and `pile = [9, 2, 6, 0, 8, 1, 7, 0, 3, 0, 10]`. The expected output is 18.

In the first iteration of the for loop, `i = 1`. Since 1 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the second iteration of the loop, `i = 2`. Since 2 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the third iteration of the loop, `i = 3`. Since 3 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the fourth iteration of the loop, `i = 4`. Since 4 is in the hand, it is removed from the hand. Now `hand = [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11]`.

In the fifth iteration of the loop, `i = 5`. Since 5 is not in the hand or the pile, nothing happens.

In the sixth iteration of the loop, `i = 6`. Since 6 is in the pile, the code finds its index as 2 and removes all cards before it from the pile. Now `pile = [6, 0, 8, 1, 7, 0, 3, 0, 10]`.

The code increments the count by 3 because three cards were removed from the pile.

In the seventh iteration of the loop, `i = 7`. Since 7 is in the pile, the code finds its index as 6 and removes all cards before it from the pile. Now `pile = [3, 0, 10]`.

The code increments the count by 7 because seven cards were removed from the pile.

At the end, the count is 10, but the expected output is 18.

### BUG 1
The first bug is that the code does not handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. In this case, the code incorrectly removes cards from the pile and increments the count.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to check if the current pile on the top is empty and if the number is in the pile. If both conditions are true, we should find the index of the number in the remaining pile, remove all cards before it, and update the pile. Additionally, we should increment the count by the number of cards removed from the pile.

Here's the corrected code for this bug:

```python
n = int(input())
hand = list(map(int, input().split()))
pile = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the count variable to keep track of the minimum number of operations
count = 0

# Iterate from 1 to n and check if the current number is in the hand or pile
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i in hand:
        # If the number is in the hand, remove it from the hand
        hand.remove(i)
    elif pile and i in pile:
        # If the number is in the pile and the current pile on the top is not empty
        # Find the index of the number in the remaining pile, remove all cards before it, and update the pile
        index = pile[pile.index(i)+1:]
        pile = pile[index:]
        # Increment the count variable by the number of cards removed from the pile
        count += len(index)

# Print the minimum number of operations
print(count)
```

### BUG 2
The second bug is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. It only removes a single card from the pile and increments the count by 1, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to find the index of the number in the pile and remove all cards before it, just like we did in Bug 1. Additionally, we should increment the count by the number of cards removed from the pile.

Here's the corrected code for this bug:

```python
n = int(input())
hand = list(map(int, input().split()))
pile = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the count variable to keep track of the minimum number of operations
count = 0

# Iterate from 1 to n and check if the current number is in the hand or pile
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i in hand:
        # If the number is in the hand, remove it from the hand
        hand.remove(i)
    elif pile and i in pile:
        # If the number is in the pile and the current pile on the top is not empty
        # Find the index of the number in the remaining pile, remove all cards before it, and update the pile
        index = pile[pile.index(i)+1:]
        pile = pile[index:]
        # Increment the count variable by the number of cards removed from the pile
        count += len(index)

# Print the minimum number of operations
print(count)
```

### BUG 3
The third bug is that the code does not handle the case when the number is in the pile but not in the current pile on the top. In this case, the code incorrectly removes cards from the pile and increments the count.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to check if the current pile on the top is empty and if the number is in the pile. If both conditions are true, we should find the index of the number in the remaining pile, remove all cards before it, and update the pile. Additionally, we should increment the count by the number of cards removed from the pile.

Here's the corrected code for this bug:

```python
n = int(input())
hand = list(map(int, input().split()))
pile = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize the count variable to keep track of the minimum number of operations
count = 0

# Iterate from 1 to n and check if the current number is in the hand or pile
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i in hand:
        # If the number is in the hand, remove it from the hand
        hand.remove(i)
    elif pile and i in pile:
        # If the number is in the pile and the current pile on the top is not empty
        # Find the index of the number in the remaining pile, remove all cards before it, and update the pile
        index = pile[pile.index(i)+1:]
        pile = pile[index:]
        # Increment the count variable by the number of cards removed from the pile
        count += len(index)

# Print the minimum number of operations
print(count)
