I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Jeff got 2n real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n as a birthday present. The boy hates non-integer numbers, so he decided to slightly "adjust" the numbers he's got. Namely, Jeff consecutively executes n operations, each of them goes as follows:  choose indexes i and j (i ≠ j) that haven't been chosen yet;  round element a_{i} to the nearest integer that isn't more than a_{i} (assign to a_{i}: ⌊ a_{i} ⌋);  round element a_{j} to the nearest integer that isn't less than a_{j} (assign to a_{j}: ⌈ a_{j} ⌉). 

Nevertheless, Jeff doesn't want to hurt the feelings of the person who gave him the sequence. That's why the boy wants to perform the operations so as to make the absolute value of the difference between the sum of elements before performing the operations and the sum of elements after performing the operations as small as possible. Help Jeff find the minimum absolute value of the difference.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains 2n real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), given with exactly three digits after the decimal point. The numbers are separated by spaces.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single real number — the required difference with exactly three digits after the decimal point.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0.000 0.500 0.750 1.000 2.000 3.000

Output
0.250

Input
3
4469.000 6526.000 4864.000 9356.383 7490.000 995.896

Output
0.279



-----Note-----

In the first test case you need to perform the operations as follows: (i = 1, j = 4), (i = 2, j = 3), (i = 5, j = 6). In this case, the difference will equal |(0 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 1 + 2 + 3) - (0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3)| = 0.25.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
The given code has some bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's go through the code to identify and discuss the bugs:

### Bug 1: Incorrect index calculation
In the line `numbers[-(i+1)] = int(numbers[-(i+1)]) + 1`, the indexing is incorrect. It should be `numbers[-(n-i-1)]` instead of `numbers[-(i+1)]`. This bug is causing the last n numbers to be rounded up incorrectly.

### Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of original sum
The line `original_sum = sum(numbers) - n` is calculating the original sum incorrectly. It should calculate the sum of the original numbers, not the modified numbers. The bug causes the original sum to be too low, resulting in an incorrect difference.

### Bug 3: Incorrect calculation of adjusted sum
The line `adjusted_sum = sum(numbers)` is calculating the adjusted sum incorrectly. It should calculate the sum of the modified numbers, not the original numbers. This bug causes the adjusted sum to be too high, resulting in an incorrect difference.

### Bug 4: Incorrect rounding of numbers
The line `numbers[i] = int(numbers[i])` is rounding the numbers down, but the task requires rounding to the nearest integer that is not more than the original number. To achieve this, instead of using `int()`, we need to use the `math.floor()` function. Similarly, the line `numbers[-(n-i-1)] = int(numbers[-(n-i-1)]) + 1` is rounding the numbers up, but it should round to the nearest integer that is not less than the original number. To achieve this, we need to use the `math.ceil()` function.

Now that we have identified the bugs, let's summarize them and their impact on the functionality of the program:

- Bug 1: Incorrect index calculation: This bug causes the last n numbers to be rounded up incorrectly.
- Bug 2: Incorrect calculation of original sum: This bug causes the original sum to be too low, resulting in an incorrect difference.
- Bug 3: Incorrect calculation of adjusted sum: This bug causes the adjusted sum to be too high, resulting in an incorrect difference.
- Bug 4: Incorrect rounding of numbers: This bug causes the numbers to be rounded incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect difference.

These bugs collectively cause incorrect output and need to be fixed for the program to work correctly.

### ANSWER

Here's the corrected code with the bugs fixed:

#@!CODE START!@#
import math

n = int(input())
numbers = list(map(float, input().split()))

# Sort the numbers in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Round the first n numbers down and the last n numbers up
for i in range(n):
    numbers[i] = math.floor(numbers[i])
    numbers[-(n-i-1)] = math.ceil(numbers[-(n-i-1)])

# Calculate the difference between the original sum and the adjusted sum
original_sum = sum(numbers[:n])
adjusted_sum = sum(numbers[n:])

# Calculate the minimum absolute difference
min_absolute_diff = abs(original_sum - adjusted_sum)

# Print the result with exactly three digits after the decimal point
print("{:.3f}".format(min_absolute_diff))
#@!CODE END!@#

I'll be happy to help you with any other questions.
