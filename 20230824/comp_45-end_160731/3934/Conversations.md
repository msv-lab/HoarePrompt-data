I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.

You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. In the beginning, $0$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$.

For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $2$ on the path from $7$ to $6$, and then adding $-0.5$ on the path from $4$ to $5$. 

 [Image] 

Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?

Leaf is a node of a tree of degree $1$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of nodes.

Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \neq v$), meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.


-----Output-----

If there is a configuration of real numbers written on edges of the tree that we can't achieve by performing the operations, output "NO". 

Otherwise, output "YES". 

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 2

Output
YES
Input
3
1 2
2 3

Output
NO
Input
5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5

Output
NO
Input
6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6

Output
YES


-----Note-----

In the first example, we can add any real $x$ to the value written on the only edge $(1, 2)$.

 [Image] 

In the second example, one of configurations that we can't reach is $0$ written on $(1, 2)$ and $1$ written on $(2, 3)$.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2
1 2
" the output was "YES
" but the expected output was "YES".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided appears to be an initial implementation of the problem solution. Let's review the code and identify any potential bugs or errors.


#### 1. Inconsistent Output:
The code returns the expected result "YES" even when it shouldn't. This discrepancy can be observed in the first example, where the expected output is "YES," but the code gives "YES\n".

#### 2. Incorrect Degree Computation:
The code uses a `defaultdict` to keep track of the degree of each node in the tree. However, the degree of a node is incorrectly computed. The code increments the degree of both endpoints of an edge but doesn't consider that each endpoint is connected to only one other node. As a result, the degree count is incorrect and can lead to incorrect decisions when determining if a configuration can be achieved.

#### 3. Incorrect Output:
The code returns "NO" if any node has a degree of 2. However, this condition is incorrect. The problem requires that any leaf node be connected with exactly two edges. Therefore, having a degree of two shouldn't immediately disqualify a configuration. 

#### 4. Unnecessary Loop:
The code iterates through the values of the `degrees` dictionary to check if any node has a degree of 2. However, this loop is unnecessary because the code can simply check if the length of the `degrees` dictionary is less than 4. If it is, then it means there are only 2 or 3 nodes, which is always a valid configuration.

#### 5. Inefficient Input Parsing:
The code reads the input directly using `input()`, which requires manual parsing and error handling. This approach can lead to errors if the input format is not as expected. It would be better to use a function that takes inputs as arguments and returns results.

#### 6. Incomplete Input Validation:
The code doesn't validate the input to ensure it meets the given constraints. It doesn't check if the number of nodes is within the acceptable range, or if the edges form a valid tree structure.


### Suggestions:

Based on the identified issues, here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Fix the inconsistent output by removing the line break ("\n") from the return statement.

2. Update the degree computation to correctly determine the degree of each node.

3. Modify the condition for determining if a configuration is possible. Instead of checking for nodes with a degree of 2, check if the length of the `degrees` dictionary is less than 4.

4. Restructure the code to use a function that takes inputs as arguments and returns the result. This will make it easier to test the code with different inputs and facilitate future modifications.

5. Validate the input to ensure it meets the specified constraints.

Let's move on to modify the code based on these suggestions.

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE
```python
def can_achieve_configuration(n, edges):
    degrees = {}
    
    # Compute the degree of each node
    for u, v in edges:
        degrees[u] = degrees.get(u, 0) + 1
        degrees[v] = degrees.get(v, 0) + 1
        
    # Check if a valid configuration is possible
    if len(degrees) < 4:
        return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Read inputs
n = int(input())
edges = []
for _ in range(n-1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((u, v))

# Call the function and print the result
result = can_achieve_configuration(n, edges)
print(result)
```
The code has been modified based on the given suggestions and should now work correctly. 

Let's walk through the changes made:

1. The function `can_achieve_configuration` takes two arguments - `n` (the number of nodes in the tree) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges between the nodes).

2. The `degrees` dictionary is now initially empty. We will compute the degree of each node and store it in this dictionary.

3. In the for loop where we iterate over the edges, we update the degree of each endpoint by using `degrees.get(node, 0)` to get the current degree of the node (or 0 if it doesn't exist) and incrementing it by 1.

4. Instead of checking for nodes with a degree of 2, we now check if the length of the `degrees` dictionary is less than 4. If it is, then we return "YES" because a valid configuration is possible.

5. Finally, we read the inputs, call the `can_achieve_configuration` function, and print the result.
