I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Elections in Berland are coming. There are only two candidates — Alice and Bob.

The main Berland TV channel plans to show political debates. There are $n$ people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator. Each person is described by their influence and political views. There are four kinds of political views:  supporting none of candidates (this kind is denoted as "00"),  supporting Alice but not Bob (this kind is denoted as "10"),  supporting Bob but not Alice (this kind is denoted as "01"),  supporting both candidates (this kind is denoted as "11"). 

The direction of the TV channel wants to invite some of these people to the debate. The set of invited spectators should satisfy three conditions:  at least half of spectators support Alice (i.e. $2 \cdot a \ge m$, where $a$ is number of spectators supporting Alice and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  at least half of spectators support Bob (i.e. $2 \cdot b \ge m$, where $b$ is number of spectators supporting Bob and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  the total influence of spectators is maximal possible. 

Help the TV channel direction to select such non-empty set of spectators, or tell that this is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 4\cdot10^5$) — the number of people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator.

These people are described on the next $n$ lines. Each line describes a single person and contains the string $s_i$ and integer $a_i$ separated by space ($1 \le a_i \le 5000$), where $s_i$ denotes person's political views (possible values — "00", "10", "01", "11") and $a_i$ — the influence of the $i$-th person.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — maximal possible total influence of a set of spectators so that at least half of them support Alice and at least half of them support Bob. If it is impossible print 0 instead.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
11 6
10 4
01 3
00 3
00 7
00 9

Output
22

Input

Output

Input
3
00 5000
00 5000
00 5000

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example $4$ spectators can be invited to maximize total influence: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $6$. Their political views are: "11", "10", "01" and "00". So in total $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Alice and $2$ out of $4$ spectators support Bob. The total influence is $6+4+3+9=22$.

In the second example the direction can select all the people except the $5$-th person.

In the third example the direction can select people with indices: $1$, $4$, $5$ and $6$.

In the fourth example it is impossible to select any non-empty set of spectators.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

" the output was "0

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the code:

1. The condition for inviting spectators is incorrectly checked. The correct condition is `alice_count >= n/2 and bob_count >= n/2`, but the code mistakenly checks `alice_count >= n/2 and bob_count > n/2`.

2. The code fails to consider the case where there are not enough spectators who support Alice and Bob to fulfill the condition. In this case, the code should output 0, but the code does not handle this case.

3. The code incorrectly calculates `remaining_alice` and `remaining_bob`. These variables should represent the number of remaining spectators needed to fulfill the condition for Alice and Bob respectively, but the code sets them to the difference between the lengths of the supporter lists and the count variables.

4. The code does not handle the case where there are not enough neutral supporters to fill the remaining spots for Alice or Bob. It incorrectly assumes that there will always be enough neutral supporters to fill the remaining spots.

5. The code does not handle the case where there are not enough both supporters to fill the remaining spots for Alice and Bob. It incorrectly assumes that there will always be enough both supporters to fill the remaining spots.

6. The code does not consider the case where there are not enough spectators to form a set that satisfies the condition. In this case, the code should output 0, but it does not handle this case.

### BUGS
The bugs are:

1. The condition for inviting spectators is incorrectly checked.
2. The code fails to handle the case where there are not enough supporters to fulfill the condition.
3. The code incorrectly calculates `remaining_alice` and `remaining_bob`.
4. The code does not handle the case where there are not enough neutral supporters.
5. The code does not handle the case where there are not enough both supporters.
6. The code does not consider the case where there are not enough spectators.

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE
Here is the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())

spectators = []
for _ in range(n):
    s, a = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    spectators.append((s, a))

alice_supporters = []
bob_supporters = []
neutral_supporters = []
both_supporters = []

for s, a in spectators:
    if s == "10":
        alice_supporters.append(a)
    elif s == "01":
        bob_supporters.append(a)
    elif s == "00":
        neutral_supporters.append(a)
    elif s == "11":
        both_supporters.append(a)

alice_supporters.sort(reverse=True)
bob_supporters.sort(reverse=True)
neutral_supporters.sort(reverse=True)
both_supporters.sort(reverse=True)

total_influence = 0
alice_count = 0
bob_count = 0

for i in range(min(len(alice_supporters), len(bob_supporters))):
    total_influence += alice_supporters[i]
    total_influence += bob_supporters[i]
    alice_count += 1
    bob_count += 1

remaining_alice = max(n // 2 - alice_count, 0)
remaining_bob = max(n // 2 - bob_count, 0)

for i in range(min(len(neutral_supporters), remaining_alice)):
    total_influence += neutral_supporters[i]
    alice_count += 1

for i in range(min(len(neutral_supporters), remaining_bob)):
    total_influence += neutral_supporters[i]
    bob_count += 1

for i in range(min(len(both_supporters), remaining_alice, remaining_bob)):
    total_influence += both_supporters[i]
    alice_count += 1
    bob_count += 1

if alice_count >= n/2 and bob_count >= n/2:
    print(total_influence)
else:
    print(0)
```

The bugs are fixed and the code should now produce correct results.
