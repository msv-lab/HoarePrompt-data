I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Robbers, who attacked the Gerda's cab, are very successful in covering from the kingdom police. To make the goal of catching them even harder, they use their own watches.

First, as they know that kingdom police is bad at math, robbers use the positional numeral system with base 7. Second, they divide one day in n hours, and each hour in m minutes. Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to n - 1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to m - 1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation.

Note that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place.

Little robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, given in the decimal notation, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) — the number of hours in one day and the number of minutes in one hour, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer in decimal notation — the number of different pairs of hour and minute, such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3

Output
4

Input
8 2

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, possible pairs are: (0: 1), (0: 2), (1: 0), (1: 2).

In the second sample, possible pairs are: (02: 1), (03: 1), (04: 1), (05: 1), (06: 1).
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 3
" the output was "2
" but the expected output was "4
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

There are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.

1. The function `count_distinct_digits(num)` is not correctly counting the distinct digits. It is currently adding the digits of the number to a set, but it is not checking if the digit is already in the set before adding it. This is causing the count to be incorrect.

2. The condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` in the `count_distinct_times` function is not correctly checking if all the digits are distinct. It is currently checking if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the number, which is incorrect.

3. The condition in the if statement is checking if both the count of distinct digits in the hour and the count of distinct digits in the minute is equal to the length of the respective numbers. This means that if either the hour or the minute has repeated digits, it will not be counted. However, the requirement is that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Therefore, the condition should be changed to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number minus 1.

### BUGS
#### Bug 1
The function `count_distinct_digits(num)` is not correctly counting the distinct digits.

#### Code Location
The function `count_distinct_digits(num)` starting from line 4.

#### Bug 2
The condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` in the `count_distinct_times` function is not correctly checking if all the digits are distinct.

#### Code Location
The function `count_distinct_times(n, m)` starting from line 10.

#### Bug 3
The condition in the if statement is checking if both the count of distinct digits in the hour and the count of distinct digits in the minute is equal to the length of the respective numbers.

#### Code Location
The condition in the if statement in the `count_distinct_times(n, m)` function starting from line 13.

### IMPACT
Bug 1: The incorrect counting of distinct digits will result in an inaccurate count.

Bug 2: The incorrect checking of the distinct digits will not include pairs where the digits are not all distinct.

Bug 3: Pairs where the hour or minute has repeated digits will not be counted.

### SUGGESTED FIXES
To fix Bug 1, the function `count_distinct_digits(num)` should check if the digit is already in the set before adding it.

To fix Bug 2, the condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` should be changed to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number minus 1.

To fix Bug 3, the condition in the if statement should be modified to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number.

Apologies for the incomplete response. Here is the updated code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

def count_distinct_digits(num):
    digits = set()
    while num > 0:
        digit = num % 10
        num //= 10
        if digit in digits:
            return False
        digits.add(digit)
    return True

def count_distinct_times(n, m):
    count = 0
    for hour in range(n):
        for minute in range(m):
            if count_distinct_digits(hour) and count_distinct_digits(minute):
                count += 1
    return count

result = count_distinct_times(n, m)
print(result)
```

The code should now correctly count the distinct digit pairs for hours and minutes.
