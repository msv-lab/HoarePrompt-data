The function `count_distinct_digits(num)` is not correctly counting the distinct digits. It is currently adding the digits of the number to a set, but it is not checking if the digit is already in the set before adding it. This is causing the count to be incorrect.\n\n2. The condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` in the `count_distinct_times` function is not correctly checking if all the digits are distinct. It is currently checking if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the number, which is incorrect.\n\n3. The condition in the if statement is checking if both the count of distinct digits in the hour and the count of distinct digits in the minute is equal to the length of the respective numbers. This means that if either the hour or the minute has repeated digits, it will not be counted. However, the requirement is that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Therefore, the condition should be changed to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number minus 1.\n\n### BUGS\n#### Bug 1\nThe function `count_distinct_digits(num)` is not correctly counting the distinct digits.\n\n#### Code Location\nThe function `count_distinct_digits(num)` starting from line 4.\n\n#### Bug 2\nThe condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` in the `count_distinct_times` function is not correctly checking if all the digits are distinct.\n\n#### Code Location\nThe function `count_distinct_times(n, m)` starting from line 10.\n\n#### Bug 3\nThe condition in the if statement is checking if both the count of distinct digits in the hour and the count of distinct digits in the minute is equal to the length of the respective numbers.\n\n#### Code Location\nThe condition in the if statement in the `count_distinct_times(n, m)` function starting from line 13.\n\n### IMPACT\nBug 1: The incorrect counting of distinct digits will result in an inaccurate count.\n\nBug 2: The incorrect checking of the distinct digits will not include pairs where the digits are not all distinct.\n\nBug 3: Pairs where the hour or minute has repeated digits will not be counted.\n\n### SUGGESTED FIXES\nTo fix Bug 1, the function `count_distinct_digits(num)` should check if the digit is already in the set before adding it.\n\nTo fix Bug 2, the condition `if count_distinct_digits(hour) == len(str(hour)) and count_distinct_digits(minute) == len(str(minute))` should be changed to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number minus 1.\n\nTo fix Bug 3, the condition in the if statement should be modified to check if the count of distinct digits is equal to the length of the respective number.",
