          "feedback": "The code you provided has some bugs that are causing incorrect output. Let's analyze it in detail.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem and the expected logic.\n\nProblem: Given a sequence of characters representing people entering and leaving a club, we need to find the minimum number of distinct people that could have been seen.\n\nExpected logic:\n- Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of people inside the club at a given time.\n- Initialize a variable `distinct_people` to keep track of the maximum number of distinct people seen.\n- Iterate over each character in the sequence:\n    - If the character is \"+\", increment `count`.\n    - If the character is \"-\", decrement `count`.\n    - Keep track of the maximum value of `count` in `distinct_people`.\n- Print the `distinct_people` as the minimum number of distinct people observed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the issues in the given code:\n\n1. The loop variable `char` is not correctly updated when a person leaves the club. This is causing incorrect count calculations.\n2. The `distinct_people` variable is not initialized with the maximum value of `count` at the beginning.\n3. There is no check to handle the case when `count` becomes negative, which violates the assumption that all events happened consecutively.\n\nTo fix these issues, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\ns = input()\ncount = 0\ndistinct_people = 0\n\nfor char in s:\n    if char == \"+\":\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        count -= 1\n    distinct_people = max(distinct_people, count)\n    if count < 0:\n        count = 0\n\nprint(distinct_people)\n```\n\nWith these modifications, the code will correctly calculate the minimum number of distinct people observed.",
