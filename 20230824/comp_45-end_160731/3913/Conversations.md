I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Polycarpus takes part in the "Field of Wonders" TV show. The participants of the show have to guess a hidden word as fast as possible. Initially all the letters of the word are hidden.

The game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters. For example, if the hidden word is "abacaba" and the player tells the letter "a", the host will reveal letters at all positions, occupied by "a": 1, 3, 5 and 7 (positions are numbered from left to right starting from 1).

Polycarpus knows m words of exactly the same length as the hidden word. The hidden word is also known to him and appears as one of these m words.

At current moment a number of turns have already been made and some letters (possibly zero) of the hidden word are already revealed. Previously Polycarp has told exactly the letters which are currently revealed.

It is Polycarpus' turn. He wants to tell a letter in such a way, that the TV show host will assuredly reveal at least one more letter. Polycarpus cannot tell the letters, which are already revealed.

Your task is to help Polycarpus and find out the number of letters he can tell so that the show host will assuredly reveal at least one of the remaining letters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the hidden word.

The following line describes already revealed letters. It contains the string of length n, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and symbols "*". If there is a letter at some position, then this letter was already revealed. If the position contains symbol "*", then the letter at this position has not been revealed yet. It is guaranteed, that at least one letter is still closed.

The third line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — the number of words of length n, which Polycarpus knows. The following m lines contain the words themselves — n-letter strings of lowercase Latin letters. All words are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the hidden word appears as one of the given m words. Before the current move Polycarp has told exactly the letters which are currently revealed.


-----Output-----

Output the single integer — the number of letters Polycarpus can tell so that the TV show host definitely reveals at least one more letter. It is possible that this number is zero.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
a**d
2
abcd
acbd

Output
2

Input
5
lo*er
2
lover
loser

Output
0

Input
3
a*a
2
aaa
aba

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarpus can tell letters "b" and "c", which assuredly will be revealed.

The second example contains no letters which can be told as it is not clear, which of the letters "v" or "s" is located at the third position of the hidden word.

In the third example Polycarpus exactly knows that the hidden word is "aba", because in case it was "aaa", then the second letter "a" would have already been revealed in one of previous turns.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code seems to have a couple of bugs. I'll go through the code and identify the issues and their impact on the program's functionality.

1. In the function `count_possible_letters`, the loop should iterate `n` times, but it is iterating `m` times. It should be changed from `for i in range(m):` to `for i in range(n):` on line 2.

2. The condition `if revealed_letters[i] == '*':` checks whether the revealed letter at position `i` is equal to '*'. However, in the given inputs, the revealed letters are represented by '*'. So, the condition should be reversed to `if revealed_letters[i] != '*':` on line 2.

3. Inside the inner loop, the variable `revealed` is initialized as an empty set. However, instead of adding the revealed letters to this set, the code is adding the letters from all words at position `i` to the set. This is incorrect. The inner loop should iterate through all the words and check if the letter at position `i` in each word is not equal to the revealed letter at position `i`. If it is not equal, then it should be added to the `revealed` set. This can be fixed by replacing `revealed.add(word[i])` with `revealed.add(word[i]) if word[i] != revealed_letters[i] else None` on line 5.

4. The condition `if len(revealed) > 1:` checks if there is more than one unique letter at position `i` in the words. However, the task requires us to find the number of letters that Polycarpus can tell in order to definitely reveal at least one more letter. So, this condition should be changed to `if len(revealed) == 1:` on line 6.

5. The variable `possible` is incremented inside the loop whenever the condition `len(revealed) == 1` is satisfied. This means that it counts the number of positions where only one unique letter is found in the words. However, the task requires us to find the number of letters that Polycarpus can tell, not the number of positions. So, instead of incrementing `possible`, I will add the unique revealed letter at position `i` to a set called `unique_letters`. Then, I will return the length of the `unique_letters` set as the result. This can be done by changing `possible += 1` to `unique_letters.add(revealed.pop())` on line 7, and returning `len(unique_letters)` at the end of the function.

6. In the main code, the input for the number of turns `n` is missing. This should be added before the line `revealed_letters = input()`.
  
After making these changes, the code should output the correct result.
