I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
SIHanatsuka - EMber SIHanatsuka - ATONEMENT

Back in time, the seven-year-old Nora used to play lots of games with her creation ROBO_Head-02, both to have fun and enhance his abilities.

One day, Nora's adoptive father, Phoenix Wyle, brought Nora $n$ boxes of toys. Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.

She labelled all $n$ boxes with $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:

  Pick three distinct indices $i$, $j$ and $k$, such that $a_i \mid a_j$ and $a_i \mid a_k$. In other words, $a_i$ divides both $a_j$ and $a_k$, that is $a_j \bmod a_i = 0$, $a_k \bmod a_i = 0$.  After choosing, Nora will give the $k$-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.  After doing so, the box $k$ becomes unavailable for any further actions. 

Being amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.

Since ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?

As the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 60$), denoting the number of boxes.

The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 60$), where $a_i$ is the label of the $i$-th box.


-----Output-----

Print the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $10^9 + 7$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
2 6 8

Output
2

Input
5
2 3 4 9 12

Output

Input

5 7 2 9

Output
1



-----Note-----

Let's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $b$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position.

In the first example, there are $2$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [6]$ ($[2, \mathbf{6}, 8] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$)  $b = [8]$ ($[2, 6, \mathbf{8}] \xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$) 

In the second example, there are $4$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [9, 12]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$)  $b = [4, 12]$ ($[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$)  $b = [4, 9]$ ($[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  $b = [9, 4]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$) 

In the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all. Therefore, there is only $1$ valid pile, and that pile is empty.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
2 6 8
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the code:

- **Bug 1**: The code is not correctly checking if a box can be added to any existing pile. The condition `if box % topmost_box == 0` is incorrect because it checks if the box is divisible by the topmost box of the pile, when it should be checking if the topmost box is divisible by the box. The correct condition should be `if topmost_box % box == 0`.

- **Bug 2**: The code is not correctly counting the number of distinct piles. It is calculating the total number of piles by summing the lengths of all piles, which does not take into account the fact that some piles may have the same boxes. To count the number of distinct piles, the code should use a set to keep track of the distinct piles, and then return the size of the set.

- **Bug 3**: The code is not correctly initializing the `num_piles` variable. It should be initialized to 1 instead of 0, because there is always at least one pile (the empty pile).

- **Bug 4**: The code is not correctly initializing the `piles` list. It should be initialized with a list containing an empty pile `piles = [[]]` instead of an empty list `piles = []`, because there is always at least one pile (the empty pile).

- **Bug 5**: The code is not correctly calculating the result modulo 10^9 + 7. It is calculating the sum of the lengths of all piles modulo 10^9 + 7, instead of calculating each length modulo 10^9 + 7 and then summing them. The correct calculation should be `result = sum(len(pile) % mod for pile in piles) % mod`.

Now let's go through the code and fix these bugs one by one.
