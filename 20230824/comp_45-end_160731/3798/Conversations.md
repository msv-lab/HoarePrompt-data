I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
For integers b (b \geq 2) and n (n \geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows:
 - f(b,n) = n, when n < b
 - f(b,n) = f(b,\,{\rm floor}(n / b)) + (n \ {\rm mod} \ b), when n \geq b
Here, {\rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b,
and n \ {\rm mod} \ b denotes the remainder of n divided by b.
Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b.
For example, the following hold:
 - f(10,\,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30
 - f(100,\,87654)=8+76+54=138
You are given integers n and s.
Determine if there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s.
If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq n \leq 10^{11}
 - 1 \leq s \leq 10^{11}
 - n,\,s are integers.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
s

-----Output-----
If there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s, print the smallest such b.
If such b does not exist, print -1 instead.

-----Sample Input-----
87654
30

-----Sample Output-----
10

### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

The code you provided has a recursion error and does not produce the correct output for the given input. Let's analyze the bugs in detail:

1. Recursion Error:
   - The function `base_sum()` is a recursive function that calculates the sum of the digits of `n` in base `b`.
   - The function uses recursion to repeatedly call itself with `n // b` until `n < b`.
   - However, there is no base case to stop the recursion when `n < b`. This leads to the maximum recursion depth being exceeded and causes a RecursionError.
   - To fix this, add a base case to return `n` when `n < b`:

   ```python
   def base_sum(b, n):
       if n < b:
           return n
       return base_sum(b, n // b) + (n % b)
   ```

2. Incorrect loop range:
   - The code uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `b` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.
   - This loop is meant to check if there exists an integer `b` such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`.
   - However, the range of the loop is incorrect. It should be `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 2)` instead of `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`. 
   - The extra +1 is needed to include the upper bound in the loop range.

   ```python
   for b in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 2):
       if base_sum(b, n) == s:
           print(b)
           break
   ```

3. Incorrect variable calculation:
   - The code uses a second loop to iterate through possible values of `p` from the square root of `n` down to 1.
   - Inside this loop, a variable `b` is calculated as `(n - s) // p + 1`.
   - However, this calculation does not produce the correct value for `b`. Instead, it should be `b = (n - s) // p + p + 1`.

   ```python
   for p in range(int(n ** 0.5), 0, -1):
       b = (n - s) // p + p + 1
       if base_sum(b, n) == s:
           print(b)
           break
   ```

4. Incorrect output when no `b` exists:
   - If no value of `b` is found such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`, the code should output -1 according to the problem's description.
   - However, the code does not handle this case correctly. Instead of printing -1, it simply continues with the next iteration of the loop.
   - To fix this, add an `else` block after the second loop to print -1 if the loop completes without finding a valid `b`.

   ```python
   for p in range(int(n ** 0.5), 0, -1):
       b = (n - s) // p + p + 1
       if base_sum(b, n) == s:
           print(b)
           break
   else:
       print(-1)
   ```

5. Incorrect output when `n == s`:
   - The code checks if `n == s` and if true, it prints `n + 1`. However, this is not correct according to the problem's description.
   - The code should print -1 in this case because there exists no `b` such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`.
   - To fix this, change the print statement to `print(-1)`.

   ```python
   if n == s:
       print(-1)
   ```

After making these corrections, the code should produce the expected results.

I hope this helps you in fixing your code. Let me know if you have any further questions.
