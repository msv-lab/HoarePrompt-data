          "feedback": "### Review\n\nThe code you provided has a recursion error and does not produce the correct output for the given input. Let's analyze the bugs in detail:\n\n1. Recursion Error:\n   - The function `base_sum()` is a recursive function that calculates the sum of the digits of `n` in base `b`.\n   - The function uses recursion to repeatedly call itself with `n // b` until `n < b`.\n   - However, there is no base case to stop the recursion when `n < b`. This leads to the maximum recursion depth being exceeded and causes a RecursionError.\n   - To fix this, add a base case to return `n` when `n < b`:\n\n   ```python\n   def base_sum(b, n):\n       if n < b:\n           return n\n       return base_sum(b, n // b) + (n % b)\n   ```\n\n2. Incorrect loop range:\n   - The code uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `b` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.\n   - This loop is meant to check if there exists an integer `b` such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`.\n   - However, the range of the loop is incorrect. It should be `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 2)` instead of `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`. \n   - The extra +1 is needed to include the upper bound in the loop range.\n\n   ```python\n   for b in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 2):\n       if base_sum(b, n) == s:\n           print(b)\n           break\n   ```\n\n3. Incorrect variable calculation:\n   - The code uses a second loop to iterate through possible values of `p` from the square root of `n` down to 1.\n   - Inside this loop, a variable `b` is calculated as `(n - s) // p + 1`.\n   - However, this calculation does not produce the correct value for `b`. Instead, it should be `b = (n - s) // p + p + 1`.\n\n   ```python\n   for p in range(int(n ** 0.5), 0, -1):\n       b = (n - s) // p + p + 1\n       if base_sum(b, n) == s:\n           print(b)\n           break\n   ```\n\n4. Incorrect output when no `b` exists:\n   - If no value of `b` is found such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`, the code should output -1 according to the problem's description.\n   - However, the code does not handle this case correctly. Instead of printing -1, it simply continues with the next iteration of the loop.\n   - To fix this, add an `else` block after the second loop to print -1 if the loop completes without finding a valid `b`.\n\n   ```python\n   for p in range(int(n ** 0.5), 0, -1):\n       b = (n - s) // p + p + 1\n       if base_sum(b, n) == s:\n           print(b)\n           break\n   else:\n       print(-1)\n   ```\n\n5. Incorrect output when `n == s`:\n   - The code checks if `n == s` and if true, it prints `n + 1`. However, this is not correct according to the problem's description.\n   - The code should print -1 in this case because there exists no `b` such that `base_sum(b, n) == s`.\n   - To fix this, change the print statement to `print(-1)`.\n\n   ```python\n   if n == s:\n       print(-1)\n   ```\n\nAfter making these corrections, the code should produce the expected results.\n\nI hope this helps you in fixing your code. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
