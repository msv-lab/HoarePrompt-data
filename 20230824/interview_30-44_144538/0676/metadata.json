I will go through each part of the code and identify the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.\n\n1. Reading the input\n   - The code correctly reads the value of `n`, which represents the number of remaining boxes.\n   - Then, the code reads `n` lines and appends the values to the `candies` list.\n   - There doesn't seem to be any bug in this part.\n\n2. Sorting the candies\n   - After reading the candies, the code sorts the `candies` list in ascending order.\n   - There is no bug in this part.\n\n3. Handling the different cases based on the number of remaining boxes (`n`)\n   - The code correctly handles the cases when `n` is 0, 1, 2, and 4.\n   - However, there is a bug in the case when `n` is 3.\n     - The code compares `b >= c` and `a >= b`, but it should compare `c <= d` and `a <= b`. This is because `c` represents the second smallest number, and `d` represents the largest number.\n     - This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists, and will result in incorrect output.\n     - Additionally, there is a bug in calculating the median. Instead of `(a + c) // 2`, it should be `(b + c) // 2`.\n\n4. Checking if a solution exists\n   - The code correctly checks various conditions to determine if a solution exists.\n   - However, there is a bug in checking the condition `mean != median or median != range_val` for `n = 4`.\n     - The condition should be `mean != median or mean != range_val`.\n     - This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.\n\n5. Printing the output\n   - The code prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" depending on whether a solution exists or not.\n   - For cases when a solution exists, the code prints the missing numbers correctly.\n\nBased on my analysis, there are three bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.\n\n### BUGS\n\n1. Bug in the case when `n` is 3:\n   - The code compares `b >= c` and `a >= b` instead of `c <= d` and `a <= b`.\n   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.\n\n2. Bug in the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 3:\n   - The code calculates the median as `(a + c) // 2` instead of `(b + c) // 2`.\n   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.\n\n3. Bug in the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 4:\n   - The code checks the condition as `mean != median or median != range_val` instead of `mean != median or mean != range_val`.\n   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.\n\n### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS\n\n1. Update the comparison in the case when `n` is 3:\n   - In line 35, replace `(b >= c or a >= b)` with `(c <= d and a <= b)` to correctly compare the second smallest number and the largest number with the first and second smallest numbers, respectively.\n\n2. Update the calculation of the median in the case when `n` is 3:\n   - In line 39, replace `(a + c) // 2` with `(b + c) // 2` to correctly calculate the median.\n\n3. Update the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 4:\n   - In line 48, replace `(mean != median or median != range_val)` with `(mean != median or mean != range_val)` to correctly compare the mean, median, and range values.\n\n4. There are no other bugs or improvements needed in the code.\n\nI hope this review helps you in identifying the bugs and improving the code. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
