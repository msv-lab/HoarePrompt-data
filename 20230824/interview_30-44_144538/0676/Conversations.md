I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
There is an old tradition of keeping 4 boxes of candies in the house in Cyberland. The numbers of candies are special if their arithmetic mean, their median and their range are all equal. By definition, for a set {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} (x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ x_3 ≤ x_4) arithmetic mean is $\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}}{4}$, median is $\frac{x_{2} + x_{3}}{2}$ and range is x_4 - x_1. The arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer. It is well-known that if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a "debugging field" and codes in the field will have no bugs.

For example, 1, 1, 3, 3 is the example of 4 numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and range are all equal to 2.

Jeff has 4 special boxes of candies. However, something bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now there are only n (0 ≤ n ≤ 4) boxes remaining. The i-th remaining box contains a_{i} candies.

Now Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number of candies of the 4 - n missing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean, median and range are equal)?


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains an only integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 4).

The next n lines contain integers a_{i}, denoting the number of candies in the i-th box (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 500).


-----Output-----

In the first output line, print "YES" if a solution exists, or print "NO" if there is no solution.

If a solution exists, you should output 4 - n more lines, each line containing an integer b, denoting the number of candies in a missing box.

All your numbers b must satisfy inequality 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that if there exists a positive integer solution, you can always find such b's meeting the condition. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

Given numbers a_{i} may follow in any order in the input, not necessary in non-decreasing.

a_{i} may have stood at any positions in the original set, not necessary on lowest n first positions.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1
1

Output
YES
3
3

Input
3
1
1
1

Output
NO

Input
4
1
2
2
3

Output
YES



-----Note-----

For the first sample, the numbers of candies in 4 boxes can be 1, 1, 3, 3. The arithmetic mean, the median and the range of them are all 2.

For the second sample, it's impossible to find the missing number of candies.

In the third example no box has been lost and numbers satisfy the condition.

You may output b in any order.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The code provided has several bugs that are causing incorrect output. I will go through each part of the code and identify the bugs and their impact on the program's functionality.

1. Reading the input
   - The code correctly reads the value of `n`, which represents the number of remaining boxes.
   - Then, the code reads `n` lines and appends the values to the `candies` list.
   - There doesn't seem to be any bug in this part.

2. Sorting the candies
   - After reading the candies, the code sorts the `candies` list in ascending order.
   - There is no bug in this part.

3. Handling the different cases based on the number of remaining boxes (`n`)
   - The code correctly handles the cases when `n` is 0, 1, 2, and 4.
   - However, there is a bug in the case when `n` is 3.
     - The code compares `b >= c` and `a >= b`, but it should compare `c <= d` and `a <= b`. This is because `c` represents the second smallest number, and `d` represents the largest number.
     - This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists, and will result in incorrect output.
     - Additionally, there is a bug in calculating the median. Instead of `(a + c) // 2`, it should be `(b + c) // 2`.

4. Checking if a solution exists
   - The code correctly checks various conditions to determine if a solution exists.
   - However, there is a bug in checking the condition `mean != median or median != range_val` for `n = 4`.
     - The condition should be `mean != median or mean != range_val`.
     - This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.

5. Printing the output
   - The code prints "YES" or "NO" depending on whether a solution exists or not.
   - For cases when a solution exists, the code prints the missing numbers correctly.

Based on my analysis, there are three bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.

### BUGS

1. Bug in the case when `n` is 3:
   - The code compares `b >= c` and `a >= b` instead of `c <= d` and `a <= b`.
   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.

2. Bug in the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 3:
   - The code calculates the median as `(a + c) // 2` instead of `(b + c) // 2`.
   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.

3. Bug in the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 4:
   - The code checks the condition as `mean != median or median != range_val` instead of `mean != median or mean != range_val`.
   - Impact: This bug affects the condition for checking if a solution exists and will result in incorrect output.

### SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Update the comparison in the case when `n` is 3:
   - In line 35, replace `(b >= c or a >= b)` with `(c <= d and a <= b)` to correctly compare the second smallest number and the largest number with the first and second smallest numbers, respectively.

2. Update the calculation of the median in the case when `n` is 3:
   - In line 39, replace `(a + c) // 2` with `(b + c) // 2` to correctly calculate the median.

3. Update the condition for checking if a solution exists when `n` is 4:
   - In line 48, replace `(mean != median or median != range_val)` with `(mean != median or mean != range_val)` to correctly compare the mean, median, and range values.

4. There are no other bugs or improvements needed in the code.

I hope this review helps you in identifying the bugs and improving the code. Let me know if you have any further questions.

else:
    print("NO")
```

I have made the necessary changes in the code to fix the bugs and improve its functionality. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
