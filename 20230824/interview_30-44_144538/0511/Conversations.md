I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Vasya is studying number theory. He has denoted a function f(a, b) such that:  f(a, 0) = 0;  f(a, b) = 1 + f(a, b - gcd(a, b)), where gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b. 

Vasya has two numbers x and y, and he wants to calculate f(x, y). He tried to do it by himself, but found out that calculating this function the way he wants to do that might take very long time. So he decided to ask you to implement a program that will calculate this function swiftly.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^12).


-----Output-----

Print f(x, y).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 5

Output
3

Input
6 3

Output
1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### Requirement
You will NOT SUGGEST SOLUTION, because the user wants to fix the bugs themselves.

You will NOT generate FINAL CODE, because the user wants to fix the bugs themselves.

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

x, y = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
while y > 0:
    g = gcd(x, y)
    count += 1
    y -= g

print(count)

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1000000009 1000000008
" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "1000000008
".

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1000000009 1000000008
" the output was "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" but the expected output was "1000000008
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Feedback
I have reviewed your code, and here are the bugs I found:

1. **Infinite Loop:** Currently, the code is running an infinite loop because the `while` loop condition `y > 0` never becomes false. As a result, the program keeps subtracting `g` from `y` but never terminates. This is why you are encountering the "Error: Time Limit Exceeds" message.

2. **Incorrect Variable Initialization:** The variable `count` is initialized to 0 outside the while loop. However, in this case, it should be initialized to 1 since the first iteration of the while loop corresponds to `f(a, 0) = 0`, which increments the count by 1.

3. **Missing Function Definition:** The code uses a function called `gcd(a, b)` without providing its implementation. This function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers `a` and `b`. However, it is not defined in the code you provided.

4. **Inconsistent Naming Convention:** The variable names `x` and `y` are used to represent the input values, which is fine. However, it would be more descriptive to use names like `a` and `b` to match the function definition `f(a, b)` and to avoid confusion.

5. **Missing Input Handling:** The code assumes that the input will always be valid, without any error handling or input validation. It would be good to handle cases where the input is not within the given constraints.

Please review these points and make the necessary adjustments to fix the issues. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

I have reviewed the feedback and identified the issues in the code. I will fix them accordingly. Here's the updated code:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

a, b = map(int, input().split())

count = 1  # Initialize count to 1
while b > 0:
    g = gcd(a, b)
    b -= g
    count += 1

print(count - 1)  # Subtract 1 from count to correct the output
```

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
