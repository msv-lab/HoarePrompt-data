I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him a very difficult task.

Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers ($1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots$), and the second set consists of even positive numbers ($2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots$). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage — the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage — the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth — the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one, and also changes the set from which these numbers are written out to another. 

The ten first written numbers: $1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10$. Let's number the numbers written, starting with one.

The task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from $l$ to $r$ for given integers $l$ and $r$. The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by $1000000007$ ($10^9+7$).

Nazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}$) — the range in which you need to find the sum.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the answer modulo $1000000007$ ($10^9+7$).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
7
Input
5 14

Output
105
Input
88005553535 99999999999

Output
761141116


-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is the sum of the first three numbers written out ($1 + 2 + 4 = 7$).

In the second example, the numbers with numbers from $5$ to $14$: $5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18$. Their sum is $105$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

    return sum % 1000000007


# Read input values
l, r = map(int, input().split())

print(get_sum(l, r))
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1 3
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "7".

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "1 3
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "7".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. The code does not correctly handle the pattern in which the numbers are written out. According to the problem statement, at each stage, the teacher writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one and changes the set from which these numbers are written out. However, the current implementation simply checks whether the number is odd or even to determine if it should be added to the sum.

2. The code starts the loop at `l` and ends at `r+1`, which is incorrect. The loop should start at the position indicated by `l` and end at the position indicated by `r`.
