According to the problem statement, at each stage, the teacher writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one and changes the set from which these numbers are written out. However, the current implementation simply checks whether the number is odd or even to determine if it should be added to the sum.\n\n2. The code starts the loop at `l` and ends at `r+1`, which is incorrect. The loop should start at the position indicated by `l` and end at the position indicated by `r`.",
