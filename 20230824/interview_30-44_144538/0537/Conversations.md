I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There are n students who have taken part in an olympiad. Now it's time to award the students.

Some of them will receive diplomas, some wiil get certificates, and others won't receive anything. Students with diplomas and certificates are called winners. But there are some rules of counting the number of diplomas and certificates. The number of certificates must be exactly k times greater than the number of diplomas. The number of winners must not be greater than half of the number of all students (i.e. not be greater than half of n). It's possible that there are no winners.

You have to identify the maximum possible number of winners, according to these rules. Also for this case you have to calculate the number of students with diplomas, the number of students with certificates and the number of students who are not winners.


-----Input-----

The first (and the only) line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^12), where n is the number of students and k is the ratio between the number of certificates and the number of diplomas.


-----Output-----

Output three numbers: the number of students with diplomas, the number of students with certificates and the number of students who are not winners in case when the number of winners is maximum possible.

It's possible that there are no winners.


-----Examples-----
Input
18 2

Output
3 6 9

Input
9 10

Output
0 0 9

Input
1000000000000 5

Output
83333333333 416666666665 500000000002

Input
1000000000000 499999999999

Output
1 499999999999 500000000000
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "18 2
" the output was "4 8 6
" but the expected output was "3 6 9
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

The given code has a few bugs that need to be addressed:

#### 1. Incorrect calculation of the maximum number of winners
The code calculates the maximum number of winners as `min(n // 2, n // (2 * k))`. However, this calculation is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the number of winners cannot exceed half of the total number of students, but the number of certificates must be exactly k times greater than the number of diplomas. 

To fix this, we need to calculate the maximum number of diplomas based on the given constraints. The maximum number of diplomas can be calculated as `n // (k + 1)`. Since the number of certificates should be k times greater than diplomas, the maximum number of certificates can be calculated as `k * (n // (k + 1))`. 

#### 2. Incorrect calculation of the number of students who are not winners
The code calculates the number of students who are not winners as `n - diplomas - certificates`. However, this is incorrect. According to the problem statement, winners are defined as students with diplomas and certificates. Therefore, the correct calculation should be `n - (diplomas + certificates)`.

#### 3. Possible division by zero error
The code does not handle the possibility of k being equal to 0. If k is 0, it would result in a division by zero error. 

To fix this, we can add a check before calculating the maximum number of diplomas and certificates, and return a different output when k is 0.

#### 4. Input parsing and output formatting
The code does not implement any error handling for parsing input and the output is not formatted correctly. 

For input parsing, it would be good to handle any errors that might occur when converting input to integers.

For output formatting, the code can use `str.format()` method to format the output correctly.

### MODIFIED CODE
```python
def calculate_winners(n, k):
    if k == 0: # handle division by zero
        return 0, 0, n

    max_diplomas = n // (k + 1)
    max_certificates = k * max_diplomas
    non_winners = n - (max_diplomas + max_certificates)

    return max_diplomas, max_certificates, non_winners

# Input parsing
try:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    diplomas, certificates, non_winners = calculate_winners(n, k)
    # Output formatting
    print("{} {} {}".format(diplomas, certificates, non_winners))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
```
