          "feedback": "### REVIEW\n- The code seems to be using a while loop with a condition `j not in visited`, which suggests that it is trying to prevent an infinite loop.\n- The variables `N, K, P, C, max_score` are properly defined.\n- The code iterates through each square and calculates the score for starting at that square.\n- However, there are some bugs in the code that need to be addressed.\n\n### BUGS\n1. The condition `curr_score >= K` is incorrect for stopping the iteration.\n2. The calculation for `max_score` is placed in the wrong position, causing it to be updated in each iteration of the while loop instead of after the loop has finished.\n3. The final score will never be higher than the maximum score encountered in any starting square, so there is no need to check the condition `curr_score >= K` inside the while loop. This condition should be placed outside the while loop.\n4. There is a discrepancy between the sample input and the actual input. The sample input states that the second line contains `P_1 P_2 ... P_N`, but the actual input splits the line based on spaces. The second line should be split based on spaces to match the actual input.\n\n### CORRECTED CODE\n```python\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nP = list(map(int, input().split()))\nC = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_score = float('-inf')\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    curr_score = 0\n    visited = set()\n    j = i\n    while j not in visited:\n        curr_score += C[j]\n        visited.add(j)\n        j = P[j] - 1\n    \n    max_score = max(max_score, curr_score)\n\n# Check if the maximum possible score is less than K\nif max_score < K:\n    # Repeat the process until the maximum score is obtained\n    repeats = (K - max_score) // max_score\n    max_score += repeats * max_score\n\nprint(max_score)\n```\n\n### IMPACT\n1. The incorrect condition for stopping the iteration `curr_score >= K` causes the loop to stop prematurely and could result in an incorrect maximum score being calculated.\n2. The incorrect placement of `max_score = max(max_score, curr_score)` inside the while loop causes the maximum score to be updated in each iteration, resulting in a wrong maximum score being calculated.\n3. The unnecessary check `curr_score >= K` inside the while loop does not affect the functionality of the program, but it can cause an incorrect maximum score to be calculated if the condition is met before completing the full cycle.\n4. The discrepancy in the input handling may cause parsing errors and prevent the correct input from being read, resulting in incorrect calculations.",
