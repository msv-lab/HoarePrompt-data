I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Takahashi will play a game using a piece on an array of squares numbered 1, 2, \cdots, N. Square i has an integer C_i written on it. Also, he is given a permutation of 1, 2, \cdots, N: P_1, P_2, \cdots, P_N.
Now, he will choose one square and place the piece on that square. Then, he will make the following move some number of times between 1 and K (inclusive):
 - In one move, if the piece is now on Square i (1 \leq i \leq N), move it to Square P_i. Here, his score increases by C_{P_i}.
Help him by finding the maximum possible score at the end of the game. (The score is 0 at the beginning of the game.)

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 5000
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq P_i \leq N
 - P_i \neq i
 - P_1, P_2, \cdots, P_N are all different.
 - -10^9 \leq C_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
P_1 P_2 \cdots P_N
C_1 C_2 \cdots C_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible score at the end of the game.

-----Sample Input-----
5 2
2 4 5 1 3
3 4 -10 -8 8

-----Sample Output-----
8

When we start at some square of our choice and make at most two moves, we have the following options:
 - If we start at Square 1, making one move sends the piece to Square 2, after which the score is 4. Making another move sends the piece to Square 4, after which the score is 4 + (-8) = -4.
 - If we start at Square 2, making one move sends the piece to Square 4, after which the score is -8. Making another move sends the piece to Square 1, after which the score is -8 + 3 = -5.
 - If we start at Square 3, making one move sends the piece to Square 5, after which the score is 8. Making another move sends the piece to Square 3, after which the score is 8 + (-10) = -2.
 - If we start at Square 4, making one move sends the piece to Square 1, after which the score is 3. Making another move sends the piece to Square 2, after which the score is 3 + 4 = 7.
 - If we start at Square 5, making one move sends the piece to Square 3, after which the score is -10. Making another move sends the piece to Square 5, after which the score is -10 + 8 = -2.
The maximum score achieved is 8.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Requirement

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
N, K = map(int, input().split())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_score = float('-inf')

for i in range(N):

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 3
2 1
10 -7
" the output was "10
" but the expected output was "13
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW
- The code seems to be using a while loop with a condition `j not in visited`, which suggests that it is trying to prevent an infinite loop.
- The variables `N, K, P, C, max_score` are properly defined.
- The code iterates through each square and calculates the score for starting at that square.
- However, there are some bugs in the code that need to be addressed.

### BUGS
1. The condition `curr_score >= K` is incorrect for stopping the iteration.
2. The calculation for `max_score` is placed in the wrong position, causing it to be updated in each iteration of the while loop instead of after the loop has finished.
3. The final score will never be higher than the maximum score encountered in any starting square, so there is no need to check the condition `curr_score >= K` inside the while loop. This condition should be placed outside the while loop.
4. There is a discrepancy between the sample input and the actual input. The sample input states that the second line contains `P_1 P_2 ... P_N`, but the actual input splits the line based on spaces. The second line should be split based on spaces to match the actual input.

### CORRECTED CODE
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_score = float('-inf')

for i in range(N):
    curr_score = 0
    visited = set()
    j = i
    while j not in visited:
        curr_score += C[j]
        visited.add(j)
        j = P[j] - 1
    
    max_score = max(max_score, curr_score)

# Check if the maximum possible score is less than K
if max_score < K:
    # Repeat the process until the maximum score is obtained
    repeats = (K - max_score) // max_score
    max_score += repeats * max_score

print(max_score)
```

### IMPACT
1. The incorrect condition for stopping the iteration `curr_score >= K` causes the loop to stop prematurely and could result in an incorrect maximum score being calculated.
2. The incorrect placement of `max_score = max(max_score, curr_score)` inside the while loop causes the maximum score to be updated in each iteration, resulting in a wrong maximum score being calculated.
3. The unnecessary check `curr_score >= K` inside the while loop does not affect the functionality of the program, but it can cause an incorrect maximum score to be calculated if the condition is met before completing the full cycle.
4. The discrepancy in the input handling may cause parsing errors and prevent the correct input from being read, resulting in incorrect calculations.
