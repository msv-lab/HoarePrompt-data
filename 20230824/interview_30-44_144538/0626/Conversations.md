I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Robot Doc is located in the hall, with n computers stand in a line, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Each computer contains exactly one piece of information, each of which Doc wants to get eventually. The computers are equipped with a security system, so to crack the i-th of them, the robot needs to collect at least a_{i} any pieces of information from the other computers. Doc can hack the computer only if he is right next to it.

The robot is assembled using modern technologies and can move along the line of computers in either of the two possible directions, but the change of direction requires a large amount of resources from Doc. Tell the minimum number of changes of direction, which the robot will have to make to collect all n parts of information if initially it is next to computer with number 1.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one sequence of the robot's actions, which leads to the collection of all information. Initially Doc doesn't have any pieces of information.


-----Input-----

The first line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < n), separated by a space. It is guaranteed that there exists a way for robot to collect all pieces of the information.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the minimum number of changes in direction that the robot will have to make in order to collect all n parts of information.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 2 0

Output
1

Input
5
4 2 3 0 1

Output
3

Input
7
0 3 1 0 5 2 6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample you can assemble all the pieces of information in the optimal manner by assembling first the piece of information in the first computer, then in the third one, then change direction and move to the second one, and then, having 2 pieces of information, collect the last piece.

In the second sample to collect all the pieces of information in the optimal manner, Doc can go to the fourth computer and get the piece of information, then go to the fifth computer with one piece and get another one, then go to the second computer in the same manner, then to the third one and finally, to the first one. Changes of direction will take place before moving from the fifth to the second computer, then from the second to the third computer, then from the third to the first computer.

In the third sample the optimal order of collecting parts from computers can look like that: 1->3->4->6->2->5->7.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "Traceback (most recent call last):

    if a[current_computer] > 0:
IndexError: list index out of range
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code has a few bugs that need to be addressed.

#### 1. Incorrect Check for Direction Change
In the code, there is a check to determine if a direction change is required. However, the check is flawed and does not cover all possible cases. The following lines of code are used to determine if a direction change is required:
```python
if current_computer == 0 and a[current_computer] > 0:
    direction_changes += 1
if current_computer == n - 1 and a[current_computer] > 0:
    direction_changes += 1
if current_computer < n - 1 and a[current_computer] == 0 and a[current_computer + 1] > 0:
    direction_changes += 1
if current_computer > 0 and a[current_computer] == 0 and a[current_computer - 1] > 0:
    direction_changes += 1
if current_computer == 0 or a[current_computer - 1] == 0:
    current_computer += 1
else:
    current_computer -= 1
```
The checks for `current_computer == 0` and `current_computer == n - 1` are supposed to handle the cases where the robot is at the first or last computer and needs to change direction. However, these checks are not sufficient as they do not account for when the robot has already collected all the information from a computer and needs to change direction.

#### 2. Incorrect Condition for Collecting Information
In the code, there is a condition to check if the current computer has information to be collected. However, the condition is flawed and does not accurately determine if there is information to be collected. The condition in question is:
```python
if a[current_computer] > 0:
    information_collected += 1
    a[current_computer] -= 1
```
The issue with this condition is that it does not consider the possibility that the robot may have already collected all the information from the current computer. This leads to errors when attempting to collect information that is not available.

#### 3. Index Out of Range Error
There is an `IndexError` occurring in the code when the current computer is at the first or last position and a direction change is required. This error happens because the code does not account for the possibility of the robot being at the first or last computer and attempting to change direction.

### BUGS
1. Inadequate checks for direction change
2. Incorrect condition for collecting information
3. Index out of range error

### IMPACT
These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The inadequate checks for direction change prevent the robot from changing direction when necessary, leading to incorrect output. The incorrect condition for collecting information leads to errors when attempting to collect information that is not available. The index out of range error causes the program to crash when a direction change is attempted at the first or last computer. Overall, these bugs prevent the program from correctly determining the minimum number of changes in direction needed to collect all pieces of information.

### SOLUTION
To fix the bugs in the code, I will address each issue one by one.

#### 1. Incorrect Check for Direction Change
To properly check for a direction change, we need to consider cases where the robot has already collected all the information from a computer and needs to change direction. We can modify the check for direction change as follows:
```python
if current_computer == 0 or a[current_computer - 1] == 0:
    direction_changes += 1
```
This change ensures that the robot will change direction whenever it is at the first computer or when it has already collected all the information from the previous computer.

#### 2. Incorrect Condition for Collecting Information
To correctly determine if there is information to be collected from the current computer, we need to check if the number of information pieces in the current computer is greater than 0. We can modify the condition as follows:
```python
if a[current_computer] > 0:
    information_collected += 1
    a[current_computer] -= 1
```
This change ensures that the robot will only collect information if there is still information available in the current computer.

#### 3. Index Out of Range Error
To prevent the index out of range error when attempting to change direction at the first or last computer, we need to add a condition to check if the robot is at the first or last computer and needs to change direction. We can modify the check for direction change as follows:
```python
if (current_computer == 0 or a[current_computer - 1] == 0) and current_computer != n - 1:
    direction_changes += 1
if (current_computer == n - 1 or a[current_computer + 1] == 0) and current_computer != 0:
    direction_changes += 1
```
These changes ensure that the program will only attempt to change direction when the robot is not at the first or last computer.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Read the input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize variables
direction_changes = 0
current_computer = 0
information_collected = 0

# Iterate through the computers
while information_collected < n:
    # If the current computer has information, collect it and update the count
    if a[current_computer] > 0:
        information_collected += 1
        a[current_computer] -= 1
    # Move to the next computer in the current direction
    if (current_computer == 0 or a[current_computer - 1] == 0) and current_computer != n - 1:
        direction_changes += 1
    if (current_computer == n - 1 or a[current_computer + 1] == 0) and current_computer != 0:
        direction_changes += 1
    if current_computer == 0 or a[current_computer - 1] == 0:
        current_computer += 1
    else:
        current_computer -= 1

# Print the result
print(direction_changes)
```

Now the code should correctly determine the minimum number of changes in direction needed to collect all the pieces of information.
