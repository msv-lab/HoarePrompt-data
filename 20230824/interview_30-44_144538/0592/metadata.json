          "feedback": "###  BUGS\n\nThere are a couple of bugs in the given code:\n\n1. The formula to calculate the maximum score is incorrect. \n   The code calculates the maximum score as (n - 1) ^ 2, but it should be (n - 1) * (n - 1).\n   \n2. The restriction for n = 2 is incorrect.  \n   The code checks if n == 2 and prints 0, but it should actually print 0 if n <= 2.\n   \n3. There is no need for the else statement.  \n   Since the code already handles the case where n = 2, there is no need for the else statement. \n   The maximum score can be calculated for any value of n greater than 2.\n   \n4. The input prompt is incorrect.  \n   The input prompt asks for a positive integer n, but the code does not handle the case where n is negative.\n   The code should handle the case where n is negative and consider its absolute value.\n   \n   \n### IMPACT\n\n1. The incorrect formula for calculating the maximum score will lead to incorrect results for all inputs except n = 3.\n   For example, for n = 4 the expected maximum score is 8, but the code will output 9.\n   This bug has a significant impact on the program's functionality as it provides incorrect results for the main task of finding the maximum score.\n\n2. The incorrect restriction for n = 2 will lead to incorrect results for the specific case of n = 2.\n   For example, for n = 2 the expected output is 0, but the code will output a non-zero value.\n   This bug has a minor impact on the program's functionality as it only affects a specific case.\n\n3. The unnecessary else statement does not have an impact on the program's functionality, but removing it will improve the code's readability and clarity.\n\n4. The incorrect input prompt does not impact the program's functionality, but providing accurate instructions is important for understanding the requirements and constraints of the problem.\n\n### SUGGESTED FIXES\n\nHere are the suggested fixes for each bug:\n\n1. Replace the formula for calculating the maximum score with (n - 1) * (n - 1):\n```\nprint((n - 1) * (n - 1))\n```\n\n2. Change the restriction for n = 2 to n <= 2:\n```\nif n <= 2:\n```\n\n3. Remove the else statement:\n```\nif n <= 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print((n - 1) * (n - 1))\n```\n\n4. Update the input prompt to handle negative values of n and consider its absolute value:\n```\nn = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer n greater or equal to 2: \"))\nn = abs(n)\n```",
