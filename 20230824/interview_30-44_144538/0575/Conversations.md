I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Alice and Bob are playing chess on a huge chessboard with dimensions $n \times n$. Alice has a single piece left — a queen, located at $(a_x, a_y)$, while Bob has only the king standing at $(b_x, b_y)$. Alice thinks that as her queen is dominating the chessboard, victory is hers. 

But Bob has made a devious plan to seize the victory for himself — he needs to march his king to $(c_x, c_y)$ in order to claim the victory for himself. As Alice is distracted by her sense of superiority, she no longer moves any pieces around, and it is only Bob who makes any turns.

Bob will win if he can move his king from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check. Remember that a king can move to any of the $8$ adjacent squares. A king is in check if it is on the same rank (i.e. row), file (i.e. column), or diagonal as the enemy queen. 

Find whether Bob can win or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 1000$) — the dimensions of the chessboard.

The second line contains two integers $a_x$ and $a_y$ ($1 \leq a_x, a_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of Alice's queen.

The third line contains two integers $b_x$ and $b_y$ ($1 \leq b_x, b_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of Bob's king.

The fourth line contains two integers $c_x$ and $c_y$ ($1 \leq c_x, c_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of the location that Bob wants to get to.

It is guaranteed that Bob's king is currently not in check and the target location is not in check either.

Furthermore, the king is not located on the same square as the queen (i.e. $a_x \neq b_x$ or $a_y \neq b_y$), and the target does coincide neither with the queen's position (i.e. $c_x \neq a_x$ or $c_y \neq a_y$) nor with the king's position (i.e. $c_x \neq b_x$ or $c_y \neq b_y$).


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if Bob can get from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check, otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
4 4
1 3
3 1

Output
YES

Input
8
4 4
2 3
1 6

Output
NO

Input
8
3 5
1 2
6 1

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the diagrams below, the squares controlled by the black queen are marked red, and the target square is marked blue.

In the first case, the king can move, for instance, via the squares $(2, 3)$ and $(3, 2)$. Note that the direct route through $(2, 2)$ goes through check.

 [Image] 

In the second case, the queen watches the fourth rank, and the king has no means of crossing it.

 [Image] 

In the third case, the queen watches the third file.

Bob will win if he can move his king from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check. Remember that a king can move to any of the $8$ adjacent squares. A king is in check if it is on the same rank (i.e. row), file (i.e. column), or diagonal as the enemy queen. 

Find whether Bob can win or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 1000$) — the dimensions of the chessboard.

The second line contains two integers $a_x$ and $a_y$ ($1 \leq a_x, a_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of Alice's queen.

The third line contains two integers $b_x$ and $b_y$ ($1 \leq b_x, b_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of Bob's king.

The fourth line contains two integers $c_x$ and $c_y$ ($1 \leq c_x, c_y \leq n$) — the coordinates of the location that Bob wants to get to.

It is guaranteed that Bob's king is currently not in check and the target location is not in check either.

Furthermore, the king is not located on the same square as the queen (i.e. $a_x \neq b_x$ or $a_y \neq b_y$), and the target does coincide neither with the queen's position (i.e. $c_x \neq a_x$ or $c_y \neq a_y$) nor with the king's position (i.e. $c_x \neq b_x$ or $c_y \neq b_y$).


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if Bob can get from $(b_x, b_y)$ to $(c_x, c_y)$ without ever getting in check, otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "8
4 4
2 3
1 6
" the output was "YES
" but the expected output was "NO
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The code incorrectly checks condition 1. It checks if the king and queen are on the same row, column, or diagonal, but it should check if they are on the same **diagonal** only. This bug causes the code to output "YES" when it should output "NO" in some cases.

2. The code incorrectly checks condition 2. It checks if the absolute difference between the coordinates of the king and queen is less than or equal to 1, but it should check if they are equal to 1. This bug causes the code to output "YES" when it should output "NO" in some cases.

3. The code does not handle the case when the queen is located on the same diagonal as the target location, but not on the same diagonal as the king. In this case, the king can move to the target location without getting in check. The code incorrectly outputs "NO" in this case.

4. The code does not handle the case when the king and queen are on the same diagonal, but the target location is not on that diagonal. In this case, the king cannot move to the target location without getting in check. The code incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case.

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS

Due to these bugs, the code produces incorrect outputs in some cases. It may incorrectly output "YES" when the king cannot reach the target location without getting in check, and vice versa.
