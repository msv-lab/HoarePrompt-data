I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none — in writing a composition.

As Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?

Let's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written n lines, the i-th line contains a_{i} characters (including spaces). If some line contains k characters, then this line overall contains (k + 1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (r, c), where r is the number of the line and c is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).

Vasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys "Up", "Down", "Right" and "Left". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (r, c), then Vasya pushed key: "Up": if the cursor was located in the first line (r = 1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number r - 1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r - 1; "Down": if the cursor was located in the last line (r = n), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number r + 1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r + 1; "Right": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (c < a_{r} + 1), then it moves to the right (to position c + 1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the "Right" key; "Left": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (c > 1), then it moves to the left (to position c - 1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the "Left" key.

You've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (r_1, c_1) to position (r_2, c_2).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of lines in the file. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5), separated by single spaces. The third line contains four integers r_1, c_1, r_2, c_2 (1 ≤ r_1, r_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_1 ≤ a_{r}_1 + 1, 1 ≤ c_2 ≤ a_{r}_2 + 1).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of times Vasya should push a key to move the cursor from position (r_1, c_1) to position (r_2, c_2).


-----Examples-----
Input

-----Note-----

In the first sample the editor contains four lines. Let's represent the cursor's possible positions in the line as numbers. Letter s represents the cursor's initial position, letter t represents the last one. Then all possible positions of the cursor in the text editor are described by the following table.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
2 1 6 4
3 4 4 2
" the output was "13
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
Let's start by understanding the logic of the code and the expected functionality.

The input is provided as:
- n: the number of lines in the file
- a: a list containing the number of characters in each line
- r1, c1: the initial cursor position
- r2, c2: the final cursor position

The goal is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to shift the cursor from position (r1, c1) to position (r2, c2).

Let's analyze the code to identify any bugs or issues.

Upon initial review, it appears that the code calculates the correct minimum number of moves required. However, there are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed.

### BUGS AND ISSUES

#### 1. Indexing Error
Line 14 calculates the total number of moves required by adding the number of characters in the initial line and the number of characters in the final line. However, the indexing of the line is incorrect.
```python
if r1 != r2:
    moves += a[r1 - 1] + a[r2 - 1]
```
The line should be indexed as `a[r1]` and `a[r2]`, not `a[r1 - 1]` and `a[r2 - 1]`. This is because the line number starts from 1, not 0.

#### 2. Inconsistent Indexing
The initial and final cursor positions are given as `c1` and `c2`, respectively. However, the indexing in the code is inconsistent. When calculating the number of moves required to reach the final column, it correctly uses the absolute difference between `c1` and `c2`. However, when initializing `moves` or calculating the total number of moves, it does not take into account the additional moves required to reach the final column. This results in an incorrect minimum number of moves.

### IMPACT ON FUNCTIONALITY

The bugs mentioned above have the following impact on the functionality of the program:

1. The indexing error in line 14 causes the code to use incorrect values for the number of characters in the initial and final lines. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the minimum number of moves required.
2. The inconsistent indexing causes the code to incorrectly calculate the total number of moves required and does not take into account the additional moves required to reach the final column. As a result, the minimum number of moves is underestimated.

### SUGGESTED FIXES

To fix the bugs and make the code work correctly, the following changes should be made:

1. Fix the indexing error in line 14 by changing `a[r1 - 1]` and `a[r2 - 1]` to `a[r1]` and `a[r2]`, respectively.
2. Update the calculation of the total number of moves to accurately consider the additional moves required to reach the final column. This can be done by adding `abs(c1 - c2)` to the calculation of `moves`.

With these changes, the code should produce the correct minimum number of moves required to shift the cursor from the initial position to the final position.

### CORRECTED PYTHON CODE

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Read the number of lines
n = int(input())

# Read the number of characters in each line
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Read the initial and final cursor positions
r1, c1, r2, c2 = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the minimum number of moves to reach the final position
moves = abs(r1 - r2)

# If the initial and final positions are in different lines, add the number
# of characters in the initial line and the number of characters in the final
# line to the minimum number of moves
if r1 != r2:
    moves += a[r1] + a[r2]

# Add the number of moves required to reach the final column from the initial
# column in the initial line
moves += abs(c1 - c2)

# Print the minimum number of moves
print(moves)
```

With these changes, the code should now correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to shift the cursor from the initial position to the final position.
