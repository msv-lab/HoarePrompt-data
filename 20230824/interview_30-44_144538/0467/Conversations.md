I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Let’s define a grid to be a set of tiles with 2 rows and 13 columns. Each tile has an English letter written in it. The letters don't have to be unique: there might be two or more tiles with the same letter written on them. Here is an example of a grid: ABCDEFGHIJKLM

NOPQRSTUVWXYZ 

We say that two tiles are adjacent if they share a side or a corner. In the example grid above, the tile with the letter 'A' is adjacent only to the tiles with letters 'B', 'N', and 'O'. A tile is not adjacent to itself.

A sequence of tiles is called a path if each tile in the sequence is adjacent to the tile which follows it (except for the last tile in the sequence, which of course has no successor). In this example, "ABC" is a path, and so is "KXWIHIJK". "MAB" is not a path because 'M' is not adjacent to 'A'. A single tile can be used more than once by a path (though the tile cannot occupy two consecutive places in the path because no tile is adjacent to itself).

You’re given a string s which consists of 27 upper-case English letters. Each English letter occurs at least once in s. Find a grid that contains a path whose tiles, viewed in the order that the path visits them, form the string s. If there’s no solution, print "Impossible" (without the quotes).


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains the string s, consisting of 27 upper-case English letters. Each English letter occurs at least once in s.


-----Output-----

Output two lines, each consisting of 13 upper-case English characters, representing the rows of the grid. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution print "Impossible".


-----Examples-----
Input
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSGTUVWXYZ

Output
YXWVUTGHIJKLM
ZABCDEFSRQPON

Input
BUVTYZFQSNRIWOXXGJLKACPEMDH

Output
Impossible
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
There are several bugs in the provided code:
1. The check for the string length is incorrect. It should check if the length is not equal to 26.
2. The placement of the first tile in the grid is incorrect. It should be placed in the top left corner, not the top right.
3. The logic for finding adjacent tiles is flawed. It should check all four adjacent positions, not just three.
4. The loop for finding a tile in the queue that is adjacent to the current position is incorrect. It should iterate over the remaining tiles in the queue, not just once.
5. The check for tiles remaining in the queue is incorrect. It should check if the length of the queue is not zero, not if the queue itself is not empty.
6. The conversion of the grid to strings is incorrect. It should join the rows with a newline character, not a space.

Let's go through each bug in detail and discuss their impact on the program's functionality.

**content**: 
````markdown
The first bug is in the line `if len(s) != 27:`. The code is checking if the length of the string `s` is not equal to 27. However, the problem statement clearly states that the string contains 27 unique letters. Therefore, the correct condition should be `if len(s) != 26:`. This bug has no impact on the program's functionality because the incorrect condition will never be satisfied. 

The second bug is in the line `grid[0][0] = queue.popleft()`. The code is placing the first tile in the top right corner of the grid instead of the top left corner. To fix this bug, we need to change the index of the column in this line to 0 instead of 12. The corrected line should be `grid[0][0] = queue.popleft()`. This bug has a significant impact on the program's functionality because it affects the placement of the first tile in the grid. 

The third bug is in the logic for finding adjacent tiles. The current logic only checks for three adjacent positions: the left adjacent tile, the top adjacent tile, and the top left adjacent tile. However, it fails to check the right adjacent tile. To fix this bug, we need to add a check for the right adjacent tile. The corrected logic for finding adjacent tiles should be as follows:

```python
# Check the left adjacent tile
if j > 0:
    adjacent_tiles.append(grid[i][j-1])

# Check the top adjacent tile
if i > 0:
    adjacent_tiles.append(grid[i-1][j])

# Check the top left adjacent tile
if i > 0 and j > 0:
    adjacent_tiles.append(grid[i-1][j-1])

# Check the right adjacent tile
if j < 12:
    adjacent_tiles.append(grid[i][j+1])
```

This bug has a significant impact on the program's functionality because it affects the determination of whether a tile in the queue is adjacent to the current position or not. 

The fourth bug is in the loop for finding a tile in the queue that is adjacent to the current position. The current loop only checks the first tile in the queue and breaks if it is adjacent. However, it fails to check the remaining tiles in the queue. To fix this bug, we need to change the loop from a `while` loop to a `for` loop that iterates over the remaining tiles in the queue. The corrected loop for finding an adjacent tile in the queue should be as follows:

```python
# Find a tile in the queue that is adjacent to the current position
for k in range(len(queue)):
    tile = queue[k]
    if tile in adjacent_tiles:
        grid[i][j] = tile
        queue.remove(tile)
        break
```

This bug has a significant impact on the program's functionality because it affects the placement of tiles in the grid. 

The fifth bug is in the check for tiles remaining in the queue. The current check `if queue:` checks if the queue itself is not empty. However, it should check if the length of the queue is not zero. To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `if len(queue) != 0:`. The corrected check for tiles remaining in the queue should be as follows:

```python
# Check if there are tiles remaining in the queue
if len(queue) != 0:
    return "Impossible"
```

This bug has a significant impact on the program's functionality because it affects the determination of whether all tiles in the queue have been placed in the grid or not. 

The sixth bug is in the conversion of the grid to strings. The current code joins the rows of the grid with a space character instead of a newline character. To fix this bug, we need to change the separator in the `join()` function to `'\n'` instead of `' '`. The corrected conversion of the grid to strings should be as follows:

```python
# Convert the grid to strings
rows = [''.join(row) for row in grid]

# Return the resulting grid as a string
return '\n'.join(rows)
```

This bug has no impact on the program's functionality, but it affects the format of the output. 

Now that we have identified and understood the bugs, let's implement the fixes in the code:
