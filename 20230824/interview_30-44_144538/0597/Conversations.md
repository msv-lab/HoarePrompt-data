I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Ari the monster is not an ordinary monster. She is the hidden identity of Super M, the Byteforces’ superhero. Byteforces is a country that consists of n cities, connected by n - 1 bidirectional roads. Every road connects exactly two distinct cities, and the whole road system is designed in a way that one is able to go from any city to any other city using only the given roads. There are m cities being attacked by humans. So Ari... we meant Super M have to immediately go to each of the cities being attacked to scare those bad humans. Super M can pass from one city to another only using the given roads. Moreover, passing through one road takes her exactly one kron - the time unit used in Byteforces.  [Image] 

However, Super M is not on Byteforces now - she is attending a training camp located in a nearby country Codeforces. Fortunately, there is a special device in Codeforces that allows her to instantly teleport from Codeforces to any city of Byteforces. The way back is too long, so for the purpose of this problem teleportation is used exactly once.

You are to help Super M, by calculating the city in which she should teleport at the beginning in order to end her job in the minimum time (measured in krons). Also, provide her with this time so she can plan her way back to Codeforces.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 123456) - the number of cities in Byteforces, and the number of cities being attacked respectively.

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the road system. Each line contains two city numbers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n) - the ends of the road i.

The last line contains m distinct integers - numbers of cities being attacked. These numbers are given in no particular order.


-----Output-----

First print the number of the city Super M should teleport to. If there are many possible optimal answers, print the one with the lowest city number.

Then print the minimum possible time needed to scare all humans in cities being attacked, measured in Krons.

Note that the correct answer is always unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
3 5
3 6
3 7
2 7

Output
2
3

Input
6 4
1 2
2 3
2 4
4 5
4 6
2 4 5 6

Output
2
4



-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are two possibilities to finish the Super M's job in 3 krons. They are:

$2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 7$ and $7 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$.

However, you should choose the first one as it starts in the city with the lower number.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "7 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
3 5
3 6
3 7
2 7
" the output was "2
2
" but the expected output was "2
3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
The code is attempting to solve the problem by performing a depth-first search (DFS) to find the city with the maximum number of attacked cities. However, there are several bugs present in the code that are causing incorrect output.

### BUG 1: Incorrect Adjacency List Construction
The code is constructing the adjacency list incorrectly. The index of the adjacency list should be the city number, but the code is using `n+1` as the size of the adjacency list instead of `n`. This results in an incorrect representation of the road system.

### BUG 2: Incorrect Depth-First Search Logic
The DFS logic is incorrect because it is not keeping track of the maximum number of attacked cities in each path. Currently, the code is returning the total count of attacked cities in each path instead of the maximum count.

### BUG 3: Missing Check for Parent Node
The code is not excluding the parent node from continuing the DFS, which can cause an infinite loop and incorrect results. The code should skip the parent node in the adjacency list.

### BUG 4: Incorrectly Returning Teleport City
The code is returning the last city in the attacked cities list with the maximum count, instead of the city with the lowest number. The code should keep track of the minimum teleport city found so far.

### BUG 5: Incorrect Count Calculation
The code is incrementing the count by 1 for each node that is in the attacked cities list, even if that node is not directly connected to the current node. The count should only be incremented if the attacked city is a direct neighbor of the current node.

### PLAN
To fix the bugs and improve the code, I will:
1. Fix the adjacency list construction by using `n` as the size of the list.
2. Modify the DFS logic to keep track of the maximum count correctly and skip the parent node in the adjacency list.
3. Keep track of the minimum teleport city found so far.
4. Only increment the count if the attacked city is a direct neighbor of the current node.

I apologize for the abrupt ending. Here is the continuation of the solution:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
roads = []
adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for _ in range(n-1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    roads.append((u, v))
    adj_list[u].append(v)
    adj_list[v].append(u)

attacked_cities = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_count = -1
teleport_city = n

def dfs(node, parent, attacked_cities):
    count = 0

    for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            count += dfs(neighbor, node, attacked_cities)
        
    if node in attacked_cities:
        count += 1

    return count

for city in attacked_cities:
    count = dfs(city, -1, attacked_cities)

    if count > max_count or (count == max_count and city < teleport_city):
        max_count = count
        teleport_city = city

print(teleport_city)
print(max_count)
```

This should address the bugs and generate the correct output based on the given input. Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
