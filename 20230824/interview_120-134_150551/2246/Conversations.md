I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There are n cities and n - 1 roads in the Seven Kingdoms, each road connects two cities and we can reach any city from any other by the roads.

Theon and Yara Greyjoy are on a horse in the first city, they are starting traveling through the roads. But the weather is foggy, so they can’t see where the horse brings them. When the horse reaches a city (including the first one), it goes to one of the cities connected to the current city. But it is a strange horse, it only goes to cities in which they weren't before. In each such city, the horse goes with equal probabilities and it stops when there are no such cities. 

Let the length of each road be 1. The journey starts in the city 1. What is the expected length (expected value of length) of their journey? You can read about expected (average) value by the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — number of cities.

Then n - 1 lines follow. The i-th line of these lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n, u_{i} ≠ v_{i}) — the cities connected by the i-th road.

It is guaranteed that one can reach any city from any other by the roads.


-----Output-----

Print a number — the expected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1.

Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
1 2
1 3
2 4

Output
1.500000000000000

Input
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
2 5

Output
2.000000000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample, their journey may end in cities 3 or 4 with equal probability. The distance to city 3 is 1 and to city 4 is 2, so the expected length is 1.5.

In the second sample, their journey may end in city 4 or 5. The distance to the both cities is 2, so the expected length is 2.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

1 2

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code above is intended to calculate the expected length of a journey through a graph. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph and calculate the expected length of the journey. However, there are several bugs in the code that are causing incorrect results.

1. The code is missing the definition of the `dfs` function. Currently, there is a call to the `dfs` function in the `find_expected_length` function, but the definition of the `dfs` function is missing.
2. In the `dfs` function, the condition `num_neighbours == 0` is checking if a city has no neighbors, but it should be checking if a city has no unvisited neighbors. The current implementation can prematurely terminate the DFS if a city has visited neighbors, but not all of its neighbors have been visited.
3. The `visited` set is not being properly managed in the `dfs` function. The set is being passed as an argument to the function, but it is not being updated correctly. It should be updated to include the current city before calling the `dfs` function recursively on each unvisited neighbor.
4. The calculation of the expected length is incorrect. The `expected_length` variable should be divided by `num_neighbours` to calculate the average expected length for each neighbor. Currently, it is not being divided, causing incorrect results.

### BUGS

1. Missing definition of the `dfs` function.
2. Incorrect condition `num_neighbours == 0` in the `dfs` function.
3. Incorrect management of the `visited` set in the `dfs` function.
4. Incorrect calculation of the expected length in the `dfs` function.

### IMPACT

These bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program.

1. The missing definition of the `dfs` function prevents the code from running.
2. The incorrect condition `num_neighbours == 0` can prematurely terminate the DFS, not exploring all unvisited neighbors of a city.
3. The incorrect management of the `visited` set can lead to incorrect results, as it doesn't properly track the visited cities.
4. The incorrect calculation of the expected length can lead to incorrect results, as it doesn't properly average the expected lengths for each neighbor.
