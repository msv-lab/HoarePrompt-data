I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
There are n cities in the country where the Old Peykan lives. These cities are located on a straight line, we'll denote them from left to right as c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}. The Old Peykan wants to travel from city c_1 to c_{n} using roads. There are (n - 1) one way roads, the i-th road goes from city c_{i} to city c_{i} + 1 and is d_{i} kilometers long.

The Old Peykan travels 1 kilometer in 1 hour and consumes 1 liter of fuel during this time.

Each city c_{i} (except for the last city c_{n}) has a supply of s_{i} liters of fuel which immediately transfers to the Old Peykan if it passes the city or stays in it. This supply refreshes instantly k hours after it transfers. The Old Peykan can stay in a city for a while and fill its fuel tank many times. 

Initially (at time zero) the Old Peykan is at city c_1 and s_1 liters of fuel is transferred to it's empty tank from c_1's supply. The Old Peykan's fuel tank capacity is unlimited. Old Peykan can not continue its travel if its tank is emptied strictly between two cities.

Find the minimum time the Old Peykan needs to reach city c_{n}.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The value m specifies the number of roads between cities which is equal to n - 1.

The next line contains m space-separated integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{m} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 1000) and the following line contains m space-separated integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

In the only line of the output print a single integer — the minimum time required for The Old Peykan to reach city c_{n} from city c_1.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6
1 2 5 2
2 3 3 4

Output
10

Input
2 3
5 6
5 5

Output
14



-----Note-----

In the second sample above, the Old Peykan stays in c_1 for 3 hours.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "772

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs in the code that need to be fixed in order to get the correct output. Let's go through each one of them:

1. The code reads the input values correctly and initializes the variables. No bug found here.

2. Inside the loop that iterates over the roads, there is a bug that calculates the remaining fuel incorrectly. The line `fuel -= d[i]` should be `fuel -= d[i] * k` since the Old Peykan travels 1 kilometer in 1 hour and consumes 1 liter of fuel during this time.

3. The condition `if fuel < 0` is incorrectly checking if the remaining fuel is negative. The correct condition should be `if fuel <= 0` because if the fuel is exactly 0, the Old Peykan cannot continue its travel.

4. The line `refuel = abs(fuel)` calculates the amount of fuel to refuel incorrectly. The correct calculation should be `refuel = abs(fuel) + 1` because the Old Peykan cannot continue its travel if its tank is emptied strictly between two cities.

5. The calculation of the waiting time to refuel `wait = (refuel // s[i]) * k` is incorrect. Since the supply refreshes instantly k hours after it transfers, the waiting time to refuel should be `(refuel // s[i] + 1) * k` because the Old Peykan needs to wait for the supply to refresh.

6. The line `fuel = refuel` updates the fuel variable incorrectly. The Old Peykan should have the remaining fuel after refueling, so the correct line should be `fuel = refuel % s[i]`.

7. The line `fuel += s[i]` incorrectly adds the fuel supply of the next city to the fuel tank. The Old Peykan should only add the fuel if it stays in the city, so the correct line should be `fuel += s[i] - (refuel % s[i])`.

8. The code correctly calculates the time required to reach the next city, but it does not consider the waiting time to refuel. The line `time += d[i]` should be `time += d[i] + wait` to include the waiting time in the total time.

9. The code correctly prints the minimum time required to reach the last city. No bug found here.

### BUG FIXES

To fix the bugs, the following changes need to be made to the code:

1. Inside the loop, change `fuel -= d[i]` to `fuel -= d[i] * k`.

2. Change `if fuel < 0` to `if fuel <= 0`.

3. Change `refuel = abs(fuel)` to `refuel = abs(fuel) + 1`.

4. Change `wait = (refuel // s[i]) * k` to `wait = (refuel // s[i] + 1) * k`.

5. Change `fuel = refuel` to `fuel = refuel % s[i]`.

6. Change `fuel += s[i]` to `fuel += s[i] - (refuel % s[i])`.

7. Change `time += d[i]` to `time += d[i] + wait`.
