I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Little Vlad is fond of popular computer game Bota-2. Recently, the developers announced the new add-on named Bota-3. Of course, Vlad immediately bought only to find out his computer is too old for the new game and needs to be updated.

There are n video cards in the shop, the power of the i-th video card is equal to integer value a_{i}. As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants to buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the cutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as the leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For this new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In order to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of the leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced.

Vlad has an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards. Help him determine which video cards he should buy such that after picking the leading video card and may be reducing some powers of others to make them work together he will get the maximum total value of video power.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of video cards in the shop.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 200 000) — powers of video cards.


-----Output-----

The only line of the output should contain one integer value — the maximum possible total power of video cards working together.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
3 2 15 9

Output
27

Input
4
8 2 2 7

Output
18



-----Note-----

In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards with powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the leading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the total power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards should be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26, that is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power of the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 = 28.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7 needs it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 18.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "4
3 2 15 9
" the output was "15
" but the expected output was "27
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are two bugs in the code that are causing incorrect output.

1. The first bug is in the for loop that is iterating over the powers of the video cards. The condition `if power % max_power == 0` checks if the power of the current video card is divisible by the max power, if it is divisible then it adds the power of the current video card to the total power and breaks out of the loop. But this condition only checks if the power of the current video card is divisible by the max power, it doesn't check if the power of any other video card is divisible by the power of the current video card. Thus, this condition is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

2. The second bug is in the initialization of the `total_power` variable. It is currently initialized to `max_power`, which is the maximum power from the list of video cards. However, this is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum power video card is always the leading one, which may not be the case. The leading video card can be any video card from the list. So, the initialization of `total_power` needs to be changed.

### BUG FIXES

1. To fix the first bug, we need to change the condition in the for loop to check if the power of any other video card is divisible by the power of the current video card. We can do this by iterating over all the video cards and checking if their powers are divisible by the power of the current video card. If we find such a video card, we add its power to the total power and break out of the loop. If no such video card is found, we continue to the next video card.

2. To fix the second bug, we need to initialize the `total_power` variable to 0 instead of `max_power`. This is because we don't know which video card will be the leading one, so we need to start with 0 power and add the power of the leading video card later.

### UPDATED CODE

```python
def max_video_power(n, powers):
    powers.sort(reverse=True)
    total_power = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        divisible = False
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if powers[j] % powers[i] == 0:
                total_power += powers[j]
                divisible = True
                break
        if not divisible:
            total_power += powers[i]
            
    return total_power

n = int(input())
powers = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = max_video_power(n, powers)
print(result)
```
