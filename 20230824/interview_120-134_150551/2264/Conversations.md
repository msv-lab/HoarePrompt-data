I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Your math teacher gave you the following problem:

There are $n$ segments on the $x$-axis, $[l_1; r_1], [l_2; r_2], \ldots, [l_n; r_n]$. The segment $[l; r]$ includes the bounds, i.e. it is a set of such $x$ that $l \le x \le r$. The length of the segment $[l; r]$ is equal to $r - l$.

Two segments $[a; b]$ and $[c; d]$ have a common point (intersect) if there exists $x$ that $a \leq x \leq b$ and $c \leq x \leq d$. For example, $[2; 5]$ and $[3; 10]$ have a common point, but $[5; 6]$ and $[1; 4]$ don't have.

You should add one segment, which has at least one common point with each of the given segments and as short as possible (i.e. has minimal length). The required segment can degenerate to be a point (i.e a segment with length zero). The added segment may or may not be among the given $n$ segments.

In other words, you need to find a segment $[a; b]$, such that $[a; b]$ and every $[l_i; r_i]$ have a common point for each $i$, and $b-a$ is minimal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{5}$) — the number of segments. The following $n$ lines contain segment descriptions: the $i$-th of them contains two integers $l_i,r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^{9}$).

The sum of all values $n$ over all the test cases in the input doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output one integer — the smallest possible length of the segment which has at least one common point with all given segments.


-----Example-----
Input
4
3
4 5
5 9
7 7
5
11 19
4 17
16 16
3 12
14 17
1
1 10
1
1 1

Output
2
4
0
0



-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example, we can choose the segment $[5;7]$ as the answer. It is the shortest segment that has at least one common point with all given segments.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

Looking at the code, I can identify the following bugs:

1. In the function `smallest_segment`, the value of `left` is calculated incorrectly. It should be the maximum value of the left bounds of the segments, but the code is currently calculating the maximum value of the right bounds.

2. Similarly, in the function `smallest_segment`, the value of `right` is calculated incorrectly. It should be the minimum value of the right bounds of the segments, but the code is currently calculating the minimum value of the left bounds.

3. The length calculation is incorrect. It should be `right - left` instead of `right - left + 1`. Adding 1 to the result will give a segment length that is one unit larger than necessary.

4. The initialization of the variable `result` should be done inside the loop, not outside. Currently, the code accumulates the lengths of segments in a single list for all test cases, resulting in incorrect output.

5. The code is missing input processing for the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The value should be read from input using the `int(input())` function.

6. The code is not correctly parsing the input for the segments. The inner loop that reads the segment coordinates is not properly formatted, resulting in incorrect segment values.

### BUG SUMMARY

1. Incorrect calculation of `left` variable.
2. Incorrect calculation of `right` variable.
3. Incorrect length calculation.
4. Incorrect initialization of `result` variable.
5. Missing input processing for `t` variable.
6. Incorrect parsing of segment coordinates.

These bugs occur in the following locations in the code:

1. `left = max([segment[0] for segment in segments])`
2. `right = min([segment[1] for segment in segments])`
3. `length = right - left + 1 if right >= left else 0`
4. `result = []`
5. `t = int(input())`
6. `for _ in range(n):`
