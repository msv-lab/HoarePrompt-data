I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out! II". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node.

Let's index all the nodes of the tree such that   The root is number 1  Each internal node i (i ≤ 2^{h} - 1 - 1) will have a left child with index = 2i and a right child with index = 2i + 1 

The level of a node is defined as 1 for a root, or 1 + level of parent of the node otherwise. The vertices of the level h are called leaves. The exit to the maze is located at some leaf node n, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out! 

In the new version of the game the player is allowed to ask questions on the format "Does the ancestor(exit, i) node number belong to the range [L, R]?". Here ancestor(v, i) is the ancestor of a node v that located in the level i. The game will answer with "Yes" or "No" only. The game is designed such that it doesn't always answer correctly, and sometimes it cheats to confuse the player!.

Amr asked a lot of questions and got confused by all these answers, so he asked you to help him. Given the questions and its answers, can you identify whether the game is telling contradictory information or not? If the information is not contradictory and the exit node can be determined uniquely, output its number. If the information is not contradictory, but the exit node isn't defined uniquely, output that the number of questions is not sufficient. Otherwise output that the information is contradictory.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers h, q (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 0 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the height of the tree and the number of questions respectively.

The next q lines will contain four integers each i, L, R, ans (1 ≤ i ≤ h, 2^{i} - 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 2^{i} - 1, $\text{ans} \in \{0,1 \}$), representing a question as described in the statement with its answer (ans = 1 if the answer is "Yes" and ans = 0 if the answer is "No").


-----Output-----

If the information provided by the game is contradictory output "Game cheated!" without the quotes.

Else if you can uniquely identify the exit to the maze output its index. 

Otherwise output "Data not sufficient!" without the quotes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 1
3 4 6 0

Output
7
Input
4 3
4 10 14 1
3 6 6 0
2 3 3 1

Output

Input

3 4 6 1
4 12 15 1

Output
Data not sufficient!
Input
4 2
3 4 5 1
2 3 3 1

Output
Game cheated!


-----Note-----

Node u is an ancestor of node v if and only if   u is the same node as v,  u is the parent of node v,  or u is an ancestor of the parent of node v. 

In the first sample test there are 4 leaf nodes 4, 5, 6, 7. The first question says that the node isn't in the range [4, 6] so the exit is node number 7.

In the second sample test there are 8 leaf nodes. After the first question the exit is in the range [10, 14]. After the second and the third questions only node number 14 is correct. Check the picture below to fully understand.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3 1
3 4 6 0
" the output was "Data not sufficient!
" but the expected output was "7".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ###  BUGS

#### BUG 1: Input Reading
The code reads the input incorrectly. The line `h, q = map(int, input().split())` tries to read the values of `h` and `q` from the standard input, but there is no input provided. This will lead to an error. 

#### BUG 2: Unpacking Error
The line `for i, L, R, ans in questions:` tries to unpack each question tuple into `i`, `L`, `R`, and `ans`, but the code does not iterate over the `questions` list correctly. It should be `for i, L, R, ans in questions:` instead of `for i, L, R, ans in enumerate(questions):`.

#### BUG 3: Incorrect Indexing
In the line `if ans == 0 and L <= possible_exit_nodes[0] and R >= possible_exit_nodes[-1]:`, the code checks if the answer is contradictory by comparing `L` with `possible_exit_nodes[0]` and `R` with `possible_exit_nodes[-1]`. However, the code is assuming that `possible_exit_nodes` is already sorted, which is not the case. 

#### BUG 4: Incorrect Node Range Comparison
The line `if (node < L or node > R and ans == 0):` checks if `node` is less than `L` or greater than `R` in the case of `ans` being 0. However, the condition should be `if (node < L or node > R) and ans == 0:` to correctly check both conditions.

#### BUG 5: Data Type Mismatch
The variable `new_possible_exit_nodes` is declared as a list, but on the line `new_possible_exit_nodes = []`, it is assigned an empty string. This will cause an error when trying to iterate over the list later in the code.

#### BUG 6: Missing Return Statement
Within the function `check_exit_node`, there is no return statement if the information is contradictory (i.e., if the conditions for a contradictory answer are met). The code should return "Game cheated!" in this case.

### IMPACT
The bugs presented above impact the functionality of the program as follows:

- **Bug 1**: The program will raise an error because it is trying to read inputs when no inputs are provided.

- **Bug 2**: The program will not correctly iterate over the questions, leading to incorrect unpacking of the tuples.

- **Bug 3**: The program will incorrectly determine if the answer is contradictory, as it assumes that the possible exit nodes are already sorted.

- **Bug 4**: The program will incorrectly update the list of possible exit nodes if the answer is 0 and the node is not within the given range.

- **Bug 5**: The program will raise an error when trying to append to `new_possible_exit_nodes` because it is an empty string instead of a list.

- **Bug 6**: The function `check_exit_node` will not return anything if the information is contradictory, leading to incorrect output.

### SUGGESTION
To fix these bugs and improve the functionality of the program, the following changes can be made:

1. Remove the lines that read input from the standard input (`h, q = map(int, input().split())` and the subsequent loop).

2. Change the for loop that iterates over the questions to correctly unpack the tuples: `for i, L, R, ans in questions:`.

3. Sort the `possible_exit_nodes` list before checking if the answer is contradictory in order to ensure correct comparisons.

4. Update the condition `if (node < L or node > R and ans == 0):` to `if (node < L or node > R) and ans == 0:` to correctly check both conditions.

5. Initialize `new_possible_exit_nodes` as an empty list: `new_possible_exit_nodes = []`.

6. Add a return statement that returns "Game cheated!" if the answer is contradictory: `return "Game cheated!"`.

With these changes, the code should function correctly and provide the expected output.
