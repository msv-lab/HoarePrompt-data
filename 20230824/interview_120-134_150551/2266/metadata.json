To do this, the program first determines the distance of each city from the nearest police station using a breadth-first search algorithm. Then, for each city, it checks if there exists a neighbor city such that the sum of the distances from the current city to the neighbor city and from the neighbor city to any police station is less than or equal to 2 * d. If such a neighbor city exists, the road between the current city and the neighbor city can be shut down.\n\nThe program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the distance of each city from the nearest police station. It starts with a queue containing the initial police stations and iteratively explores the neighbors of each city until the queue is empty. However, there are several bugs in the program that cause incorrect output.\n\n### 1. Incorrect Initialization of `visited` List\n\nThe program initializes the `visited` list to contain `n+1` elements, where `n` is the number of cities. However, the list should only have `n` elements since the cities are numbered from 1 to `n`. This bug does not affect the functionality of the program since the extra element is not used.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Initialization of `distances` List\n\nThe program initializes the `distances` list to contain `n+1` elements, where `n` is the number of cities. However, the distances should be initialized to infinity for cities that are not police stations. The bug occurs because the program sets the distances of police stations to 0 before initializing the queue for the breadth-first search. To fix this bug, the program should initialize the distances to infinity for all cities first, and then set the distances of police stations to 0.\n\n### 3. Incorrect Calculation of `max_distance`\n\nThe program calculates the `max_distance` as the maximum value in the `distances` list, excluding the distance of the first city. However, the program should consider the maximum distance among all cities, including the distance of the first city. To fix this bug, the program should modify the calculation of `max_distance` to include the distance of the first city (`distances[1]`).\n\n### 4. Incorrect Condition in the Neighbor City Search\n\nThe program checks if there exists a neighbor city such that the sum of the distances from the current city to the neighbor city and from the neighbor city to any police station is less than or equal to 2 * d. However, this condition is incorrect because it does not take into account the maximum distance to any police station (`max_distance`). To fix this bug, the program should modify the condition to check if the sum of the distances is less than or equal to `2 * d - max_distance`.\n\n### 5. Incorrect Printing of the Answer\n\nThe program prints the indices of the roads that can be shut down in an incorrect format. It prints each road twice, once in each direction, resulting in duplicate indices. To fix this bug, the program should print each road only once.\n\n### 6. Incorrect Output Format\n\nThe program does not follow the required output format. It should print the maximum number of roads that can be shut down on a separate line, followed by the indices of the roads on another line.\n\n### 7. Inefficient Solution\n\nThe program checks all pairs of cities to find the roads that can be shut down. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large inputs. However, finding a more efficient solution is beyond the scope of this code review.\n\n### BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTo fix the bugs and improve the program, the following changes need to be made:\n\n1. Initialize the `visited` list with `n` elements instead of `n+1`.\n2. Initialize the `distances` list with infinity for all cities, and set the distances of the police stations to 0.\n3. Calculate the `max_distance` as the maximum distance among all cities, including the distance of the first city.\n4. Modify the condition in the neighbor city search to check if the sum of the distances is less than or equal to `2 * d - max_distance`.\n5. Modify the printing of the answer to print each road only once.\n6. Follow the required output format by printing the maximum number of roads that can be shut down on a separate line, followed by the indices of the roads on another line.\n\nNote that improving the efficiency of the solution is beyond the scope of this code review.",
