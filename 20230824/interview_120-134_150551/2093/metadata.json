The program is currently checking if `episodes[i] == episodes[j]`, which is incorrect. \n\nTo fix this bug, we need to change the comparison condition to `episodes[i] == episodes[j] and i != j`. This condition makes sure that we count a pair only if we have both `season x episode y` and `season y episode x` and that `x` and `y` are different.\n\nOther than that, the program looks fine. It correctly reads the input and iterates over the episodes pairwise to check for matching seasons.",
