I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
One day Polycarp decided to rewatch his absolute favourite episode of well-known TV series "Tufurama". He was pretty surprised when he got results only for season 7 episode 3 with his search query of "Watch Tufurama season 3 episode 7 online full hd free". This got Polycarp confused — what if he decides to rewatch the entire series someday and won't be able to find the right episodes to watch? Polycarp now wants to count the number of times he will be forced to search for an episode using some different method.

TV series have n seasons (numbered 1 through n), the i-th season has a_{i} episodes (numbered 1 through a_{i}). Polycarp thinks that if for some pair of integers x and y (x < y) exist both season x episode y and season y episode x then one of these search queries will include the wrong results. Help Polycarp to calculate the number of such pairs!


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1  ≤ n  ≤  2·10^5) — the number of seasons.

The second line contains n integers separated by space a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — number of episodes in each season.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of pairs x and y (x < y) such that there exist both season x episode y and season y episode x.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
0

Input
3
8 12 7

Output
3

Input
3
3 2 1

Output
2



-----Note-----

Possible pairs in the second example:  x = 1, y = 2 (season 1 episode 2 [Image] season 2 episode 1);  x = 2, y = 3 (season 2 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 2);  x = 1, y = 3 (season 1 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 1). 

In the third example:  x = 1, y = 2 (season 1 episode 2 [Image] season 2 episode 1);  x = 1, y = 3 (season 1 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 1).
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3
8 12 7
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There is only one bug in the code. The issue is with the comparison condition in the inner loop. The program is currently checking if `episodes[i] == episodes[j]`, which is incorrect. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison condition to `episodes[i] == episodes[j] and i != j`. This condition makes sure that we count a pair only if we have both `season x episode y` and `season y episode x` and that `x` and `y` are different.

Other than that, the program looks fine. It correctly reads the input and iterates over the episodes pairwise to check for matching seasons.
