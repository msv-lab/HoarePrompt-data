I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence of $n$ pairs of integers: $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \dots , (a_n, b_n)$. This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]$ is bad because the sequence of first elements is sorted: $[1, 3, 3]$;  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 2)]$ is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted: $[2, 2, 2]$;  $s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]$ is bad because both sequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements) are sorted;  $s = [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2)]$ is good because neither the sequence of first elements $([1, 3, 2])$ nor the sequence of second elements $([3, 3, 2])$ is sorted. 

Calculate the number of permutations of size $n$ such that after applying this permutation to the sequence $s$ it turns into a good sequence. 

A permutation $p$ of size $n$ is a sequence $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$). If you apply permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ to the sequence $s_1, s_2, \dots , s_n$ you get the sequence $s_{p_1}, s_{p_2}, \dots , s_{p_n}$. For example, if $s = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]$ and $p = [2, 3, 1]$ then $s$ turns into $[(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)]$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$).

The next $n$ lines contains description of sequence $s$. The $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$) — the first and second elements of $i$-th pair in the sequence.

The sequence $s$ may contain equal elements.


-----Output-----

Print the number of permutations of size $n$ such that after applying this permutation to the sequence $s$ it turns into a good sequence. Print the answer modulo $998244353$ (a prime number).


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 1
2 2
3 1

Output
3

Input
4
2 3
2 2
2 1
2 4

Output
0

Input
3
1 1
1 1
2 3

Output
4



-----Note-----

In first test case there are six permutations of size $3$:   if $p = [1, 2, 3]$, then $s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by first elements);  if $p = [1, 3, 2]$, then $s = [(1, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by second elements);  if $p = [2, 1, 3]$, then $s = [(2, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1)]$ — good sequence;  if $p = [2, 3, 1]$, then $s = [(2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 1)]$ — good sequence;  if $p = [3, 1, 2]$, then $s = [(3, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by second elements);  if $p = [3, 2, 1]$, then $s = [(3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 1)]$ — good sequence.

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence of $n$ pairs of integers: $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \dots , (a_n, b_n)$. This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]$ is bad because the sequence of first elements is sorted: $[1, 3, 3]$;  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 2)]$ is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted: $[2, 2, 2]$;  $s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]$ is bad because both sequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements) are sorted;  $s = [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2)]$ is good because neither the sequence of first elements $([1, 3, 2])$ nor the sequence of second elements $([3, 3, 2])$ is sorted. 

Calculate the number of permutations of size $n$ such that after applying this permutation to the sequence $s$ it turns into a good sequence. 

A permutation $p$ of size $n$ is a sequence $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$). If you apply permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ to the sequence $s_1, s_2, \dots , s_n$ you get the sequence $s_{p_1}, s_{p_2}, \dots , s_{p_n}$. For example, if $s = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]$ and $p = [2, 3, 1]$ then $s$ turns into $[(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)]$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$).

The next $n$ lines contains description of sequence $s$. The $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$) — the first and second elements of $i$-th pair in the sequence.

The sequence $s$ may contain equal elements.


-----Output-----

Print the number of permutations of size $n$ such that after applying this permutation to the sequence $s$ it turns into a good sequence. Print the answer modulo $998244353$ (a prime number).

-----Note-----

In first test case there are six permutations of size $3$:   if $p = [1, 2, 3]$, then $s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by first elements);  if $p = [1, 3, 2]$, then $s = [(1, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by second elements);  if $p = [2, 1, 3]$, then $s = [(2, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1)]$ — good sequence;  if $p = [2, 3, 1]$, then $s = [(2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 1)]$ — good sequence;  if $p = [3, 1, 2]$, then $s = [(3, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)]$ — bad sequence (sorted by second elements);  if $p = [3, 2, 1]$, then $s = [(3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 1)]$ — good sequence.

### QUESTION
You are given a sequence of $n$ pairs of integers: $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \dots , (a_n, b_n)$. This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]$ is bad because the sequence of first elements is sorted: $[1, 3, 3]$;  $s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 2)]$ is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted: $[2, 2, 2]$;  $s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]$ is bad because both sequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements) are sorted;  $s = [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2)]$ is good because neither the sequence of first elements $([1, 3, 2])$ nor the sequence of second elements $([3, 3, 2])$ is sorted. 

Calculate the number of permutations of size $n$ such that after applying this permutation to the sequence $s$ it turns into a good sequence. 

A permutation $p$ of size $n$ is a sequence $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$). If you apply permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n$ to the sequence $s_1, s_2, \dots , s_n$ you get the sequence $s_{p_1}, s_{p_2}, \dots , s_{p_n}$. For example, if $s = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]$ and $p = [2, 3, 1]$ then $s$ turns into $[(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)]$.


-----Input-----

The next $n$ lines contains description of sequence $s$. The $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$) — the first and second elements of $i$-th pair in the sequence.

The sequence $s$ may contain equal elements.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs in the provided code. We will discuss them one by one and explain their impact on the program's functionality.

#### 1. Initializing frequencies
The frequency dictionaries `freq_1` and `freq_2` are initialized incorrectly. They should be initialized as empty dictionaries, not with curly braces. This will cause an error when trying to use the `.values()` function.

#### 2. Counting bad sequences
The code calculates the counts for bad sequences using a loop through the frequencies. However, this approach is incorrect. The frequency of each element should be considered when calculating the counts, not just the number of distinct elements. The current implementation multiplies the frequency by the previous total count, resulting in incorrect values.

#### 3. Calculating total permutations
The code uses the `pow()` function to calculate the total permutations. However, this function is not used correctly. The third argument should be the mod value, not the exponent value. The correct way to calculate the total permutations is to raise `n` to the power of `n` and then take the result modulo `998244353`.

#### 4. Calculating good permutations
The code calculates the number of good permutations by subtracting the counts of bad sequences from the total number of permutations. However, this calculation is incorrect. Since the total permutations and the counts of bad sequences are already taken modulo `998244353`, we need to take the subtraction modulo `998244353` as well. Additionally, the code subtracts the counts of bad sequences twice, resulting in an incorrect final answer.

### BUG FIXES

Here are the following fixes for the identified bugs:

#### 1. Initializing frequencies

Initialize `freq_1` and `freq_2` as empty dictionaries:

```python
freq_1 = {}
freq_2 = {}
```

#### 2. Counting bad sequences

Use the frequencies of each element to calculate the counts of bad sequences. Change the code in the loop that updates the frequencies as follows:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    freq_1[a] = freq_1.get(a, 0) + 1
    freq_2[b] = freq_2.get(b, 0) + 1
```

#### 3. Calculating total permutations

Calculate the total permutations by raising `n` to the power of `n` and taking the result modulo `998244353`:

```python
total_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)
```

#### 4. Calculating good permutations

Calculate the number of good permutations by subtracting the counts of bad sequences from the total number of permutations, taking the result modulo `998244353`:

```python
good_permutations = (total_permutations - count_1 - count_2 + 998244353) % 998244353
```

### UPDATED CODE

Here's the updated code with the bug fixes:

```python
# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Create two dictionaries to store the frequencies of each element for the first and second positions
freq_1 = {}
freq_2 = {}

# Iterate through the input and update the frequencies
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    freq_1[a] = freq_1.get(a, 0) + 1
    freq_2[b] = freq_2.get(b, 0) + 1

# Initialize the counts for bad sequences
count_1 = 1
count_2 = 1

# Iterate through the frequencies and calculate the counts for bad sequences
for freq in freq_1.values():
    count_1 *= freq
    count_1 %= 998244353

for freq in freq_2.values():
    count_2 *= freq
    count_2 %= 998244353

# Calculate the total number of permutations
total_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)

# Calculate the number of good permutations
good_permutations = (total_permutations - count_1 - count_2 + 998244353) % 998244353

# Print the result
print(good_permutations)
```

After applying these fixes, the code should produce the correct output for the given test case.

### ANALYSIS

There seem to be some confusion in the code posted. The code snippet that is given earlier does not seem to be related to the actual question. The code provided in the first response checks whether a given number `w` is even and prints "YES" if it is even, otherwise it prints "NO". However, that code does not address the question at all.

The given task is to calculate the number of permutations of size `n` such that after applying the permutation to the given sequence `s`, it turns into a good sequence. There are a few steps that need to be followed in order to correctly solve the problem:

1. Read the input values for `n` and the sequence `s` consisting of pairs of integers `(a, b)`.
2. Initialize counter variables `bad_sequences` and `total_permutations` as 0.
3. For each element in the sequence `s`, check if it violates the conditions for a good sequence. If it violates the first condition, increment `bad_sequences` by the frequency of the first element. If it violates the second condition, increment `bad_sequences` by the frequency of the second element.
4. Calculate the total number of permutations as `total_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)`.
5. Calculate the number of good permutations as `good_permutations = (total_permutations - bad_sequences + 998244353) % 998244353`.
6. Print the number of good permutations.

### UPDATED CODE

Here's the updated code based on the analysis:

```python
# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Create two dictionaries to store the frequencies of each element for the first and second positions
freq_1 = {}
freq_2 = {}

# Iterate through the input and update the frequencies
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    freq_1[a] = freq_1.get(a, 0) + 1
    freq_2[b] = freq_2.get(b, 0) + 1

# Initialize the counter for bad sequences
bad_sequences = 0

# Check for bad sequences and update the counter
for freq in freq_1.values():
    bad_sequences += freq * (freq - 1) // 2

for freq in freq_2.values():
    bad_sequences += freq * (freq - 1) // 2

# Calculate the total number of permutations
total_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)

# Calculate the number of good permutations
