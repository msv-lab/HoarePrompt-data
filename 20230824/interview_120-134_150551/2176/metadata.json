          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\n\nThere are multiple bugs in the provided code. We will discuss them one by one and explain their impact on the program's functionality.\n\n#### 1. Initializing frequencies\nThe frequency dictionaries `freq_1` and `freq_2` are initialized incorrectly. They should be initialized as empty dictionaries, not with curly braces. This will cause an error when trying to use the `.values()` function.\n\n#### 2. Counting bad sequences\nThe code calculates the counts for bad sequences using a loop through the frequencies. However, this approach is incorrect. The frequency of each element should be considered when calculating the counts, not just the number of distinct elements. The current implementation multiplies the frequency by the previous total count, resulting in incorrect values.\n\n#### 3. Calculating total permutations\nThe code uses the `pow()` function to calculate the total permutations. However, this function is not used correctly. The third argument should be the mod value, not the exponent value. The correct way to calculate the total permutations is to raise `n` to the power of `n` and then take the result modulo `998244353`.\n\n#### 4. Calculating good permutations\nThe code calculates the number of good permutations by subtracting the counts of bad sequences from the total number of permutations. However, this calculation is incorrect. Since the total permutations and the counts of bad sequences are already taken modulo `998244353`, we need to take the subtraction modulo `998244353` as well. Additionally, the code subtracts the counts of bad sequences twice, resulting in an incorrect final answer.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\nHere are the following fixes for the identified bugs:\n\n#### 1. Initializing frequencies\n\nInitialize `freq_1` and `freq_2` as empty dictionaries:\n\n```python\nfreq_1 = {}\nfreq_2 = {}\n```\n\n#### 2. Counting bad sequences\n\nUse the frequencies of each element to calculate the counts of bad sequences. Change the code in the loop that updates the frequencies as follows:\n\n```python\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    freq_1[a] = freq_1.get(a, 0) + 1\n    freq_2[b] = freq_2.get(b, 0) + 1\n```\n\n#### 3. Calculating total permutations\n\nCalculate the total permutations by raising `n` to the power of `n` and taking the result modulo `998244353`:\n\n```python\ntotal_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)\n```\n\n#### 4. Calculating good permutations\n\nCalculate the number of good permutations by subtracting the counts of bad sequences from the total number of permutations, taking the result modulo `998244353`:\n\n```python\ngood_permutations = (total_permutations - count_1 - count_2 + 998244353) % 998244353\n```\n\n### UPDATED CODE\n\nHere's the updated code with the bug fixes:\n\n```python\n# Read the input\nn = int(input())\n\n# Create two dictionaries to store the frequencies of each element for the first and second positions\nfreq_1 = {}\nfreq_2 = {}\n\n# Iterate through the input and update the frequencies\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    freq_1[a] = freq_1.get(a, 0) + 1\n    freq_2[b] = freq_2.get(b, 0) + 1\n\n# Initialize the counts for bad sequences\ncount_1 = 1\ncount_2 = 1\n\n# Iterate through the frequencies and calculate the counts for bad sequences\nfor freq in freq_1.values():\n    count_1 *= freq\n    count_1 %= 998244353\n\nfor freq in freq_2.values():\n    count_2 *= freq\n    count_2 %= 998244353\n\n# Calculate the total number of permutations\ntotal_permutations = pow(n, n, 998244353)\n\n# Calculate the number of good permutations\ngood_permutations = (total_permutations - count_1 - count_2 + 998244353) % 998244353\n\n# Print the result\nprint(good_permutations)\n```\n\nAfter applying these fixes, the code should produce the correct output for the given test case.",
