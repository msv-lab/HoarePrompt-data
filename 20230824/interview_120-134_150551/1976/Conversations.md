I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Recently Luba bought a monitor. Monitor is a rectangular matrix of size n × m. But then she started to notice that some pixels cease to work properly. Luba thinks that the monitor will become broken the first moment when it contains a square k × k consisting entirely of broken pixels. She knows that q pixels are already broken, and for each of them she knows the moment when it stopped working. Help Luba to determine when the monitor became broken (or tell that it's still not broken even after all q pixels stopped working).


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integer numbers n, m, k, q (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m), 0 ≤ q ≤ n·m) — the length and width of the monitor, the size of a rectangle such that the monitor is broken if there is a broken rectangle with this size, and the number of broken pixels.

Each of next q lines contain three integer numbers x_{i}, y_{i}, t_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ m, 0 ≤ t_{ ≤ 10}^9) — coordinates of i-th broken pixel (its row and column in matrix) and the moment it stopped working. Each pixel is listed at most once.

We consider that pixel is already broken at moment t_{i}.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the minimum moment the monitor became broken, or "-1" if it's still not broken after these q pixels stopped working.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 3 2 5
2 1 8
2 2 8
1 2 1
1 3 4
2 3 2

Output
8

Input
3 3 2 5
1 2 2
2 2 1
2 3 5
3 2 10
2 1 100

Output
-1
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "100

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS
Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

1. The code is reading the input incorrectly. The input format is "n m k q", but the code is reading it as "n, m, k, q". We need to remove the commas.

2. The code is not using the correct coordinates for the broken pixels. The input format is "x y t", but the code is using the coordinates as "x, y, t". We need to remove the commas.

3. The code is using the wrong condition to check if a pixel is inside the k x k square. The condition is `(i <= x <= i + k – 1 and j <= y <= j + k – 1)`, but it should be `(i <= x < i + k and j <= y < j + k)`.

4. The code is finding the maximum t value for each pixel inside the k x k square, but it should only find the maximum t value once for all the pixels inside the square. The line `min_broken_time = min(min_broken_time, max(t for _, _, t in broken_pixels))` should be moved outside the loop that checks for broken pixels.

5. The code is not correctly checking if the monitor is still not broken. The condition `min_broken_time == float('inf')` is incorrect. Instead, we should check if `min_broken_time` is still equal to `float('inf')` after the loop that checks for broken pixels.

6. The code is not correctly handling the case when there are no broken pixels. In this case, the code should output `-1`, but it doesn't.

### BUGS:
1. The code is reading the input incorrectly.
2. The code is using the wrong coordinates for the broken pixels.
3. The code is using the wrong condition to check if a pixel is inside the k x k square.
4. The code is finding the maximum t value for each pixel inside the k x k square instead of finding it once for all the pixels.
5. The code is not correctly checking if the monitor is still not broken.
6. The code is not correctly handling the case when there are no broken pixels.

### IMPACT:
1. The code is reading the input incorrectly, which may result in incorrect values for n, m, k, and q. This can lead to unexpected behavior and wrong results.
2. The code is using the wrong coordinates for the broken pixels, which can result in incorrect placement of the broken pixels.
3. The code is using the wrong condition to check if a pixel is inside the k x k square, which can result in incorrect detection of broken pixels inside the square.
4. The code is finding the maximum t value for each pixel inside the k x k square, which is incorrect. This can lead to wrong results for the minimum moment the monitor becomes broken.
5. The code is not correctly checking if the monitor is still not broken. This can lead to incorrect output when the monitor is still not broken.
6. The code is not correctly handling the case when there are no broken pixels, which can lead to incorrect output in this case.
