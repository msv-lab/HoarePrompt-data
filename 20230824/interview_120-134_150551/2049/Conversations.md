I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
You've got an array, consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Also, you've got m queries, the i-th query is described by two integers l_{i}, r_{i}. Numbers l_{i}, r_{i} define a subsegment of the original array, that is, the sequence of numbers a_{l}_{i}, a_{l}_{i} + 1, a_{l}_{i} + 2, ..., a_{r}_{i}. For each query you should check whether the corresponding segment is a ladder. 

A ladder is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k}, such that it first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. In other words, there is such integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ k), that the following inequation fulfills: b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_{x} ≥ b_{x} + 1 ≥ b_{x} + 2... ≥ b_{k}. Note that the non-decreasing and the non-increasing sequences are also considered ladders.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of array elements and the number of queries. The second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where number a_{i} stands for the i-th array element.

The following m lines contain the description of the queries. The i-th line contains the description of the i-th query, consisting of two integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) — the boundaries of the subsegment of the initial array.

The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

Print m lines, in the i-th line print word "Yes" (without the quotes), if the subsegment that corresponds to the i-th query is the ladder, or word "No" (without the quotes) otherwise. 


-----Examples-----
Input
8 6
1 2 1 3 3 5 2 1
1 3
2 3
2 4
8 8
1 4
5 8

Output
Yes
Yes
No
Yes
No
Yes
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### QUESTION
You've got an array, consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Also, you've got m queries, the i-th query is described by two integers l_{i}, r_{i}. Numbers l_{i}, r_{i} define a subsegment of the original array, that is, the sequence of numbers a_{l}_{i}, a_{l}_{i} + 1, a_{l}_{i} + 2, ..., a_{r}_{i}. For each query you should check whether the corresponding segment is a ladder. 

A ladder is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k}, such that it first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. In other words, there is such integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ k), that the following inequation fulfills: b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_{x} ≥ b_{x} + 1 ≥ b_{x} + 2... ≥ b_{k}. Note that the non-decreasing and the non-increasing sequences are also considered ladders.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of array elements and the number of queries. The second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where number a_{i} stands for the i-th array element.

The following m lines contain the description of the queries. The i-th line contains the description of the i-th query, consisting of two integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) — the boundaries of the subsegment of the initial array.

The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

Print m lines, in the i-th line print word "Yes" (without the quotes), if the subsegment that corresponds to the i-th query is the ladder, or word "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are several bugs in the code. Let's go through them one by one:

1. **Bug in line 10**: The code checks if the subsegment is non-decreasing by comparing it with the sorted subsegment. However, this logic is incorrect because a subsegment can be non-decreasing without being a ladder. For example, [1, 2, 3] is non-decreasing but not a ladder. We need to modify this logic to check for the presence of a "peak" in the subsegment.

2. **Bug in line 12**: The code checks if the subsegment is non-increasing by comparing it with the reverse sorted subsegment. Similar to the previous bug, this logic is incorrect because a subsegment can be non-increasing without being a ladder. We need to modify this logic to also check for the presence of a "peak" in the subsegment.

3. **Bug in the output**: The code prints "No" when the subsegment is not a ladder, but it should print "No" when the subsegment is a ladder. The output needs to be reversed.

### BUG FIXES

1. **Fix for bug in line 10**: To check if the subsegment is a ladder, we need to find the index of the maximum element in the subsegment. If the subsegment is a ladder, then the maximum element should be at the beginning or the end of the subsegment. We can iterate through the subsegment and check if the index of the maximum element is either 0 or the length of the subsegment minus 1.

2. **Fix for bug in line 12**: Similar to the previous bug fix, we need to find the index of the minimum element in the subsegment. If the subsegment is a ladder, then the minimum element should be at the beginning or the end of the subsegment. We can iterate through the subsegment and check if the index of the minimum element is either 0 or the length of the subsegment minus 1.

3. **Fix for the output**: Reverse the print statements for "Yes" and "No" to correctly indicate whether the subsegment is a ladder or not.

### CODE FIX

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for _ in range(m):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    subsegment = a[l-1:r]
    
    # Check if subsegment is a ladder
    maximum_index = subsegment.index(max(subsegment))
    minimum_index = subsegment.index(min(subsegment))
    if maximum_index == 0 or maximum_index == len(subsegment) - 1:
        print("Yes")
    elif minimum_index == 0 or minimum_index == len(subsegment) - 1:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

### BUG DISCUSSION AND IMPACT

1. **Bug in line 10**: The bug here is that the code is checking if the subsegment is non-decreasing instead of checking if it is a ladder. This bug affects the correctness of the program's output. The code will incorrectly classify some non-ladder subsegments as ladders, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Bug in line 12**: The bug here is also that the code is checking if the subsegment is non-increasing instead of checking if it is a ladder. This bug also affects the correctness of the program's output. The code will incorrectly classify some non-ladder subsegments as ladders, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Bug in the output**: The bug here is a reversal in the output of "Yes" and "No". This bug affects the correctness of the program's output. The code will incorrectly print "No" when the subsegment is a ladder, and "Yes" when it is not a ladder.

Overall, these bugs significantly impact the program's functionality. The program will produce incorrect results and misclassify subsegments as ladders or non-ladders.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's go through the bug fixes one by one.

1. **Fix for bug in line 10**:
   - The current code checks if `w` is odd or equal to 2 to determine if it is a prime number. However, this condition is incorrect.
   - We can fix this by implementing a prime number checking function.
   - We can iterate from 2 to the square root of `w` and check if any number divides `w` evenly.
   - If we find a number that divides `w` evenly, it means that `w` is not a prime number.
   - If we don't find any such number, it means `w` is a prime number.
   - Here's the fixed code:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

w = int(input())
if is_prime(w):
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
```

2. **Fix for bug in line 12**:
   - Since there is no line 12 in the code you provided, I assume there is no bug in that line.
   - If you meant to include another bug on line 12, please provide the correct code and the bug description so I can assist you further.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
