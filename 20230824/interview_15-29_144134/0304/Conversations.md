I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
This night wasn't easy on Vasya. His favorite team lost, and he didn't find himself victorious either — although he played perfectly, his teammates let him down every time. He had to win at least one more time, but the losestreak only grew longer and longer... It's no wonder he didn't get any sleep this night at all.

In the morning, Vasya was waiting the bus to the university on the bus stop. Vasya's thoughts were hazy and so he couldn't remember the right bus' number quite right and got onto the bus with the number $n$.

In the bus, Vasya thought that he could get the order of the digits in the number of the bus wrong. Futhermore, he could "see" some digits several times, but the digits he saw were definitely in the real number of the bus. For example, if Vasya saw the number 2028, it could mean that the real bus number could be 2028, 8022, 2820 or just 820. However, numbers 80, 22208, 52 definitely couldn't be the number of the bus. Also, real bus number couldn't start with the digit 0, this meaning that, for example, number 082 couldn't be the real bus number too.

Given $n$, determine the total number of possible bus number variants.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the number of the bus that was seen by Vasya. It is guaranteed that this number does not start with $0$.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the amount of possible variants of the real bus number.


-----Examples-----
Input
97

Output
2

Input
2028

Output
13



-----Note-----

In the first sample, only variants $97$ and $79$ are possible.

In the second sample, the variants (in the increasing order) are the following: $208$, $280$, $802$, $820$, $2028$, $2082$, $2208$, $2280$, $2802$, $2820$, $8022$, $8202$, $8220$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
n = input()
length = len(n) # length of the number
count = length - 1 # possible number of positions to swap
result = count * 2 # each position can have one of two digits
if length > 1:
    result += 1 # add 1 for the original number
print(result)
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "97

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "97
" the output was "3
" but the expected output was "2
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

The code calculates the number of possible variations of the bus number that Vasya could have seen given the number of the bus that was seen. However, there are a few bugs in the code that need to be fixed in order to get the correct output.

Let's go through each part of the code and identify the bugs:

1. Reading input: The code uses the `input()` function to read the number of the bus that was seen. However, it doesn't convert the input into an integer before processing it. This means that the number is treated as a string throughout the code. 

2. Length calculation: The code correctly calculates the length of the input number using the `len()` function and assigns it to the variable `length`.

3. Number of positions to swap: The code calculates the number of positions where the digits could be swapped by subtracting 1 from the length of the number and assigns it to the variable `count`.

4. Result calculation: The code multiplies the number of positions to swap by 2 to account for the two possible digits that can be placed in each position. However, this calculation doesn't take into account the possibility of having the same digit in all positions. Additionally, the code adds 1 to the result if the length of the number is greater than 1, but it doesn't handle the case where the number consists of repeated digits.

5. Output: The code prints the result.

To fix the bugs, we need to consider the following:

1. Convert the input to an integer before processing it.

2. Adjust the result calculation to handle the possibility of having the same digit in all positions.

3. Handle the case where the number consists of repeated digits.

Let's now update the code to fix these bugs.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
n = int(input())
length = len(str(n)) # length of the number
count = length - 1 # possible number of positions to swap

# check if all digits are the same
if len(set(str(n))) == 1:
    result = 1
elif length > 1:
    result = count * 2 + 1 # each position can have one of two digits, plus 1 for the original number
else:
    result = 1
