I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
A girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her.

Given an array $a$ of length $n$, consisting only of the numbers $0$ and $1$, and the number $k$. Exactly $k$ times the following happens:   Two numbers $i$ and $j$ are chosen equiprobable such that ($1 \leq i < j \leq n$).  The numbers in the $i$ and $j$ positions are swapped. 

Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the $a$ array will be sorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem.

It can be shown that the desired probability is either $0$ or it can be represented as $\dfrac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q \not\equiv 0~\pmod {10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$) — the length of the array $a$ and the number of operations.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the description of the array $a$.


-----Output-----

If the desired probability is $0$, print $0$, otherwise print the value $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ $\pmod {10^9+7}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are defined above.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
0 1 0

Output
333333336
Input
5 1
1 1 1 0 0

Output
0
Input
6 4
1 0 0 1 1 0

Output
968493834


-----Note-----

In the first example, all possible variants of the final array $a$, after applying exactly two operations: $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$. Therefore, the answer is $\dfrac{3}{9}=\dfrac{1}{3}$.

In the second example, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order after one operation, therefore the answer is $0$.

            ### CODE REVIEW

There are several issues with the given code:

1. The code incorrectly assumes that if `k` is odd, the desired probability is always 0. This is not true. In some cases, the array can still be sorted after an odd number of operations.

2. The code counts the number of zeros and ones in the array `a`, but it does not take into account the effect of the operations. The positions of the zeros and ones can change after each operation, so simply counting them at the beginning is not sufficient.

3. The code calculates the probability as `p * q_inv` without checking if either `p` or `q` is 0. This can lead to incorrect results. If `p` is 0, the probability should be 0. If `q` is 0, the probability is undefined.

4. The code uses the `math.factorial` function to calculate the value of `p` and `q`. However, calculating factorials for large numbers can lead to overflow and incorrect results. It would be better to use a different approach to calculate `p` and `q`.

5. The code uses modular exponentiation to calculate the modular inverse of `q` (i.e., `q_inv`). However, it uses the wrong modulus value (`10**9 + 5` instead of `10**9 + 7`). This will lead to incorrect results.

6. The code prints the result as an integer, but it should be printed as a modular inverse.

Let's go through these issues one by one and provide more details:

1. The code incorrectly assumes that if `k` is odd, the desired probability is always 0. This is not true. In some cases, the array can still be sorted after an odd number of operations.

In the case of the given example (`n = 3`, `k = 2`, `a = [0, 1, 0]`), the array can be sorted after applying exactly two operations. The possible variants of the final array `a` after two operations are as follows: `(0, 1, 0)`, `(0, 0, 1)`, `(1, 0, 0)`, `(1, 0, 0)`, `(0, 1, 0)`, `(0, 0, 1)`, `(0, 0, 1)`, `(1, 0, 0)`, `(0, 1, 0)`. Therefore, the answer should be `3 / 9 = 1 / 3`.

2. The code counts the number of zeros and ones in the array `a`, but it does not take into account the effect of the operations. The positions of the zeros and ones can change after each operation, so simply counting them at the beginning is not sufficient.

To correctly calculate the probability, we need to keep track of the number of zeros and ones, and how their positions change after each operation. Counting them at the beginning does not give an accurate representation of their positions after the operations.

3. The code calculates the probability as `p * q_inv` without checking if either `p` or `q` is 0. This can lead to incorrect results. If `p` is 0, the probability should be 0. If `q` is 0, the probability is undefined.

In some cases, the value of `p` or `q` can be 0, which means that the desired probability is 0. It is important to check if `p` or `q` is 0 before calculating the probability.

4. The code uses the `math.factorial` function to calculate the value of `p` and `q`. However, calculating factorials for large numbers can lead to overflow and incorrect results. It would be better to use a different approach to calculate `p` and `q`.

The code uses `math.factorial` to calculate the value of `p` and `q`. However, this approach can lead to overflow for large numbers and may result in incorrect values. It would be better to use a different approach to calculate `p` and `q`.

5. The code uses modular exponentiation to calculate the modular inverse of `q` (i.e., `q_inv`). However, it uses the wrong modulus value (`10**9 + 5` instead of `10**9 + 7`). This will lead to incorrect results.

To calculate the modular inverse of `q`, the correct modulus value to use is `10**9 + 7`, not `10**9 + 5`.

6. The code prints the result as an integer, but it should be printed as a modular inverse.

The result of the probability calculation should be printed as a modular inverse, not as an integer. The code should correctly print the result in the form `P * Q^-1 mod (10**9 + 7)`.

Now, let's provide a fixed version of the code.

Let's start by addressing the first issue with the code: assuming that if `k` is odd, the desired probability is always 0. We need to handle this case correctly.

To do this, we can introduce a variable `sorted` to keep track of whether the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Initially, we assume that `sorted` is `True`. Then, for each pair of indices `i` and `j` chosen in the operations, if `a[i] > a[j]`, we set `sorted` to `False`. After performing all the operations, if `sorted` is still `True`, it means that the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we can print `1`.

Next, we need to address the issue of counting the number of zeros and ones in the array `a` after performing the operations. 

To correctly count the number of zeros and ones, we can iterate over each element of the array `a` and keep track of the counts. Whenever we perform a swap operation, we update the counts accordingly. Finally, we can calculate the values of `p` and `q` using a different approach that avoids calculating factorials for large numbers.

To calculate `p`, we need to find the number of permutations of the array `a` after performing the operations. This can be done by counting the number of inversions in the array. An inversion occurs when there are two elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` such that `i < j` and `a[i] > a[j]`. The number of inversions gives us the value of `p`.

To calculate `q`, we need to find the number of ways to choose `num_zeros - 1` positions from the total number of positions (`num_zeros + num_ones - 2`) to place the zeros. This can be done using combinatorics, specifically the binomial coefficient `C(num_zeros + num_ones - 2, num_zeros - 1)`.

To handle the case when `p` or `q` is zero, we need to add checks before calculating the probability.

Finally, we need to fix the calculation of the modular inverse of `q` by using the correct modulus value (`10**9 + 7`).

Here's the fixed code:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

sorted = True
num_zeros = a.count(0)
num_ones = a.count(1)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            sorted = False

            # Swap elements a[i] and a[j]
            num_zeros += a[i] - a[j]
            num_ones += a[j] - a[i]

p = 0
q = 1

if sorted:
    print(1)
else:
    for i in range(1, num_zeros + num_ones - 1):
        q = (q * i) % MOD

    for i in range(1, num_zeros - 1):
        q = (q * pow(i, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD

    p = (num_zeros * (num_zeros - 1) // 2) % MOD

    if p == 0 or q == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)
        result = (p * q_inv) % MOD
        print(result)
```

By fixing these issues and following the suggested improvements, the code should now correctly calculate the probability for different test cases.
