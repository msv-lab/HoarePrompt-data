Bug: The condition for minimum kvass level calculation is incorrect.\n   - In line 19, the condition `if total_kvass >= s:` should be removed because it is not necessary. The calculation of minimum kvass level should consider the remaining kvass volume regardless of the total kvass volume.\n\n2. Bug: The calculation of remaining kvass volume is incorrect.\n   - In line 17, the calculation `remaining_kvass = s - total_kvass` should be updated to `remaining_kvass = s - (total_kvass - min_kvass)` because the minimum kvass level should already be accounted for in the total kvass volume.\n\n### IMPACT OF THE BUGS\n\n1. Due to the incorrect condition in line 19, if the total kvass volume is greater than or equal to s, the minimum kvass level is set to 0. This results in an incorrect answer when the Fair Nut wants to pour his glass by s liters of kvass but the total kvass volume is already greater than s. In such cases, the minimum kvass level should not be 0.\n   - Example: For the input \"3 4\\n5 3 4\\n\", the output should be 2. But the incorrect code outputs 0.\n\n2. Due to the incorrect calculation of remaining kvass volume in line 17, the remaining kvass volume may not be calculated accurately. This can lead to incorrect calculation of the minimum kvass level in line 21.\n   - Example: For the input \"3 3\\n4 3 5\\n\", the output should be 3. But the incorrect code outputs 0.",
