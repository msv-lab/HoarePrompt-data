I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "3 3
4 3 5
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS FOUND

1. Bug: The condition for minimum kvass level calculation is incorrect.
   - In line 19, the condition `if total_kvass >= s:` should be removed because it is not necessary. The calculation of minimum kvass level should consider the remaining kvass volume regardless of the total kvass volume.

2. Bug: The calculation of remaining kvass volume is incorrect.
   - In line 17, the calculation `remaining_kvass = s - total_kvass` should be updated to `remaining_kvass = s - (total_kvass - min_kvass)` because the minimum kvass level should already be accounted for in the total kvass volume.

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS

1. Due to the incorrect condition in line 19, if the total kvass volume is greater than or equal to s, the minimum kvass level is set to 0. This results in an incorrect answer when the Fair Nut wants to pour his glass by s liters of kvass but the total kvass volume is already greater than s. In such cases, the minimum kvass level should not be 0.
   - Example: For the input "3 4\n5 3 4\n", the output should be 2. But the incorrect code outputs 0.

2. Due to the incorrect calculation of remaining kvass volume in line 17, the remaining kvass volume may not be calculated accurately. This can lead to incorrect calculation of the minimum kvass level in line 21.
   - Example: For the input "3 3\n4 3 5\n", the output should be 3. But the incorrect code outputs 0.
