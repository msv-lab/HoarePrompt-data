          "feedback": "## Review\nThe overall logic of the code seems correct, but there are a few bugs that need to be addressed. \n\n1. The first bug is in the input. The code assumes that the input is read from standard input using the `input()` function, but it is not specified in the question prompt. Therefore, it is better to assume that the input is already provided in the correct format and stored in variables.\n\n2. The second bug is in the calculation of `additional_rounds` variable. The formula `n*m - k` calculates the number of additional rounds needed correctly, but it is not considering the maximum number of additional rounds that can be conducted. It is important to ensure that the number of additional rounds does not exceed the available number of participants. \n\n3. The third bug is in the calculation of `main_problems` variable. It multiplies the number of main round problems with `n`, which represents the number of winners in each main round. However, the question prompt states that the winners of the round are the first `n` people in the rating list, not `n` winners. So, the number of main problems needed should be `c * (n - 1)` instead of `n * c`.\n\n4. The fourth bug is in the calculation of `total_problems` variable. It adds the number of additional problems and the number of main problems, which is correct. However, since we are trying to minimize the total number of problems, the minimum number of problems needed for the additional rounds should also be considered. Therefore, we need to change `additional_problems` calculation to `min(additional_problems, additional_rounds)`.\n\n5. Lastly, there is no need to calculate `min_problems` variable as it is not being used. So, we can remove that line.\n\nThese are the bugs I have identified in the code. Let me know if you need any further clarification.",
