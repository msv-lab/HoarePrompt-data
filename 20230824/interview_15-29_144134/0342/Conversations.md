I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Let's call a string good if and only if it consists of only two types of letters — 'a' and 'b' and every two consecutive letters are distinct. For example "baba" and "aba" are good strings and "abb" is a bad string.

You have $a$ strings "a", $b$ strings "b" and $c$ strings "ab". You want to choose some subset of these strings and concatenate them in any arbitrarily order.

What is the length of the longest good string you can obtain this way?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9$) — the number of strings "a", "b" and "ab" respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible length of the good string you can obtain.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 1

Output
4

Input
2 1 2

Output
7

Input
3 5 2

Output
11

Input
2 2 1

Output
6

Input
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
4000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example the optimal string is "baba".

In the second example the optimal string is "abababa".

In the third example the optimal string is "bababababab".

In the fourth example the optimal string is "ababab".
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Solution
To find the maximum length of a good string, we need to consider the following cases:

1. If $a = 0$ and $b = 0$: In this case, we can only use the "ab" strings. The maximum length of the good string will be $2c$.
2. If $a = 0$ or $b = 0$: In this case, we can only use either the "a" strings or the "b" strings. The maximum length of the good string will be $2c + 1$.
3. If $a > 0$ and $b > 0$: In this case, we can use both the "a" and "b" strings. The maximum length of the good string will be $2c + 2$.

We need to choose the maximum value from the above cases as the result.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

if a == 0 or b == 0:
    result = 2 * c + 1
else:
    result = 2 * c + 2

print(result)
```
This code takes three integers as input and stores them in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Then it checks the conditions mentioned above and calculates the maximum length of the good string. Finally, it prints the result.

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "2 1 2
" the output was "6
" but the expected output was "7
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ## Solution Review

The code provided seems to have a bug that causes it to incorrectly calculate the maximum possible length of a good string given the number of "a", "b", and "ab" strings available. Let's go through the code line by line to identify the issues.


### Input
The code starts by reading three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. These integers represent the number of strings "a", "b", and "ab" respectively.

The input reading seems correct and should not be causing any bugs.


### Calculation
The code then performs a calculation to determine the maximum possible length of a good string based on the given input.

``` python
if a == 0 or b == 0:
    result = 2 * c + 1
else:
    result = 2 * c + 2
```

This calculation is faulty and does not correctly determine the maximum possible length of a good string.

1. If either `a` or `b` is zero, the code adds `2 * c + 1` to the result. This accounts for all available "ab" strings, adds 1 for the remaining "a" or "b" string, but fails to account for any potential combination of "ab" and one other type of string (either "a" or "b") that could form a longer good string.

2. If neither `a` nor `b` is zero, the code adds `2 * c + 2` to the result. This accounts for all available "ab" strings, adds 2 for both the remaining "a" and "b" strings, but again fails to consider any potential combination of "ab" and both other types of strings that could result in a longer good string.


### Output
The code then prints the calculated result:

``` python
print(result)
```


### Bugs
Based on the above analysis, the following bugs can be identified in the code:

1. The calculation of the maximum possible length of a good string is incorrect and does not consider all possible combinations of "ab", "a", and "b" strings.

2. The code assumes that the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive, but there is no explicit check or validation for this. If any of these inputs are negative, the code will still produce an output without addressing the invalid input.


### Impact on Functionality
The identified bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The incorrect calculation of the maximum possible length of a good string means that the code will provide incorrect results in many cases. This can lead to incorrect decisions and outputs in scenarios where the maximum possible length of a good string is not simply `2 * c + 1` or `2 * c + 2`. Additionally, the lack of input validation can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect outputs if negative values are provided for `a`, `b`, or `c`.


### Suggestions for Improvement
To fix the identified bugs and improve the functionality of the code, the following suggestions can be made:

1. Consider all possible combinations of "ab", "a", and "b" strings to determine the maximum possible length of a good string. This can be achieved using a combination of the available strings and checking their lengths.

2. Add input validation to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. If any of the inputs are negative, print an error message or handle the invalid input appropriately.

3. Add comments to the code to improve readability and make it easier for others (including yourself) to understand the purpose and logic of the different sections of the code.


## Summary
The given code contains bugs that result in incorrect calculations of the maximum possible length of a good string. The code does not consider all possible combinations of "ab", "a", and "b" strings, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the code does not perform input validation to ensure that the inputs are positive integers. Implementing the suggested improvements will address the identified bugs and improve the functionality of the code.

### CORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# Check if a, b, and c are positive integers
if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
    print("Invalid input. The number of strings must be positive integers.")
else:
    # Calculate the maximum possible length of a good string
    max_length = 2 * min(a, b) + 2 * c

    # If there are remaining "a" or "b" strings, add 1 to the maximum length
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        max_length += 1

    print(max_length)
