I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Polycarpus develops an interesting theory about the interrelation of arithmetic progressions with just everything in the world. His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.

Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.

Unfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of a_{i} ​​may be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.

For a given sequence a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}), which consists of positive integers and values ​​-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values ​​-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values a_{i} > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.

Let us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference c_{i} + 1 - c_{i} of any two consecutive elements in it is constant. By definition, any sequence of length 1 is an arithmetic progression.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains integer values a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} separated by a space (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9 or a_{i} =  - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of arithmetic progressions that you need to write one after another to get sequence a. The positions marked as -1 in a can be represented by any positive integers.


-----Examples-----

9
8 6 4 2 1 4 7 10 2

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "9
8 6 4 2 1 4 7 10 2
" the output was "5
" but the expected output was "3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED
1. There is a bug in the calculation of the number of progressions. The calculation `progressions += 1` is incorrectly placed inside the condition `elif a[i-1] == -1`. It should be outside the condition.
2. There is a bug in the condition to check if the sequence is an arithmetic progression. The condition `a[i] - a[i-1] != a[i-1] - a[i-2]` is incorrect. It should be `a[i] != a[i-1] + (a[i-1] - a[i-2])`.
3. There is a bug in the count of elements in the sequence. The initial value of `count` is incorrect. It should be initialized as `1` only if the first element in the sequence is not equal to `-1`.

### IMPACT OF BUGS
1. The incorrect placement of the calculation `progressions += 1` inside the condition results in a higher count of progressions than expected.
2. The incorrect condition to check if the sequence is an arithmetic progression can lead to incorrect categorization of elements in progressions.
3. The incorrect initialization of `count` can result in a lower count of elements in the sequence if the first element is equal to `-1`.

Apologies for the confusion. Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
progressions = 0

if a[0] != -1:
    count = 1

for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != -1:
        if a[i] != a[i-1] + (a[i-1] - a[i-2]):
            progressions += 1
        count += 1

if count == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    print(progressions + 1)
```

In this code, I have fixed the bugs as follows:

1. The initialization of `count` has been corrected. It is now initialized as `0` instead of `1`.
2. The condition to check if the first element is not equal to `-1` has been added. If it is not, `count` is set to `1`.
3. The condition to check if the sequence is an arithmetic progression has been corrected. It now checks if `a[i]` is equal to the previous element plus the difference between the two previous elements (`a[i-1] + (a[i-1] - a[i-2])`).
4. The calculation `progressions += 1` has been moved outside the condition.


Now the code should give the correct output.
