          "feedback": "### BUGS\n\nThere are two bugs in the code:\n\n1. The code does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `0`.\n2. The code is using integer division (`//`) instead of normal division (`/`) when calculating `n //= b`.\n\n### BUG 1: Handling `n = 0`\n\nCurrently, the code does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `0`. This is important because if `n` is equal to `0`, then the factorial of `0` is `1`. As a result, the code should return `0` in this case.\n\n### BUG 2: Using integer division (`//`)\n\nThe code is using integer division (`//`) instead of normal division (`/`) when calculating `n //= b`. This means that any fractional part of the division is truncated. However, in this case, we want to consider the fractional part because it represents the number of trailing zeros. By using integer division, we are effectively discarding the fractional part and not considering it in the count.\n\n### IMPACT\n\nThese bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:\n\n1. Bug 1:\n   - If `n` is equal to `0`, the code currently returns `0`.\n   - The correct behavior should be to return `0`, as the factorial of `0` is `1` and does not have any trailing zeros.\n   - This bug affects the correctness of the output when `n` is equal to `0`.\n\n2. Bug 2:\n   - By using integer division, the code is discarding the fractional part of the division, which represents the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of `n`.\n   - This bug affects the correctness of the output when there are trailing zeros in the factorial of `n`.\n\nIn the given example (`6 9`), the output should be `1` because the factorial of `6` in base `9` has one trailing zero. However, the current code returns `0` due to the aforementioned bugs.",
