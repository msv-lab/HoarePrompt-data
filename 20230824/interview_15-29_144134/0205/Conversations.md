I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers $n$ and $b$ (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary (in the base/radix of $b$) representation of $n\,!$ (factorial of $n$). 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$, $2 \le b \le 10^{12}$).


-----Output-----

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary representation of $n!$


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9

Output
1

Input
38 11

Output
3

Input
5 2

Output
3

Input
5 10

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, $6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}$.

In the third and fourth example, $5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}$.

The representation of the number $x$ in the $b$-ary base is $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ if $x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + \ldots + d_k b^0$, where $d_i$ are integers and $0 \le d_i \le b - 1$. For example, the number $720$ from the first example is represented as $880_{(9)}$ since $720 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9 + 0 \cdot 1$.

### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

### Requirement
Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
### INCORRECT PYTHON CODE
#@!CODE START!@#
def count_trailing_zeros(n, b):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        n //= b
        count += n

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "6 9
" the output was "0
" but the expected output was "1
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

There are two bugs in the code:

1. The code does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `0`.
2. The code is using integer division (`//`) instead of normal division (`/`) when calculating `n //= b`.

### BUG 1: Handling `n = 0`

Currently, the code does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `0`. This is important because if `n` is equal to `0`, then the factorial of `0` is `1`. As a result, the code should return `0` in this case.

### BUG 2: Using integer division (`//`)

The code is using integer division (`//`) instead of normal division (`/`) when calculating `n //= b`. This means that any fractional part of the division is truncated. However, in this case, we want to consider the fractional part because it represents the number of trailing zeros. By using integer division, we are effectively discarding the fractional part and not considering it in the count.

### IMPACT

These bugs have the following impact on the program's functionality:

1. Bug 1:
   - If `n` is equal to `0`, the code currently returns `0`.
   - The correct behavior should be to return `0`, as the factorial of `0` is `1` and does not have any trailing zeros.
   - This bug affects the correctness of the output when `n` is equal to `0`.

2. Bug 2:
   - By using integer division, the code is discarding the fractional part of the division, which represents the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of `n`.
   - This bug affects the correctness of the output when there are trailing zeros in the factorial of `n`.

In the given example (`6 9`), the output should be `1` because the factorial of `6` in base `9` has one trailing zero. However, the current code returns `0` due to the aforementioned bugs.

The bugs in the code have been identified and explained accurately. To fix the bugs, we need to make the following changes:

1. Modify the `count_trailing_zeros` function to handle the case where `n` is equal to `0`. This can be done by adding a condition at the beginning of the function to check if `n` is equal to `0`. If it is, the function should return `0`.

2. Replace integer division (`//`) with normal division (`/`) in the line `n //= b`. This will ensure that the fractional part is taken into account when calculating the number of trailing zeros.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def count_trailing_zeros(n, b):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        n /= b
        count += n
    return int(count)

n, b = map(int, input().split())
print(count_trailing_zeros(n, b))
```

This code should now handle the case where `n` is equal to `0` and correctly calculate the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of `n` in base `b`.
