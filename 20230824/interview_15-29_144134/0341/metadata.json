The if conditions in the `max_score` function are not correct. \n4. The scoring system is not implemented correctly. \n\n### BUG 1: Incorrect input reading code\n\nThe program is using the `input()` function to read the input, but the function has not been properly integrated into the code. The input should be read as arguments to the `max_score` function instead of using `input()`. \n\n### BUG 2: Incorrect logic in `max_score` function\n\nThe logic of the `max_score` function is incorrect. It does not take into account the requirement that the player cannot use the same hand in consecutive rounds. \n\n### BUG 3: Incorrect if conditions in `max_score` function\n\nThe if conditions in the `max_score` function are incorrect. The condition `if i < K or T[i] != T[i-K]:` is not correct.\n\n### BUG 4: Incorrect scoring system\n\nThe current scoring system is not implemented correctly. It does not assign the correct scores to each hand based on the winning conditions mentioned in the problem description. \n\n### IMPACT OF THE BUGS\n\nThese bugs have significant impact on the functionality of the program:\n1. Incorrect input reading code results in the program not being able to read the necessary input values correctly.\n2. Incorrect logic in the `max_score` function leads to incorrect score calculations and incorrect output.\n3. Incorrect if conditions in the `max_score` function can cause incorrect scoring and potentially wrong hand choices.\n4. Incorrect scoring system results in incorrect scores being assigned to each hand, leading to incorrect final score calculation.\n\nThese bugs prevent the program from providing the correct output and meeting the requirements of the problem statement.",
