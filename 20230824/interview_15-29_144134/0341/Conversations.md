I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
At an arcade, Takahashi is playing a game called RPS Battle, which is played as follows:
 - The player plays N rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against the machine. (See Notes for the description of Rock Paper Scissors. A draw also counts as a round.)
 - Each time the player wins a round, depending on which hand he/she uses, he/she earns the following score (no points for a draw or a loss):
 - R points for winning with Rock;
 - S points for winning with Scissors;
 - P points for winning with Paper.
 - However, in the i-th round, the player cannot use the hand he/she used in the (i-K)-th round. (In the first K rounds, the player can use any hand.)
Before the start of the game, the machine decides the hand it will play in each round. With supernatural power, Takahashi managed to read all of those hands.
The information Takahashi obtained is given as a string T. If the i-th character of T (1 \leq i \leq N) is r, the machine will play Rock in the i-th round. Similarly, p and s stand for Paper and Scissors, respectively.
What is the maximum total score earned in the game by adequately choosing the hand to play in each round?

-----Notes-----
In this problem, Rock Paper Scissors can be thought of as a two-player game, in which each player simultaneously forms Rock, Paper, or Scissors with a hand.
 - If a player chooses Rock and the other chooses Scissors, the player choosing Rock wins;
 - if a player chooses Scissors and the other chooses Paper, the player choosing Scissors wins;
 - if a player chooses Paper and the other chooses Rock, the player choosing Paper wins;
 - if both players play the same hand, it is a draw.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq N-1
 - 1 \leq R,S,P \leq 10^4
 - N,K,R,S, and P are all integers.
 - |T| = N
 - T consists of r, p, and s.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
R S P
T

-----Output-----
Print the maximum total score earned in the game.

-----Sample Input-----
5 2
8 7 6
rsrpr

-----Sample Output-----
27

The machine will play {Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock}.
We can, for example, play {Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper} against it to earn 27 points.
We cannot earn more points, so the answer is 27.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

#@!CODE START!@#
def max_score(N, K, R, S, P, T):

R, S, P = map(int, input().split())
T = input()

print(max_score(N, K, R, S, P, T))
#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5 2
8 7 6
rsrpr
" the output was "21
" but the expected output was "27
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The input reading code is incorrect. 
2. The logic of the `max_score` function is incorrect. 
3. The if conditions in the `max_score` function are not correct. 
4. The scoring system is not implemented correctly. 

### BUG 1: Incorrect input reading code

The program is using the `input()` function to read the input, but the function has not been properly integrated into the code. The input should be read as arguments to the `max_score` function instead of using `input()`. 

### BUG 2: Incorrect logic in `max_score` function

The logic of the `max_score` function is incorrect. It does not take into account the requirement that the player cannot use the same hand in consecutive rounds. 

### BUG 3: Incorrect if conditions in `max_score` function

The if conditions in the `max_score` function are incorrect. The condition `if i < K or T[i] != T[i-K]:` is not correct.

### BUG 4: Incorrect scoring system

The current scoring system is not implemented correctly. It does not assign the correct scores to each hand based on the winning conditions mentioned in the problem description. 

### IMPACT OF THE BUGS

These bugs have significant impact on the functionality of the program:
1. Incorrect input reading code results in the program not being able to read the necessary input values correctly.
2. Incorrect logic in the `max_score` function leads to incorrect score calculations and incorrect output.
3. Incorrect if conditions in the `max_score` function can cause incorrect scoring and potentially wrong hand choices.
4. Incorrect scoring system results in incorrect scores being assigned to each hand, leading to incorrect final score calculation.

These bugs prevent the program from providing the correct output and meeting the requirements of the problem statement.

The corrected code is given below:

```python
def max_score(N, K, R, S, P, T):
    score = 0
    played = [""] * N   # To keep track of the hands played in previous rounds
    for i in range(N):
        if i < K or T[i] != played[i-K]:
            if T[i] == "r":
                score += R
                played[i] = "r"
            elif T[i] == "s":
                score += S
                played[i] = "s"
            else:
                score += P
                played[i] = "p"
    return score

N, K = map(int, input().split())
R, S, P = map(int, input().split())
T = input()

print(max_score(N, K, R, S, P, T))
```

The changes made to the code are as follows:

1. The input is correctly read as function arguments `N, K, R, S, P, T` instead of using `input()` within the function.
2. A list `played` is initialized to keep track of the hands played in previous rounds.
3. The condition `if i < K or T[i] != T[i-K]:` is modified to check if the current hand is different from the hand played K rounds ago.
4. The scoring system is corrected by adding the respective points to the `score` based on the hand played.
5. The hand played in each round is stored in the `played` list to check for consecutive use of the same hand.

With these changes, the code should now correctly calculate and return the maximum total score earned in the game.
