          "feedback": "### Feedback\nThere are multiple issues with the provided code. Let's discuss them one by one.\n\n1. The formula to calculate the maximum possible sum in the k-th column is incorrect.\n   - The formula `max_sum = n*n - (n-k)*n` does not take into account the fact that the numbers in each row should be arranged in increasing order.\n   - To calculate the maximum possible sum in the k-th column, we can use the formula `max_sum = (n*n + (n-k)*(k-1)) // k`.\n   - This formula takes into account that in each row, there will be (k-1) elements smaller than the largest element in the k-th column.\n\n2. The table initialization is incorrect. \n   - The code initializes the table with all zeros using this line: `table = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]`.\n   - However, the table should be initialized in increasing order, not with zeros.\n   - To initialize the table, we can use a nested loop and assign consecutive numbers to each element of the table.\n\n3. The swapping of elements in the k-th column is incorrect.\n   - The code uses the following swapping logic: `table[i][k-1], table[i][n-1] = table[i][n-1], table[i][k-1]`.\n   - However, this logic does not guarantee that the sum in the k-th column will be maximum.\n   - To maximize the sum in the k-th column, we need to move the largest element of the column to the last position.\n\n4. The expected output is not being printed correctly.\n   - The code prints the table using the following loop: `for i in range(n): print(\" \".join(str(x) for x in table[i]))`\n   - However, this does not match the expected output format, where each row should be printed on a separate line.\n\nThese are the bugs and issues present in the code. Now, it's up to you to fix them and make the necessary changes to get the correct output. Good luck!",
