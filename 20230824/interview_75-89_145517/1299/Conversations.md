I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as n laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to n). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.

This time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2k laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to n of length k and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers a, b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n - k + 1, b - a ≥ k) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [a; a + k - 1] and [b; b + k - 1] (borders are included).

As mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 0 < 2k ≤ n) — the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} — the absurdity of each law (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print two integers a, b — the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [a; a + k - 1] and [b; b + k - 1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number a. If there still are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum b.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
3 6 1 1 6

Output
1 4

Input
6 2
1 1 1 1 1 1

Output
1 3



-----Note-----

In the first sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [4;5]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 3 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 16.

In the second sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [3;4]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "5 2
3 6 1 1 6
" the output was "1 3
" but the expected output was "1 4
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Observations:

- The code reads the input correctly and calculates the prefix sum of the absurdity values correctly.
- The code iterates through all possible segments, but there is an issue with the calculation of the absurdity values for the segments.
- The code wrongly calculates "segment2_absurdity" by subtracting "prefix_sum[i + k - 1]" from "prefix_sum[n]". This should be "prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i + k]" to include the absurdity value at position "i + k".
- The code updates the maximum total absurdity and the positions of the segments correctly.
- The code prints the positions of the segments correctly.

### Bugs:

1. The calculation of "segment2_absurdity" is incorrect.

### Impact:

The bug in the code causes the incorrect calculation of the total absurdity of the second segment. This leads to the incorrect selection of segments and results in an incorrect output.
