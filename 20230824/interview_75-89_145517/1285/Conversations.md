I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")

### QUESTION
You are given a binary matrix $A$ of size $n \times n$. Let's denote an $x$-compression of the given matrix as a matrix $B$ of size $\frac{n}{x} \times \frac{n}{x}$ such that for every $i \in [1, n], j \in [1, n]$ the condition $A[i][j] = B[\lceil \frac{i}{x} \rceil][\lceil \frac{j}{x} \rceil]$ is met.

Obviously, $x$-compression is possible only if $x$ divides $n$, but this condition is not enough. For example, the following matrix of size $2 \times 2$ does not have any $2$-compression:

 $01$   $10$ 

For the given matrix $A$, find maximum $x$ such that an $x$-compression of this matrix is possible.

Note that the input is given in compressed form. But even though it is compressed, you'd better use fast input.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one number $n$ ($4 \le n \le 5200$) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix $A$. It is guaranteed that $n$ is divisible by $4$.

Then the representation of matrix follows. Each of $n$ next lines contains $\frac{n}{4}$ one-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can be represented either as digits from $0$ to $9$ or as uppercase Latin letters from $A$ to $F$). Binary representation of each of these numbers denotes next $4$ elements of the matrix in the corresponding row. For example, if the number $B$ is given, then the corresponding elements are 1011, and if the number is $5$, then the corresponding elements are 0101.

Elements are not separated by whitespaces.


-----Output-----

Print one number: maximum $x$ such that an $x$-compression of the given matrix is possible.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the matrix:  $11100111$   $11100111$   $11100111$   $00000000$   $00000000$   $11100111$   $11100111$   $11100111$ 

It is easy to see that the answer on this example is $1$.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

You are given a binary matrix $A$ of size $n \times n$.

" the output was "3

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS

1. Misunderstanding of the input format: The code assumes that there are n rows and n columns in the matrix A. However, according to the problem statement, the input format specifies that there are n rows and n/4 columns. This misunderstanding leads to incorrect matrix manipulation and incorrect results.

2. Incorrect check for x-compression: The code checks if an x-compression is possible by iterating over all elements in the matrix and comparing them to the first element in each x-compression block. However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks if the elements in one x-compression block are the same, but it doesn't check if the elements in different x-compression blocks are the same.

3. Incorrect update of maximum x: The code updates the maximum x every time an x-compression is found, even if a larger value of x is possible. This leads to incorrect results because the code doesn't consider larger values of x after finding a smaller value that satisfies the x-compression condition.

4. Wrong loop range in checking for x-compression: The code iterates from 0 to n in steps of x when checking for x-compression. However, this leads to incorrect results because it doesn't consider the elements in the last x-compression block. The loop range should be adjusted to consider the last x-compression block.

5. Incorrect assumption about input size: The code assumes that the value of n will always be divisible by 4. However, this assumption is not mentioned in the problem statement and should not be made. If the input doesn't satisfy this assumption, the code will produce incorrect results or raise an error.

### IMPACT

1. The misunderstanding of the input format leads to incorrect manipulation of the matrix and incorrect results.

2. The incorrect check for x-compression leads to incorrect results because it doesn't consider the elements in different x-compression blocks.

3. The incorrect update of maximum x leads to incorrect results because the code doesn't consider larger values of x after finding a smaller value that satisfies the x-compression condition.

4. The wrong loop range in checking for x-compression leads to incorrect results because it doesn't consider the elements in the last x-compression block.

5. The incorrect assumption about input size leads to incorrect results or errors if the input doesn't satisfy the assumption.

#### Solution
To fix the bugs in the code, we need to make the following changes:

1. Change the loop for reading the input matrix to consider n/4 columns instead of n columns.

2. Modify the check for x-compression to consider elements in different x-compression blocks.

3. Adjust the loop range in checking for x-compression to consider the last x-compression block.

4. Remove the incorrect assumption about input size and handle the case where n is not divisible by 4.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Get the value of n
n = int(input())

# Read the matrix and convert hexadecimal numbers to their binary representations
matrix = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = input().strip()
    binary_row = bin(int(row, 16))[2:].zfill(n // 4 * 4)
    matrix.append(binary_row)

# Initialize the maximum x
max_x = 1

# Iterate over all possible values of x
for x in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
    # Check if x is a divisor of n
    if n % x == 0:
        # Check if an x-compression is possible
        possible = True
        for i in range(0, n, x):
            for j in range(0, n, x):
                # Check if all elements in the x-compression are the same
                element = matrix[i][j]
                for a in range(i, min(i + x, n)):
                    for b in range(j, min(j + x, n)):
                        if matrix[a][b] != element:
                            possible = False
                            break
                    if not possible:
                        break
                if not possible:
                    break
            if not possible:
                break
        # Update the maximum x if an x-compression is possible
        if possible:
            max_x = x
        else:
            break

# Print the maximum x
print(max_x)
```

Now the code should produce the correct results and handle input correctly.
