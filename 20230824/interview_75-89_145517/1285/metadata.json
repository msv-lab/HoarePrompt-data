          "feedback": "### BUGS\n\n1. Misunderstanding of the input format: The code assumes that there are n rows and n columns in the matrix A. However, according to the problem statement, the input format specifies that there are n rows and n/4 columns. This misunderstanding leads to incorrect matrix manipulation and incorrect results.\n\n2. Incorrect check for x-compression: The code checks if an x-compression is possible by iterating over all elements in the matrix and comparing them to the first element in each x-compression block. However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks if the elements in one x-compression block are the same, but it doesn't check if the elements in different x-compression blocks are the same.\n\n3. Incorrect update of maximum x: The code updates the maximum x every time an x-compression is found, even if a larger value of x is possible. This leads to incorrect results because the code doesn't consider larger values of x after finding a smaller value that satisfies the x-compression condition.\n\n4. Wrong loop range in checking for x-compression: The code iterates from 0 to n in steps of x when checking for x-compression. However, this leads to incorrect results because it doesn't consider the elements in the last x-compression block. The loop range should be adjusted to consider the last x-compression block.\n\n5. Incorrect assumption about input size: The code assumes that the value of n will always be divisible by 4. However, this assumption is not mentioned in the problem statement and should not be made. If the input doesn't satisfy this assumption, the code will produce incorrect results or raise an error.\n\n### IMPACT\n\n1.
