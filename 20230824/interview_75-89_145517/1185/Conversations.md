I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
The new ITone 6 has been released recently and George got really keen to buy it. Unfortunately, he didn't have enough money, so George was going to work as a programmer. Now he faced the following problem at the work.

Given a sequence of n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. You are to choose k pairs of integers:

 [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_{k}, r_{k}] (1 ≤ l_1 ≤ r_1 < l_2 ≤ r_2 < ... < l_{k} ≤ r_{k} ≤ n; r_{i} - l_{i} + 1 = m), 

in such a way that the value of sum $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \sum_{j = l_{i}}^{r_{i}} p_{j}$ is maximal possible. Help George to cope with the task.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ (m × k) ≤ n ≤ 5000). The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print an integer in a single line — the maximum possible value of sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 1
1 2 3 4 5

Output
9

Input
7 1 3
2 10 7 18 5 33 0

Output
61
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### REVIEW

I have reviewed your code and found a few bugs that are causing unexpected results. Here are the details:

1. Issue with assigning values to variables:
    - In the first line, you are trying to assign values to `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the values are not properly separated by spaces, resulting in incorrect assignment of variables. This is causing incorrect values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and hence, affecting the calculation of maximum sum.

2. Sorting the sequence:
    - You are sorting the sequence `p` in descending order using `p.sort(reverse=True)`. However, this sorting is not necessary for solving the problem. The problem requires finding pairs in the original sequence, not the sorted sequence. Removing this sorting operation will not affect the logic of the program, but will improve the efficiency.

3. Choosing pairs with length `m`:
    - The logic for choosing pairs with length `m` using `[p[i:i+m] for i in range(0, n, m)]` is incorrect. This code is splitting the sequence into multiple subarrays of length `m`, but it does not guarantee that the subarrays will be valid pairs with length `m`. For example, if `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 1`, the valid pairs should be `[p[1:2]]`, `[p[3:4]]`, and `[p[5:6]]`, but the code will generate invalid pairs like `[p[1:2]]`, `[p[3:4]]`, and `[p[5:6]]`. This bug is causing incorrect calculation of maximum sum.

4. Calculation of maximum sum:
    - The calculation of maximum sum using `max_sum = sum(sum(pair) for pair in pairs[:k])` is almost correct, but it does not handle the case where the number of valid pairs with length `m` is less than `k`. In such cases, attempting to access `pairs[:k]` will result in an `IndexError`. To fix this, you need to handle this case separately and calculate the maximum sum accordingly.

I hope you find this feedback helpful in identifying and fixing the bugs in your code. Let me know if you have any further questions.
