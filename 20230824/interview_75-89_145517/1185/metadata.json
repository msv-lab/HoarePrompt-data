          "feedback": "### REVIEW\n\nI have reviewed your code and found a few bugs that are causing unexpected results. Here are the details:\n\n1. Issue with assigning values to variables:\n    - In the first line, you are trying to assign values to `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the values are not properly separated by spaces, resulting in incorrect assignment of variables. This is causing incorrect values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and hence, affecting the calculation of maximum sum.\n\n2. Sorting the sequence:\n    - You are sorting the sequence `p` in descending order using `p.sort(reverse=True)`. However, this sorting is not necessary for solving the problem. The problem requires finding pairs in the original sequence, not the sorted sequence. Removing this sorting operation will not affect the logic of the program, but will improve the efficiency.\n\n3. Choosing pairs with length `m`:\n    - The logic for choosing pairs with length `m` using `[p[i:i+m] for i in range(0, n, m)]` is incorrect. This code is splitting the sequence into multiple subarrays of length `m`, but it does not guarantee that the subarrays will be valid pairs with length `m`. For example, if `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 1`, the valid pairs should be `[p[1:2]]`, `[p[3:4]]`, and `[p[5:6]]`, but the code will generate invalid pairs like `[p[1:2]]`, `[p[3:4]]`, and `[p[5:6]]`. This bug is causing incorrect calculation of maximum sum.\n\n4. Calculation of maximum sum:\n    - The calculation of maximum sum using `max_sum = sum(sum(pair) for pair in pairs[:k])` is almost correct, but it does not handle the case where the number of valid pairs with length `m` is less than `k`. In such cases, attempting to access `pairs[:k]` will result in an `IndexError`. To fix this, you need to handle this case separately and calculate the maximum sum accordingly.\n\nI hope you find this feedback helpful in identifying and fixing the bugs in your code. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
