I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Little Tanya decided to present her dad a postcard on his Birthday. She has already created a message — string s of length n, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Tanya can't write yet, so she found a newspaper and decided to cut out the letters and glue them into the postcard to achieve string s. The newspaper contains string t, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. We know that the length of string t greater or equal to the length of the string s.

The newspaper may possibly have too few of some letters needed to make the text and too many of some other letters. That's why Tanya wants to cut some n letters out of the newspaper and make a message of length exactly n, so that it looked as much as possible like s. If the letter in some position has correct value and correct letter case (in the string s and in the string that Tanya will make), then she shouts joyfully "YAY!", and if the letter in the given position has only the correct value but it is in the wrong case, then the girl says "WHOOPS".

Tanya wants to make such message that lets her shout "YAY!" as much as possible. If there are multiple ways to do this, then her second priority is to maximize the number of times she says "WHOOPS". Your task is to help Tanya make the message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains line s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2·10^5), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters — the text of Tanya's message.

The second line contains line t (|s| ≤ |t| ≤ 2·10^5), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters — the text written in the newspaper.

Here |a| means the length of the string a.


-----Output-----

Print two integers separated by a space:  the first number is the number of times Tanya shouts "YAY!" while making the message,  the second number is the number of times Tanya says "WHOOPS" while making the message. 


-----Examples-----
Input
AbC
DCbA

Output
3 0

Input
ABC
abc

Output
0 3

Input
abacaba
AbaCaBA

Output
3 4
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

I want you to act as a Code Reviewer who will give feedback on a buggy program. Imagine that you've been given a piece of code that is causing unexpected results. Your task is to scrutinize the code, identify the bugs, and provide constructive feedback. Discuss your findings in detail: what are the bugs? Where in the code do they occur? What impact do they have on the program's functionality?

I want you to act as a Programmer who fixes bugs in programs based on feedback given. Picture yourself receiving a detailed review of a piece of code you've written, which contains several bugs. The feedback points out exactly where the errors lie and suggests improvements. Your task is to carefully analyze the feedback, understand the identified issues and the proposed solutions. Then, you need to implement these fixes in the code. Finally, provide a Python code of your implementation.
## Expected Response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")

#@!CODE END!@#
The code above is wrong and contains bugs. Given input "ABC
abc
" the output was "0 6
" but the expected output was "0 3
".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### BUGS IDENTIFIED

1. The first bug is in the line `if letter not in t_counts:`, where it should be `if letter not in t_counts.keys():`. The bug causes the program to count the number of incorrect letters multiple times, leading to an overestimate of the "WHOOPS" count.

2. The second bug is in the line `for letter in s_counts:`, where it should be `for letter in s:`. The bug causes the program to count the number of "WHOOPS" incorrectly, as it checks all letters in `s_counts` instead of `s`.

3. The third bug is in the line `elif letter.isupper() and letter.lower() in t_counts:`, where it should be `elif letter.isupper() and letter.lower() in t_counts.keys():`. The bug causes the program to count the number of "WHOOPS" incorrectly, as it checks letters in `t_counts` which may not actually exist.

### IMPACT ON FUNCTIONALITY

1. The first bug causes the program to overestimate the number of incorrect letters, resulting in an inflated "WHOOPS" count. This leads to incorrect output for cases where there are actually fewer incorrect letters.

2. The second bug causes the program to count the number of "WHOOPS" incorrectly, as it includes letters from `s_counts` that may not actually be in `s`. This also leads to incorrect output for cases where there are actually fewer incorrect letters.

3. The third bug causes the program to count the number of "WHOOPS" incorrectly, as it includes letters from `t_counts` that may not actually be in `t`. This further contributes to an inflated "WHOOPS" count.

Overall, these bugs affect the accuracy of the program's output, especially in cases where there are fewer incorrect letters than expected.
