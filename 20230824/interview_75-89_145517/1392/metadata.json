          "feedback": "There are several issues with the given code:\n\n1. The code does not read the input correctly. The first line of input contains the values of `n` and `k`, but the code does not store them correctly. It should be modified as follows:\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n```\n\n2. The code incorrectly uses the `input()` function to read each number in the array. Instead, it should read the numbers using a loop and store them in a list. The `i-th` number should be stored in `a[i-1]`. Here's the modified code:\n```python\na = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a.append(int(input()))\n```\n\n3. The condition `set(num) - set(str(k+1)) == set()` is used to check if a number is \"k-good\". However, this condition is incorrect. It checks if the set of digits in `num` minus the set of digits in `k+1` is an empty set. This means that it only counts numbers that contain digits that are not greater than `k`. To fix this, the condition should be modified to check if the set of digits in `num` is a subset of the set of digits from 0 to `k`. Here's the corrected code:\n```python\nif set(num) <= set(map(str, range(k+1))):\n```\n\n4. The variable `count` is used to keep track of the number of \"k-good\" numbers. However, it is not initialized to 0 at the beginning of the code. It should be initialized like this:\n```python\ncount = 0\n```\n\n5. The variable `count` is only incremented when a number is \"k-good\". However, the problem statement asks to count each number every time it occurs in the array. This means that the variable `count` should be incremented by 1 for every number in the array. The code should be modified as follows:\n```python\ncount += a.count(num)\n```\n\nTaking all these issues into account, here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a.append(int(input()))\n\ncount = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if set(str(num)) <= set(map(str, range(k+1))):\n        count += a.count(num)\n\nprint(count)\n```",
