          "feedback": "### ANALYSIS\nLet's analyze the code and identify the bugs:\n\n1. The code is missing a space after the comma in the input. This causes the third line of the input to be read as a single integer instead of multiple integers. This results in incorrect values being assigned to `y_levels`.\n\n2. The condition `all_levels.issubset(x_levels.union(y_levels))` is checking if all levels are present in the set `x_levels.union(y_levels)`, which is not correct. It should check if all levels are present in the union of `x_levels` and `y_levels` individually. \n\n3. The code does not handle the case where a level is present in `all_levels`, but not in either `x_levels` or `y_levels`. In this case, the code incorrectly considers the level as passed, leading to incorrect results.\n\n### BUGS\n1. Missing space after the comma in the input.\n2. Incorrect condition for checking if all levels are passed.\n3. Missing handling for levels that are present in `all_levels`, but not in either `x_levels` or `y_levels`.\n\n### IMPACT\nThe bugs in the code can lead to incorrect results. The program may incorrectly determine whether Little X and Little Y can pass all levels. This can result in an incorrect output, leading to a misleading message being displayed to the user.",
