I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
After you had helped Fedor to find friends in the «Call of Soldiers 3» game, he stopped studying completely. Today, the English teacher told him to prepare an essay. Fedor didn't want to prepare the essay, so he asked Alex for help. Alex came to help and wrote the essay for Fedor. But Fedor didn't like the essay at all. Now Fedor is going to change the essay using the synonym dictionary of the English language.

Fedor does not want to change the meaning of the essay. So the only change he would do: change a word from essay to one of its synonyms, basing on a replacement rule from the dictionary. Fedor may perform this operation any number of times.

As a result, Fedor wants to get an essay which contains as little letters «R» (the case doesn't matter) as possible. If there are multiple essays with minimum number of «R»s he wants to get the one with minimum length (length of essay is the sum of the lengths of all the words in it). Help Fedor get the required essay.

Please note that in this problem the case of letters doesn't matter. For example, if the synonym dictionary says that word cat can be replaced with word DOG, then it is allowed to replace the word Cat with the word doG.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of words in the initial essay. The second line contains words of the essay. The words are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that the total length of the words won't exceed 10^5 characters.

The next line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of pairs of words in synonym dictionary. The i-th of the next n lines contains two space-separated non-empty words x_{i} and y_{i}. They mean that word x_{i} can be replaced with word y_{i} (but not vise versa). It is guaranteed that the total length of all pairs of synonyms doesn't exceed 5·10^5 characters.

All the words at input can only consist of uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet.


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the minimum number of letters «R» in an optimal essay and the minimum length of an optimal essay.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
AbRb r Zz
4
xR abRb
aA xr
zz Z
xr y

Output
2 6

Input
2
RuruRu fedya
1
ruruRU fedor

Output
1 10
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

" the output was "0 1

".
The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### ANALYSIS

There are multiple bugs in the given code:

#### 1. Incorrect Parsing of Input
The code does not correctly parse the input. The first line of input represents the number of words in the initial essay, `m`, but the code does not capture this value. It directly goes to parsing the essay itself.

#### 2. Incorrect Initialization of Variables
The variables `min_r` and `min_length` are initialized with `float('inf')`, which means they are initialized with infinity. However, since we are trying to find the minimum values, these variables should be initialized with a very large value, such as `float('inf')`. 

#### 3. Incorrect Counting of Letters 'R'
The function `count_r` counts the number of occurrences of the letter 'r', but it does not account for case-insensitivity. The function should convert the word to lowercase before counting the occurrences of the letter 'r'.

#### 4. Incorrect Replacement Rule
The function `replace_word` tries to replace a word with its synonym if it exists in the synonym dictionary. However, the code only considers the first synonym it finds. It does not consider all possible synonyms and choose the one with the minimum number of 'r's. 

#### 5. Incorrect Updating of Minimum Variables
The code updates `min_r` and `min_length` after appending a new word to the `new_essay` list. However, `min_length` should represent the length of the entire essay, not just the length of the `new_essay` list. It should be updated after the entire essay is constructed.

#### 6. Incorrect Output
The code prints `min_r` and `min_length` as the output. However, since `min_r` represents the minimum number of 'r's in the essay and `min_length` represents the minimum length of the essay, they should be printed in reverse order as the output.
