I want you to act as a Coding Contest Participant. Imagine that you are taking part in a prestigious coding competition. Your task is to design an efficient algorithm for a complex problem. You need to consider all possible edge cases, optimize for efficiency, and ensure that your solution is clean and readable. In addition, provide a Python code of your solution, and put the solution in a code delimiter.For example:
### QUESTION
A. Watermelon
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 <= w <= 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input
8
output
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

### Expected response from you
#@!CODE START!@#
w = int(input())
if w % 2 == 1 or w < 4:
print("NO")
else:
print("YES")
#@!CODE END!@#

### QUESTION
Disclaimer: there are lots of untranslateable puns in the Russian version of the statement, so there is one more reason for you to learn Russian :)

Rick and Morty like to go to the ridge High Cry for crying loudly — there is an extraordinary echo. Recently they discovered an interesting acoustic characteristic of this ridge: if Rick and Morty begin crying simultaneously from different mountains, their cry would be heard between these mountains up to the height equal the bitwise OR of mountains they've climbed and all the mountains between them. 

Bitwise OR is a binary operation which is determined the following way. Consider representation of numbers x and y in binary numeric system (probably with leading zeroes) x = x_{k}... x_1x_0 and y = y_{k}... y_1y_0. Then z = x | y is defined following way: z = z_{k}... z_1z_0, where z_{i} = 1, if x_{i} = 1 or y_{i} = 1, and z_{i} = 0 otherwise. In the other words, digit of bitwise OR of two numbers equals zero if and only if digits at corresponding positions is both numbers equals zero. For example bitwise OR of numbers 10 = 1010_2 and 9 = 1001_2 equals 11 = 1011_2. In programming languages C/C++/Java/Python this operation is defined as «|», and in Pascal as «or».

Help Rick and Morty calculate the number of ways they can select two mountains in such a way that if they start crying from these mountains their cry will be heard above these mountains and all mountains between them. More formally you should find number of pairs l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) such that bitwise OR of heights of all mountains between l and r (inclusive) is larger than the height of any mountain at this interval.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000), the number of mountains in the ridge.

Second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), the heights of mountains in order they are located in the ridge.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer, the number of ways to choose two different mountains.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
3 2 1 6 5

Output
8

Input
4
3 3 3 3

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test case all the ways are pairs of mountains with the numbers (numbering from one):(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)

In the second test case there are no such pairs because for any pair of mountains the height of cry from them is 3, and this height is equal to the height of any mountain.
### Requirements
1. Use Standard Input Format (read inputs with `input()`, write results with `print()`)
2. You will NOT return anything except for the program. 
3. DO NOT WRITE PLANS OR EXPLANATIONS

The following is a detailed explanation of the issues: 
            ### Review

The provided code attempts to calculate the number of ways to select two mountains such that their cry will be heard above these mountains and all mountains between them. However, there are a few bugs in the code that are causing incorrect outputs.

Let's go through the code and identify the bugs:

### 1. Incorrect calculation of `max_height_indexes`

In line 4, the code is supposed to find the indexes of the tallest mountains. However, it is currently finding the indexes of the mountains equal to the maximum height, rather than the tallest mountains. This will lead to incorrect calculations later on.

To fix this, we need to change the condition in line 4 from `if h == max_height` to `if h >= max_height`.

### 2. Incorrect calculation of the number of ways

In lines 9-12, the code attempts to calculate the number of ways to select two mountains that satisfy the given condition. However, there are two issues here:

a. The loop variable `i` is incorrectly used for both the outer and inner loop. This will result in counting some pairs more than once.

b. The condition `if h1 | h2 > max_height` is incorrect. It should be `if h1 | h2 > max_height and i < j`.

To fix these issues:
a. Change the outer loop to iterate from 0 to `n-2`.

b. Change the condition in line 11 to `if h1 | h2 > max_height and i < j`.

With these changes, the code should produce the correct output.

### Updated code:

```python
def count_ways_to_cry(n, heights):
    count = 0
    max_height = max(heights)   # height of the tallest mountain
    max_height_indexes = [i for i, h in enumerate(heights) if h >= max_height]   # indexes of the tallest mountains
    
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            h1 = heights[i]
            h2 = heights[j]
            if h1 | h2 > max_height and i < j:   # if bitwise OR of heights is larger than the tallest mountain
                count += 1
    
    return count

n = int(input())
heights = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = count_ways_to_cry(n, heights)
print(result)
```

After applying these fixes, the code should produce the expected output.
