Recently, akshiM met a task that needed binomial coefficients to solve. He
wrote a code he usually does that looked like this:

        for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) { // loop over n from 0 to N-1 (inclusive)  
            C[n][0] = 1;  
            C[n][n] = 1;  
            for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) // loop over k from 1 to n-1 (inclusive)  
                C[n][k] = C[n][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k - 1];  
        }  
    
Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following:

                C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k] + C[n - 1][k - 1]  
    
But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using
the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for t
various pairs (n_i, k_i) . Note that they should be calculated according to
the first (wrong) formula.

Since values C[n_i][k_i] may be too large, print them modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ) â€” the number of
pairs. Next, t pairs are written in two lines.

The second line contains t integers n_1, n_2, \dots, n_t (2 \le n_i \le 10^5
).

The third line contains t integers k_1, k_2, \dots, k_t (1 \le k_i < n_i ).

Output

Print t integers C[n_i][k_i] modulo 10^9 + 7 .
