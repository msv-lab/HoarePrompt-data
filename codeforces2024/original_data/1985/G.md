Let D(n) represent the sum of digits of n . For how many integers n where
10^{l} \leq n < 10^{r} satisfy D(k \cdot n) = k \cdot D(n) ? Output the answer
modulo 10^9+7 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) â€“ the number of
test cases.

Each test case contains three integers l , r , and k (0 \leq l < r \leq 10^9 ,
1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, output an integer, the answer, modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Example

Input

    0 1 4
    
    0 2 7
    
    1 2 1
    
    1 2 3
    
    582 74663 3
    
    0 3 1

Output

    2
    3
    90
    12
    974995667
    999
    
Note

For the first test case, the only values of n that satisfy the condition are 1
and 2 .

For the second test case, the only values of n that satisfy the condition are
1 , 10 , and 11 .

For the third test case, all values of n between 10 inclusive and 100
exclusive satisfy the condition.
