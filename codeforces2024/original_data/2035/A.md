Red was ejected. They were not the imposter.

There are n rows of m people. Let the position in the r -th row and the c -th
column be denoted by (r, c) . Number each person starting from 1 in row-major
order, i.e., the person numbered (r-1)\cdot m+c is initially at (r,c) .

The person at (r, c) decides to leave. To fill the gap, let the person who
left be numbered i . Each person numbered j>i will move to the position where
the person numbered j-1 is initially at. The following diagram illustrates the
case where n=2 , m=3 , r=1 , and c=2 .

Calculate the sum of the Manhattan distances of each person's movement. If a
person was initially at (r_0, c_0) and then moved to (r_1, c_1) , the
Manhattan distance is |r_0-r_1|+|c_0-c_1| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

The only line of each testcase contains 4 integers n , m , r , and c (1\le
r\le n\le 10^6 , 1 \le c \le m \le 10^6 ), where n is the number of rows, m is
the number of columns, and (r,c) is the position where the person who left is
initially at.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the sum of the Manhattan
distances.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 3 1 2
    
    2 2 2 1
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    1000000 1000000 1 1

Output

    6
    1
    0
    1999998000000
    
Note

For the first test case, the person numbered 2 leaves, and the distances of
the movements of the person numbered 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are 1 , 3 , 1 , and 1 ,
respectively. So the answer is 1+3+1+1=6 .

For the second test case, the person numbered 3 leaves, and the person
numbered 4 moves. The answer is 1 .
