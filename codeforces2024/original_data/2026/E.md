Given an integer array a of size n .

Let's define the value of the array as its size minus the number of set bits
in the bitwise OR of all elements of the array.

For example, for the array [1, 0, 1, 2] , the bitwise OR is 3 (which contains
2 set bits), and the value of the array is 4-2=2 .

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of some subsequence of
the given array.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{60} ).

Output

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of some subsequence of
the given array.
