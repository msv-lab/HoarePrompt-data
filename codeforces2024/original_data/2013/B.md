Eralim, being the mafia boss, manages a group of n fighters. Fighter i has a
rating of a_i .

Eralim arranges a tournament of n - 1 battles, in each of which two not yet
eliminated fighters i and j (1 \le i < j \le n ) are chosen, and as a result
of the battle, fighter i is eliminated from the tournament, and the rating of
fighter j is reduced by the rating of fighter i . That is, a_j is decreased by
a_i . Note that fighter j 's rating can become negative. The fighters indexes
do not change.

Eralim wants to know what maximum rating the last remaining fighter can
preserve if he chooses the battles optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of fighters.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the ratings of the fighters.

The sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum rating that the last
remaining fighter can preserve.

Note

In the first example, you can arrange a fight between fighters with indices 1
and 2 , where the fighter with index 2 will win. The rating of the last
fighter, that is, the fighter with index 2 , will be 1 - 2 = -1 .

In the second example, you can first conduct a fight between fighters with
indices 1 and 2 , where the fighter with index 2 will win, and then conduct a
fight between fighters with indices 2 and 3 , where the fighter with index 3
will win.

The rating of the fighter with index 2 after the first fight will be 2 - 2 = 0
. The rating of the fighter with index 3 after the second fight will be 8 - 0
= 8 .
