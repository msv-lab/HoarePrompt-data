Artem wrote the digit d on the board exactly n! times in a row. So, he got the
number dddddd \dots ddd (exactly n! digits).

Now he is curious about which odd digits from 1 to 9 divide the number written
on the board.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of
test cases. The next t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and d (2
\le n \le 10^9 , 1 \le d \le 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output the odd digits in ascending order that divide the
number written on the board.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 6
    
    7 1
    
    8 5

Output

    1 3 
    1 3 7 9 
    1 3 5 7 9 
    
Note

The factorial of a positive integer n (n! ) is the product of all integers
from 1 to n . For example, the factorial of 5 is 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4
\cdot 5 = 120 .
