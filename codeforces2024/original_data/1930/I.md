You are given a binary^\dagger pattern p of length n .

A binary string q of the same length n is called good if for every i (1 \leq i
\leq n ), there exist indices l and r such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq n , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_lq_{l+1}\ldots q_r . 

Count the number of good binary strings modulo 998\,244\,353 .

^\dagger A binary string is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5 ) â€” the
length of the binary string p .

The second line of input contains a binary string p of length n consisting of
characters 0 and 1.

Output

Output the number of good strings modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the second example, the good strings are

  * \mathtt{010} ; 
  * \mathtt{011} ; 
  * \mathtt{101} ; 
  * \mathtt{110} ; 
  * \mathtt{111} .
