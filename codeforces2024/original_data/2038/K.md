You have an n \times n grid and two integers a and b . Both the rows and the
columns are numbered from 1 to n . Let's denote the cell at the intersection
of the i -th row and the j -th column as (i, j) .

You are standing in the cell (1, 1) and want to move into the cell (n, n) .

Suppose you are in the cell (i, j) ; in one step, you can move either into the
cell (i, j + 1) or into the cell (i + 1, j) if the corresponding cells exist.

Let's define the cost of the cell (i, j) as c(i, j) = \gcd(i, a) + \gcd(j, b)
(here, \gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor of x and y ). The cost of
the route from (1, 1) to (n, n) is the sum of costs of the visited cells
(including the starting cell and the finishing cell).

Find the route with minimum possible cost and print its cost.

Input

The only line contains three integers n , a , and b (2 \le n \le 10^6 ; 1 \le
a, b \le 10^6 ).

Output

Print one integer â€” the cost of the cheapest route from (1, 1) to (n, n) .
