This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions are the allowed characters in s . In the easy version, s only
contains the character ?. You can make hacks only if both versions of the
problem are solved.

You are given a permutation p of length n . You are also given a string s of
length n , consisting only of the character ?.

For each i from 1 to n :

  * Define l_i as the largest index j < i such that p_j > p_i . If there is no such index, l_i := i . 
  * Define r_i as the smallest index j > i such that p_j > p_i . If there is no such index, r_i := i . 

Initially, you have an undirected graph with n vertices (numbered from 1 to n
) and no edges. Then, for each i from 1 to n , add one edge to the graph:

  * If s_i = L, add the edge (i, l_i) to the graph. 
  * If s_i = R, add the edge (i, r_i) to the graph. 
  * If s_i = ?, either add the edge (i, l_i) or the edge (i, r_i) to the graph at your choice. 

Find the maximum possible diameter^{\text{∗}} over all connected graphs that
you can form. Output -1 if it is not possible to form any connected graphs.

^{\text{∗}} Let d(s, t) denote the smallest number of edges on any path
between s and t .

The diameter of the graph is defined as the maximum value of d(s, t) over all
pairs of vertices s and t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 4
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1,p_2,\ldots, p_n (1
\le p_i \le n ) — the elements of p , which are guaranteed to form a
permutation.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n . It is
guaranteed that it consists only of the character ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 4 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible diameter over all connected
graphs that you form, or -1 if it is not possible to form any connected
graphs.

Note

In the first test case, here are some possible connected graphs that you can
form (the labels are indices):

In the second test case, the only connected graph has a diameter of 1 .
