You are given a tree with n vertices.

You need to construct an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n , consisting
of unique integers from 1 to 2 \cdot n , and such that for each edge u_i
\leftrightarrow v_i of the tree, the value |a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}| is not a prime
number.

Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no
such array.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

The next n - 1 lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The i
-th line contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \le u_i, v_i \le n ; u_i \neq
v_i ), denoting the edge between the nodes u_i and v_i .

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print
its elements a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Otherwise, print -1 .

corresponding elements of the array a are written in them.
