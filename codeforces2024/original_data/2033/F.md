Kosuke is too lazy. He will not give you any legend, just the task:

Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

  * f(1)=f(2)=1 . 
  * f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) (3\le n) 

We denote G(n,k) as an index of the n -th Fibonacci number that is divisible
by k . For given n and k , compute G(n,k) .

As this number can be too big, output it by modulo 10^9+7 .

For example: G(3,2)=9 because the 3 -rd Fibonacci number that is divisible by
2 is 34 . [1,1,\textbf{2},3,5,\textbf{8},13,21,\textbf{34}] .

Input

The first line of the input data contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4
) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 10^{18} , 1
\le k \le 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, output the only number: the value G(n,k) taken by modulo
10^9+7 .
