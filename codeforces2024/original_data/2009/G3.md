This is the extreme version of the problem. In this version, the output of
each query is different from the easy and hard versions. It is also guaranteed
that r \geq l+k-1 for all queries.

For an arbitrary array b , Yunli can perform the following operation any
number of times:

  * Select an index i . Set b_i = x where x is any integer she desires (x is not limited to the interval [1,n] ). 

Denote f(b) as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until
there exists a consecutive subarray^{\text{∗}} of length at least k in b .

Yunli is given an array a of size n and asks you q queries. In each query, you
must output \sum_{i=l}^{r-k+1} \sum_{j=i+k-1}^{r} f([a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots,
a_j]) .

^{\text{∗}} If there exists a consecutive subarray of length k that starts at
index i (1 \leq i \leq |b|-k+1 ), then b_j = b_{j-1} + 1 for all i < j \leq
i+k-1 .

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q (1 \leq
k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the
array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries.

The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \leq a_i \leq n
).

The following q lines contain two integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , r
\geq l+k-1 ) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output \sum_{i=l}^{r-k+1} \sum_{j=i+k-1}^{r} f([a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j])
for each query on a new line.

Note

In the first query of the first testcase, we can calculate the answer for the
query through the following:

  * i = 4 and j = 5 : f([2, 1])=1 because Yunli can set b_2=3 , making a consecutive subarray of size 2 in 1 move. 
  * i = 4 and j = 6 : f([2, 1, 2])=0 because there is already a consecutive array of size 2 . 
  * i = 5 and j = 6 : f([1, 2])=0 because there is already a consecutive array of size 2 . 

The answer to this query is 1+0+0=1 .
