This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed
that r \geq l+k-1 for all queries.

For an arbitrary array b , Yunli can perform the following operation any
number of times:

  * Select an index i . Set b_i = x where x is any integer she desires (x is not limited to the interval [1,n] ). 

Denote f(b) as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until
there exists a consecutive subarray^{\text{∗}} of length at least k in b .

Yunli is given an array a of size n and asks you q queries. In each query, you
must output \sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_j]) .

^{\text{∗}} If there exists a consecutive subarray of length k that starts at
index i (1 \leq i \leq |b|-k+1 ), then b_j = b_{j-1} + 1 for all i < j \leq
i+k-1 .

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q (1 \leq
k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the
array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries.

The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \leq a_i \leq n
).

The following q lines contain two integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , r
\geq l+k-1 ) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output \sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_j]) for each query on a
new line.

Note

In the second query of the first testcase, we calculate the following function
values:

  * f([2,3,2,1,2])=3 because Yunli can set b_3=4 , b_4=5 , and b_5=6 , making a consecutive subarray of size 5 in 3 moves. 
  * f([2,3,2,1,2,3])=2 because we can set b_3=0 and b_2=-1 , making a consecutive subarray of size 5 in 2 moves (starting at position 2 ) 

The answer to this query is 3+2=5 .
