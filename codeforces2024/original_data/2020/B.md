Imagine you have n light bulbs numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, all bulbs
are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on,
and to turn it on otherwise.

Next, you do the following:

  * for each i = 1, 2, \ldots, n , flip the state of all bulbs j such that j is divisible by i^\dagger . 

After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still
on. Your goal is to make this number exactly k .

Find the smallest suitable n such that after performing the operations there
will be exactly k bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.

^\dagger An integer x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that
x = y\cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer k (1 \le k \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each test case, output n â€” the minimum number of bulbs.

Note

In the first test case, the minimum number of bulbs is 2 . Let's denote the
state of all bulbs with an array, where 1 corresponds to a turned on bulb, and
0 corresponds to a turned off bulb. Initially, the array is [1, 1] .

  * After performing the operation with i = 1 , the array becomes [\underline{0}, \underline{0}] . 
  * After performing the operation with i = 2 , the array becomes [0, \underline{1}] . 

In the end, there are k = 1 bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot
be less than 2 .

In the second test case, the minimum number of bulbs is 5 . Initially, the
array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] .

  * After performing the operation with i = 1 , the array becomes [\underline{0}, \underline{0}, \underline{0}, \underline{0}, \underline{0}] . 
  * After performing the operation with i = 2 , the array becomes [0, \underline{1}, 0, \underline{1}, 0] . 
  * After performing the operation with i = 3 , the array becomes [0, 1, \underline{1}, 1, 0] . 
  * After performing the operation with i = 4 , the array becomes [0, 1, 1, \underline{0}, 0] . 
  * After performing the operation with i = 5 , the array becomes [0, 1, 1, 0, \underline{1}] . 

In the end, there are k = 3 bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot
be smaller than 5 .
