This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this
version k \le n . You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are
solved.

Given a w \times h rectangle on the Oxy plane, with points (0, 0) at the
bottom-left and (w, h) at the top-right of the rectangle.

You also have a robot initially at point (0, 0) and a script s of n
characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to
move left, right, up, or down respectively.

The robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the
script s as follows:

  * If it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's). 
  * If it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's). 

Then, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it
couldn't execute.

An example of the robot's movement process, s = \texttt{"ULULURD"}

The script s will be executed for k times continuously. All changes to the
string s will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how
many times will the robot move to the point (0, 0) in total? Note that the
initial position does NOT count.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , k , w , and h (1
\le n, w, h \le 10^6 ; 1 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains a single string s of size n (s_i \in \\{\texttt{L},
\texttt{R}, \texttt{U}, \texttt{D}\\} ) — the script to be executed.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot
reaches (0, 0) when executing script s for k times continuously.

Note

In the first test case, the robot only moves up and right. In the end, it
occupies the position (2, 2) but never visits (0, 0) . So the answer is 0 .

In the second test case, each time executing the script the robot visits the
origin twice. And since k=2 , it visits the origin 2 \cdot 2 = 4 times
overall.
