Cube is given an integer n . She wants to know how many ordered pairs of
positive integers (a,b) there are such that a=n-b . Since Cube is not very
good at math, please help her!

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 99 ) â€” the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs (a, b) on a new line.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    4
    
    6

Output

    1
    3
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, the only ordered pair that works is (a,b)=(1,1) .

In the second test case, the three ordered pairs of (a,b) that work are (3,1),
(2,2), (1,3) .
