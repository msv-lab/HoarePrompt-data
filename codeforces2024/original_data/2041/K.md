In an interdisciplinary collaboration, an ecosystem scientist and a computer
scientist join forces to analyze the structure of a complex ecosystem using
computational methods. The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a
directed graph D = (V, A) , where each species is represented by a node v \in
V , and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge (x, y) \in
A from prey x to predator y . This graph structure allows them to simulate the
flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.

Two essential features of the ecosystem are defined:

  * Independent Trophic Group: A set S of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species x \in S can reach another species y \in S (for some y \ne x ) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in D from x to y .

  * Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in D , excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in D , excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem. 

Consider an ecosystem with n = 4 species and m = 3 feeding relationships:

  * Species 1: Grass (Node 1) 
  * Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2) 
  * Species 3: Foxes (Node 3) 
  * Species 4: Hawks (Node 4) 

The directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:

  * (1, 2) : Grass is eaten by Rabbits. 
  * (2, 3) : Rabbits are eaten by Foxes. 
  * (2, 4) : Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks. 

Now, consider the set S=\\{3,4\\} (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed
paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and
Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set
qualifies as an independent trophic group.

Examination of Species

  * Species 1 (Grass): 
    * Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks) 
    * Can be reached by: 0 (None) 
    * Absolute difference: |3 - 0| = 3 

  * Species 2 (Rabbits):

    * Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks) 
    * Can be reached by: 1 (Grass) 
    * Absolute difference: |2 - 1| = 1 
  * Species 3 (Foxes):

    * Can reach: 0 (None) 
    * Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits) 
    * Absolute difference: |0-2| = 2 
  * Species 4 (Hawks):

    * Can reach: 0 (None) 
    * Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits) 
    * Absolute difference: |0-2| = 2 

Among these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of 1 ,
indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem.

It is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of
at most k . The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the
ecosystem.

Input

The first line contains exactly two integers n and m , where n (resp. m )
denotes the number of nodes (resp. edges) in the directed graph D induced by
the investigated ecosystem. The nodes are numbered as 1, 2, \ldots, n . Then,
m lines follow. The i -th line contains two integers x_i and y_i indicating a
directed edge from node x_i to node y_i .

  * 1 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5 
  * 0 \le m \le \min\\{ n(n-1), 4 \times 10^5\\} 
  * k is not an input value, and it is guaranteed that 1 \le k \le 16 for each investigated ecosystem. 
  * For all i (1\le i\le m ), 1\le x_i, y_i\le n and x_i\neq y_i . 
  * Each ordered pair (x_i, y_i) appears at most once in the input. 

Output

Output on a single line the node identidiers of all trophic balance species in
ascending order. For any two consecutive node identifiers, separate them by a
space.
