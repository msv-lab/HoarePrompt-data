Boxed meals in Taiwan are very common, offering convenient and affordable
nutrition-balanced choices for students and office workers. These meals
typically include a variety of vegetables, protein, and rice, providing a
well-rounded diet. With numerous options available at local self-service
restaurants, they are a popular choice for those looking for a quick, healthy
lunch.

There are five Taiwanese self-service restaurants numbered from 1 to 5. You
plan to visit a different restaurant each day from Monday to Friday to pack a
boxed meal for lunch. You've already visited one restaurant from Monday to
Thursday, each time visiting a different one. Now, it's Friday, and you want
to visit the last remaining restaurant that you haven't been to yet this week.

Write a program that takes as input the four restaurants you've already
visited (one for each day from Monday to Thursday) and outputs the restaurant
you should visit on Friday.

Input
