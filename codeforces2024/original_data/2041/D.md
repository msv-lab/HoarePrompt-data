You are given a two-dimensional maze with a start and end position. Your task
is to find the fastest way to get from the start to the end position. The
fastest way is to make the minimum number of steps where one step is going
left, right, up, or down. Of course, you cannot walk through walls.

There is, however, a catch: If you make more than three steps in the same
direction, you lose balance and fall down. Therefore, it is forbidden to make
more than three consecutive steps in the same direction. It is okay to walk
three times to the right, then one step to the left, and then again three
steps to the right. This has the same effect as taking five steps to the
right, but is slower.

Input

The first line contains two numbers n and m , which are the height and width
of the maze. This is followed by an ASCII-representation of the maze where
\tt{\\#} is a wall, \tt{.} is an empty space, and \tt S and \tt T are the
start and end positions.

  * 12 \leq n\times m \leq 200000 . 
  * 3\leq n,m \leq 10000 . 
  * Characters are only \tt{.\\#ST} and there is exactly one \tt{S} and one \tt{T} . 
  * The outer borders are only \tt{\\#} (walls). 

Output

The minimum number of steps to reach the end position from the start position
or -1 if that is impossible.
