        "description": "Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments\nm_1, m_2, \\dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his\nphone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned\non.\n\nThe phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any\nmoment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action\nconsumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be\ninstantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the\nsame moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone\nat the same moment.\n\nIf at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \\le 0 ), it is impossible\nto send a message at that moment.\n\nSince all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can\nsend all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) —\nthe number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test\ncases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1\n\\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\le f, a, b \\le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,\nthe initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the\nconsumption when turned off and on sequentially.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n (1\n\\le m_i \\le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to\nbe sent.\n\nIt is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if Stepan can send all the messages, and \"NO\"\notherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,\nthe strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive\nanswer.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    1 3 1 5\n    \n    3\n    \n    7 21 1 3\n    \n    4 6 10 13 17 20 26\n    \n    5 10 1 2\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n    \n    1000000000\n    \n    3 11 9 6\n    \n    6 8 10\n    \n    12 621526648 2585904 3566299\n    \n    51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683\n\nOutput\n\n    NO\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    NO\n    YES\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .\nWhen sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \\cdot 1 = 3\nunits of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and\nStepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the\nphone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the\nmessage in this way.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10\n. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and\non, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions\ncan be taken:\n\n  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; \n  * send a message at moment 1 ; \n  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \\cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; \n  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; \n  * send a message at moment 3 ; \n  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; \n  * send a message at moment 4 ; \n  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; \n  * send a message at moment 5 . \n\nThe last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer\noverflow in your solution.",

Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum\nstrength from the mushrooms.\n\nThe strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms\nin it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to\nstay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for\ngathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of\nmushrooms.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from\n1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is\nnot a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a\npermutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le\n200\\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.\n\nThe second line contains an array v of size n (1\\le v_i \\le 10^9 ) — the magic\npowers of the mushrooms.\n\nThe third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2\\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum\nstrength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms\nthat Kirill needs to use for this.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    9 8 14\n    \n    3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    \n    6 5 4 3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 4 6 10 10\n    \n    2 1 4 5 3\n    \n    4\n    \n    2 2 5 5\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 9 10 10\n    \n    1 4 2 3 5\n\nOutput\n\n    16 2\n    9 3\n    8 2\n    20 2\n    5 1\n    20 2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so\nthe strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \\cdot \\min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \\cdot\n\\min(9, 8) = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16 .

        "description": "Finally, lunchtime!\n\nn schoolchildren have lined up in a long queue at the cook's tent for\nporridge. The cook will be serving porridge for D minutes. The schoolchild\nstanding in the i -th position in the queue has a priority of k_i and eats one\nportion of porridge in s_i minutes.\n\nAt the beginning of each minute of the break, the cook serves the first\nschoolchild in the queue one portion of porridge, after which the schoolchild\ngoes to eat their portion. If the i -th schoolchild is served a portion at the\nbeginning of the x -th minute, then they will return to the queue at the end\nof the (x + s_i) -th minute.\n\nWhen the i -th schoolchild returns to the queue, the schoolchildren at the end\nof the queue whose priority is strictly lower than that of the i -th\nschoolchild must let them pass. Thus, they will stand in the queue behind the\nlast schoolchild whose priority is not lower than their own. That is, behind\nthe last schoolchild j with k_j \\ge k_i . If there is no such schoolchild in\nthe queue, the i -th schoolchild will stand at the front of the queue.\n\nIf several schoolchildren return at the same time, they will return to the\nqueue in ascending order of their s_i .\n\nFor example, if n = 3 , D = 3 , k = [2, 3, 2] , and s = [2, 1, 3] , the\nserving will occur as follows:\n\n  * At the beginning of minute 1 , the students in the queue are [1, 2, 3] , and student 1 is served porridge; \n  * at the beginning of minute 2 , the students in the queue are [2, 3] , and student 2 is served porridge; \n  * at the beginning of minute 3 , the student in the queue is [3] , and student 3 is served porridge; \n  * at the end of minute 3 , student 2 returns to the queue, and the queue becomes [2] ; \n  * at the end of minute 3 , student 1 returns to the queue, and the queue becomes [2, 1] , as his priority is lower. \n\nDetermine the minimum number of minutes after the start of the break that each\nschoolchild will receive porridge at least once, or report that this will not\nhappen within D minutes.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by\na description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and D (1 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\le D \\le 3\\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of schoolchildren in the\nqueue and the break time, respectively.\n\nThe next n lines contain two integers k_i and s_i (1 \\le k_i, s_i, \\le 10^9 )\n— the priority and the time to eat one portion of porridge for the respective\nschoolchild. The schoolchildren are given in the order they stand in the queue\n(from the front to the end).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all input data sets does\nnot exceed 2\\cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the\nvalues of D for all input data sets does not exceed 3\\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of minutes after which each\nschoolchild will receive porridge at least once. If this does not happen\nwithin the break time, output -1 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    5 10\n    \n    10 3\n    \n    7 1\n    \n    11 3\n    \n    5 1\n    \n    6 1\n    \n    5 20\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    7 2\n    \n    8 5\n    \n    1 5\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    5 17\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    8 2\n    \n    8 3\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    5 14\n    \n    8 2\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    8 3\n    \n    6 4\n    \n    1 11\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    5 14\n    \n    8 2\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    1 3\n    \n    8 3\n    \n    6 4\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    -1\n    12\n    6\n    6\n    1\n    6",

The road\nalso may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the\nentire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.\n\nTo make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half\nof the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.\nThat is, among x residents on one side, at least \\lceil\\frac{x}{2}\\rceil\nshould want to live on that side, where \\lceil x \\rceil denotes rounding up a\nreal number x .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)\nTo the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j\nthere must be at least \\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\rceil zeros.

We can show that the answer always exists.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    3\n    \n    101\n    \n    6\n    \n    010111\n    \n    6\n    \n    011001\n    \n    3\n    \n    000\n    \n    3\n    \n    110\n    \n    3\n    \n    001\n    \n    4\n    \n    1100\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    3\n    2\n    3\n    0\n    1\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nLet's consider the first example of input data.\n\nIf we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on\nthe left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the\nright side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be\nsatisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after\nhouse 1 .\n\nIf we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left\nside (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the\nright side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More\nthan half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which\nmeans that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the\noptimal answer.",

To do this, he needs to give her an engagement ring.\nHowever, his girlfriend does not like such romantic gestures, but she does\nlike binary search trees^{\\dagger} . So Sasha decided to give her such a tree.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time on wedding websites for programmers, he found the\nperfect binary search tree with the root at vertex 1 . In this tree, the value\nat vertex v is equal to val_v .\n\nBut after some time, he forgot the values in some vertices. Trying to remember\nthe found tree, Sasha wondered — how many binary search trees could he have\nfound on the website, if it is known that the values in all vertices are\nintegers in the segment [1, C] . Since this number can be very large, output\nit modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\n^{\\dagger} A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree in which for any\nvertex x , the following property holds: the values of all vertices in the\nleft subtree of vertex x (if it exists) are less than or equal to the value at\nvertex x , and the values of all vertices in the right subtree of vertex x (if\nit exists) are greater than or equal to the value at vertex x .\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

The i -th line contains\nthree integers L_i, R_i and val_i (-1 \\le L_i, R_i \\le n , -1 \\le val_i \\le C\n, L_i, R_i, val_i \\ne 0 ) — the number of the left child, the number of the\nright child, and the value at the i -th vertex, respectively. If L_i = -1 ,\nthen the i -th vertex has no left son. If R_i = -1 , then the i -th vertex has\nno right son. If val_i = -1 , then the value at the i -th vertex is unknown.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one suitable binary search tree exists.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of suitable binary\nsearch trees modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    2 3 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 2\n    \n    4 -1 3\n    \n    -1 5 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n    \n    3 69\n    \n    2 3 47\n    \n    -1 -1 13\n    \n    -1 -1 69\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 3 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n    \n    -1 -1 -1\n\nOutput\n\n    4\n    1\n    10\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the binary search tree has the following form:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/602b54b45d686037e402a803f6366451493d4f00.png)\n\nThen the possible values at the vertices are: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2] , [2, 2, 3, 2,\n3] , [2, 2, 3, 3, 3] , and [3, 2, 3, 3, 3] .\n\nIn the second test case, the values at all vertices are known, so there is\nonly one suitable binary search tree.",

You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nThomas is sailing around an island surrounded by the ocean. The ocean and\nisland can be represented by a grid with n rows and m columns. The rows are\nnumbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\nto m from left to right. The position of a cell at row r and column c can be\nrepresented as (r, c) . Below is an example of a valid grid.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/95bf34ca1201ffd49c650e2eab82db74ca137561.png)\nExample of a valid grid\n\nThere are three types of cells: island, ocean and underwater volcano. Cells\nrepresenting the island are marked with a '#', cells representing the ocean\nare marked with a '.', and cells representing an underwater volcano are marked\nwith a 'v'. It is guaranteed that there is at least one island cell and at\nleast one underwater volcano cell. It is also guaranteed that the set of all\nisland cells forms a single connected component^{\\dagger} and the set of all\nocean cells and underwater volcano cells forms a single connected component.\nAdditionally, it is guaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of\nthe grid (that is, at row 1 , at row n , at column 1 , and at column m ).\n\nDefine a round trip starting from cell (x, y) as a path Thomas takes which\nsatisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * The path starts and ends at (x, y) . \n  * If Thomas is at cell (i, j) , he can go to cells (i+1, j) , (i-1, j) , (i, j-1) , and (i, j+1) as long as the destination cell is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell and is still inside the grid. Note that it is allowed for Thomas to visit the same cell multiple times in the same round trip. \n  * The path must go around the island and fully encircle it. Some path p fully encircles the island if it is impossible to go from an island cell to a cell on the grid border by only traveling to adjacent on a side or diagonal cells without visiting a cell on path p . In the image below, the path starting from (2, 2) , going to (1, 3) , and going back to (2, 2) the other way does not fully encircle the island and is not considered a round trip. \n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/fbd907724a3f8d94b6d6922444a30df89276270c.png)\nExample of a path that does not fully encircle the island\n\nThe safety of a round trip is the minimum Manhattan distance^{\\ddagger} from a\ncell on the round trip to an underwater volcano (note that the presence of\nisland cells does not impact this distance).\n\nYou have q queries. A query can be represented as (x, y) and for every query,\nyou want to find the maximum safety of a round trip starting from (x, y) . It\nis guaranteed that (x, y) is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell.\n\n^{\\dagger} A set of cells forms a single connected component if from any cell\nof this set it is possible to reach any other cell of this set by moving only\nthrough the cells of this set, each time going to a cell with a common side.\n\n^{\\ddagger} Manhattan distance between cells (r_1, c_1) and (r_2, c_2) is\nequal to |r_1 - r_2| + |c_1 - c_2| .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n , m , and q (3 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5 ,\n9 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\leq q \\leq 5 ) — the number of rows\nand columns of the grid and the number of queries.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains m characters describing the cells of\nthe grid. The character '#' denotes an island cell, '.' denotes an ocean cell,\nand 'v' denotes an underwater volcano cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one island cell and at least one\nunderwater volcano cell. It is guaranteed that the set of all island cells\nforms a single connected component and the set of all ocean cells and\nunderwater volcano cells forms a single connected component. Also, it is\nguaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of the grid (that is, at\nthe row 1 , at the row n , at the column 1 , and at the column m ).\n\nThe following q lines describe the queries. Each of these lines contains two\nintegers x and y (1 \\leq x \\leq n , 1 \\leq y \\leq m ) denoting a round trip\nstarting from (x, y) .\n\nIt is guaranteed that (x, y) is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output a single integer — the maximum safety of a round trip\nstarting from the specified position.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    9 9 3\n    .........\n    .........\n    ....###..\n    ...v#....\n    ..###....\n    ...##...v\n    ...##....\n    .........\n    v........\n    1 1\n    9 1\n    5 7\n    \nOutput\n\n    3\n    0\n    3\n    \nInput\n\n    3 3 5\n    ..v\n    .#.\n    ...\n    1 2\n    1 3\n    2 3\n    2 1\n    3 2\n    \nOutput\n\n    0\n    0\n    0\n    0\n    0\n    \nInput\n\n    14 13 5\n    .............\n    .............\n    .............\n    ...vvvvvvv...\n    ...v.....v...\n    ...v.###.v...\n    ...v.#.#.v...\n    ...v..v..v...\n    ...v..v..v...\n    ....v...v....\n    .....vvv.....\n    .............\n    .............\n    .............\n    1 1\n    7 7\n    5 6\n    4 10\n    13 6\n    \nOutput\n\n    3\n    0\n    1\n    0\n    2\n    \nInput\n\n    10 11 4\n    ...........\n    ..#######..\n    ..#..#..#..\n    ..#.....#..\n    ..#..v..#..\n    ..#.###.#..\n    ..#.#.#.#..\n    ..#...#.#..\n    ..#####.#..\n    ...........\n    7 6\n    3 7\n    6 8\n    1 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    \nNote\n\nFor the first example, the image below shows an optimal round trip starting\nfrom (1, 1) .

The state of cell (i,j) can be described using the integer\na_{i,j} :\n\n  * If a_{i,j} = 1 , there is a rock at (i,j) . \n  * If a_{i,j} = 0 , there is nothing at (i,j) . \n\nAs a result of aftershocks from the earthquake, the columns follow tectonic\nplate movements: each column moves cyclically upwards at a velocity of 1 cell\nper unit of time. Formally, for some 0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m , if (i,j)\ncontains a rock at the moment, it will move from (i, j) to (i - 1, j) (or to\n(n - 1, j) if i=0 ).\n\nThe robot called RT is initially positioned at (0,0) . It has to go to\n(n-1,m-1) to carry out an earthquake rescue operation (to the bottom rightmost\ncell). The earthquake doesn't change the position of the robot, they only\nchange the position of rocks in the world.\n\nLet RT's current position be (x,y) (0 \\le x < n, 0 \\le y < m ), it can perform\nthe following operations:\n\n  * Go one cell cyclically upwards, i.e. from (x,y) to ((x+n-1) \\bmod n, y) using 1 unit of time. \n  * Go one cell cyclically downwards, i.e. (x,y) to ((x+1) \\bmod n, y) using 1 unit of time. \n  * Go one cell to the right, i.e. (x,y) to (x, y+1) using 1 unit of time. (RT may perform this operation only if y < m-1 .) \n\nNote that RT cannot go left using the operations nor can he stay at a\nposition.\n\nUnfortunately, RT will explode upon colliding with a rock. As such, when RT is\nat (x,y) and there is a rock at ((x+1) \\bmod n, y) or ((x+2) \\bmod n, y) , RT\ncannot move down or it will be hit by the rock.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/54b91480f21e9db9b3082078e8c3f561bbc98d16.png)\n\nSimilarly, if y+1 < m and there is a rock at ((x+1) \\bmod n, y+1) , RT cannot\nmove right or it will be hit by the rock.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/fc36b41ba5b0aaf6e7cb0cd14e3d7753ff8ce551.png)\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that if there is a rock at (x \\bmod n, y+1) and\n((x+1) \\bmod n, y) , RT can still move right safely.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/aea04e7014e8732ae282cc6fc1cc10e0bcf293db.png)\n\nFind the minimum amount of time RT needs to reach (n-1,m-1) without colliding\nwith any rocks. If it is impossible to do so, output -1 .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the\nnumber of test cases.\n\nIn each test case, the first line contains two integers n , m (3 \\le n, m \\le\n10^3 ) — the size of the planet's boundaries.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains m integers. The (j+1) -th integer on the\n(i+1) -th line (0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m ) is a_{i,j} (0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 1 ),\nwhich denotes whether or not there is a rock at (i,j) at time 0 .\n\nAdditionally, it is guaranteed that a_{0,0} = 0 , and a_{i, m-1} = 0 for 0 \\le\ni < n . In other words, there is no rock at RT's initial position as well as\ncolumn m-1 .\n\nThe sum of n \\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case:\n\n  * If the destination can be reached without colliding with any rocks, output a single integer — the minimum amount of time RT needs to reach (n-1,m-1) . \n  * Otherwise, output -1 . \n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    4 5\n    \n    0 1 0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0\n    \n    1 0 1 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    3 7\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    3 4\n    \n    0 1 0 0\n    \n    1 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0 1 0\n\nOutput\n\n    7\n    3\n    3\n    8\n    -1\n    12\n    \nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    1 0 0\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    1 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 0\n    \n    5 5\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0 0\n    \n    0 1 1 0 0\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    3\n    -1\n    -1\n    3\n    8\n    \nNote\n\nVisual explanation of the first test case in the example:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/637212bb29cbbd910ef8e78f64b0fc4890aa4872.png)",

Each cell\ncan either be empty or have a single fortune cookie of one of the following\nshapes: circle or square. The cell at the intersection of the a -th row and\nthe b -th column is denoted as (a, b) .\n\nInitially, the entire grid is empty. Then, Alice performs q operations on the\nfortune cookie box. The i -th operation (1 \\le i \\le q ) is as follows:\nspecify a currently empty cell (r_i,c_i) and a shape (circle or square), then\nput a fortune cookie of the specified shape on cell (r_i,c_i) . Note that\nafter the i -th operation, the cell (r_i,c_i) is no longer empty.\n\nBefore all operations and after each of the q operations, Alice wonders what\nthe number of ways to place fortune cookies in all remaining empty cells is,\nsuch that the following condition is satisfied:\n\nNo three consecutive cells (in horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal\ndirections) contain cookies of the same shape. Formally:\n\n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i,j+1), (i,j+2) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j+2) . \n  * There does not exist any (i,j) satisfying 1 \\le i \\le n-2, 1 \\le j \\le m-2 , such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells (i,j+2), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j) . \n\nYou should output all answers modulo 998\\,244\\,353 .

Today, although\nBob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy\nexactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each\ncontaining an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each\nstall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .\n\nFortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,\nbuy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as\npossible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the\nnumber of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that\nAlice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is\nimpossible to do so.\n\nNote that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nEach test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{18}\n) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to\nhave bought at the end.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print on one line \"YES\" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls\nand set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or\n\"NO\" if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIf the answer is \"YES\", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \\le s \\le 60\n) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s\npositive integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_s (1 \\le p_i \\le 10^{18}) that represent\nsuch a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .\nIf there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    7 3\n    \n    6 4\n    \n    255 8\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    10\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n    NO\n    YES\n    8\n    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left\nwith 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining\nstalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.\n\nIn the third test case,\n\n  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. \n  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. \n  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. \n  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. \n  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. \n  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. \n  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. \n  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. \n\nTherefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.",

There are four suits: clubs,\ndiamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',\n'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',\n'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.\n\nEach card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8\nof Hearts is denoted as 8H.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.\n\nIn each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of\nhis cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of\ntheir cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.\n\nA card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first\ncard has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.\nAdditionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank\nof the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat\n9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher\nrank.\n\nThere were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n\ncards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in\nthe discard pile are shuffled.

The i -th candidate has programming skill a_i and testing\nskill b_i (a person's programming skill is different from their testing\nskill). The skill of the team is the sum of the programming skills of all\ncandidates hired as programmers, and the sum of the testing skills of all\ncandidates hired as testers.\n\nWhen a candidate arrives to interview, Monocarp tries to assign them to the\nmost suitable position for them (if their programming skill is higher, then he\nhires them as a programmer, otherwise as a tester). If all slots for that\nposition are filled, Monocarp assigns them to the other position.\n\nYour task is, for each candidate, calculate the skill of the team if everyone\nexcept them comes to interview. Note that it means that exactly n+m candidates\nwill arrive, so all n+m positions in the company will be filled.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the number of\ntest cases.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines:\n\n  * the first line contains two integers n and m (0 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ; 2 \\le n + m + 1 \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of programmers and the number of testers Monocarp wants to hire, respectively; \n  * the second line contains n + m + 1 integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n+m+1} (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 ), where a_i is the programming skill of the i -th candidate; \n  * the third line contains n + m + 1 integers b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_{n+m+1} (1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9 ; b_i \\ne a_i ), where b_i is the testing skill of the i -th candidate. \n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of (n + m + 1) over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print n + m + 1 integers, where the i -th integer should\nbe equal to the skill of the team if everyone except the i -th candidate comes\nto interview.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    \n    1 0\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    0 2\n    \n    4 5 5\n    \n    5 4 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    2 1 5 4\n    \n    5 2 3 1\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    4 3 3 4 1\n    \n    5 5 4 5 2\n\nOutput\n\n    1 2 \n    5 6 9 \n    8 11 11 12 \n    13 13 13 12 15 \n    \nNote\n\nLet's consider the third test case of the example:\n\n  * if the 1 -st candidate does not arrive, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester.

        "description": "You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may\nplay in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a\nplayer switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a\nspecially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.\nThis video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in\nother words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is\nthe same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .\nTherefore, you need to create \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,\none for each possible pair of different scenarios.\n\nEach transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too\nmany funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is\nto create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the\nplayer approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \\lceil\n\\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.\n\nYou have already come up with ideas for at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor of\nthe transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or\nscary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos\nin such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 24 ) — the number of\nscenarios in the game.\n\nThe next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those\nlines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds\nto the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be\nF if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding\ntransition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is\nstill undecided, or . if i=j .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is\nguaranteed that at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded\ndown) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most\n2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as\nthe input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character\nof the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S\nif the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .\n\nEach ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all\nother characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that\nthe i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th\nline are the same for all i and j .\n\nFor each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition\nvideos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more\nthan \\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the\nsame type consecutively.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position.

In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

        "description": "After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of\nthe Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,\noutput NO.\n\nIf the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.\n\nThe next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \\leq x_{i},\ny_{i} \\leq n for each wizard.\n\nThe i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the\nhouse of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If\nthere are multiple such wizards, you can output any.\n\nIf there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    0 4 2 4\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    4 4\n    1 3\n    2 4\n    3 1\n    1 1 1 3\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    1 3 0 1\n    \nOutput\n\n    YES\n    2 1\n    4 1\n    1 1\n    3 1\n    3 3 3 1\n\nNote\n\nFor the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd\nat (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard\nis |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .\n\nThe distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard\nis |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .\n\nThe view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the\nplacement is correct.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/2790cf05cadf5e6334d074a3605416ddb963947f.png)",

After settling the spirits,\nthe Ministry of Magic is looking to renovate the prison to ensure that the\nDementors are kept in check. The prison consists of n prison cells and m bi-\ndirectional corridors. The i^{th} corridor is from cells u_i to v_i . A subset\nof these cells S is called a complex if any cell in S is reachable from any\nother cell in S . Formally, a subset of cells S is a complex if x and y are\nreachable from each other for all x, y \\in S , using only cells from S on the\nway. The funding required for a complex S consisting of k cells is defined as\nk^2 .\n\nAs part of your Intro to Magical Interior Design course at Hogwarts, you have\nbeen tasked with designing the prison. The Ministry of Magic has asked that\nyou divide the prison into 2 complexes with \\textbf{exactly one corridor}\nconnecting them, so that the Dementors can't organize union meetings. For this\npurpose, you are allowed to build bi-directional corridors. The funding\nrequired to build a corridor between any 2 cells is c .\n\nDue to budget cuts and the ongoing fight against the Death Eaters, you must\nfind the \\textbf{minimum total funding} required to divide the prison as per\nthe Ministry's requirements or -1 if no division is possible.\n\nNote: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 complexes\nand the corridors built. If after the division, the two complexes have x and y\ncells respectively and you have built a total of a corridors, the total\nfunding will be x^2 + y^2 + c \\times a .

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger can be present. An other type of ball will be available in the\nharder version of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent a Bludger.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ...

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem,\none Bludger and a Golden Snitch can be present.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player\nis on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or\nthe Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it\nis carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the\nplayer and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs\nwhile the player is in a cell containing a goal.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point. If a player catches the Golden Snitch, their team wins 10\npoints and the game is over.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n  * .B to represent the Bludger. \n  * .S to represent the Golden Snitch.\n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since several balls can be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n  * Each time a player is eliminated, you must print t p ELIMINATED, where t is the current time and p is the player who is eliminated. The format to print the player is the same as in the input. \n  * If the Golden Snitch is caught, you must print t RED CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH or t BLUE CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH, depending on the team who caught the Golden Snitch, where t is the current time.\n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t. If several players are\neliminated at the same time, the events must be written is alphabetical order:\nB0, ..., B9, R0, ...

For example, the\nbalance of the sequence \"(()((\" is 3.\n\nA balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence\nwith balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.\n\nWe define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and\nreturns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the\ninput sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before\nthat character and write those down in a table together with the positions of\nthe characters in the input sequence, for example:\n\nPrefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPosition| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  \nCharacter| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  \n  \nThen, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,\nbreaking ties in decreasing order of position.

She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

The houses\nwill be situated on a picturesque n\\times n square field. Each wizard will\nhave their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house\nwill take up the space of one square.\n\nHowever, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the\nweekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0\n\\leq a_{i} \\leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are\nbuilt horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},\ny_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -\ny_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit\nanother wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built\nwill be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.\n\nApart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle\nin the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other\nwizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each\ncolumn of the n\\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i\n-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \\neq x_{j} for all i\n\\neq j .\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses\nin such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n\nwizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.\n\nIf it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard\nthere is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard\nis the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each\nwizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the\nweekends.\n\nIf it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains n (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses\nto be built.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} (0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n)\n.

Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 3 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

At node 9 with index 3, we again compare the index to the left-child\n           node with value 4. Because the index is the less than the left-child\n           node, we simply traverse to the left.\n \n        3. At node 4 with index 3, we recognize that we are at a leaf node and\n           stop iterating.\n \n        4. To compute the sublist index, we subtract the offset from the index\n           of the leaf node: 5 - 3 = 2. To compute the index in the sublist, we\n           simply use the index remaining from iteration.

After settling the spirits,\nthe Ministry of Magic is looking to renovate the prison to ensure that the\nDementors are kept in check. The prison consists of n prison cells and m bi-\ndirectional corridors. The i^{th} corridor is from cells u_i to v_i . A subset\nof these cells S is called a complex if any cell in S is reachable from any\nother cell in S . Formally, a subset of cells S is a complex if x and y are\nreachable from each other for all x, y \\in S , using only cells from S on the\nway. The funding required for a complex S consisting of k cells is defined as\nk^2 .\n\nAs part of your Intro to Magical Interior Design course at Hogwarts, you have\nbeen tasked with designing the prison. The Ministry of Magic has asked that\nyou divide the prison into 2 complexes with \\textbf{exactly one corridor}\nconnecting them, so that the Dementors can't organize union meetings. For this\npurpose, you are allowed to build bi-directional corridors. The funding\nrequired to build a corridor between any 2 cells is c .\n\nDue to budget cuts and the ongoing fight against the Death Eaters, you must\nfind the \\textbf{minimum total funding} required to divide the prison as per\nthe Ministry's requirements or -1 if no division is possible.\n\nNote: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 complexes\nand the corridors built. If after the division, the two complexes have x and y\ncells respectively and you have built a total of a corridors, the total\nfunding will be x^2 + y^2 + c \\times a . Note that x+y=n .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5 ) — the number of\ntest cases.

        "description": "This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk\noutside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,\nthere is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won\nthe game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to\nget involved in the refereeing of the matches.\n\nNow, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At\nthe end of the game, you will decide the winner.\n\nToday, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw\n(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \\leq P \\leq 10 ).\n\nThe field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \\leq N, M \\leq 99 , N and\nM are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed\nto be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the\nfield contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five\ngoals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be\navailable in the harder versions of the problem.\n\nA game is composed of T steps (0 \\leq T \\leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity\non the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.\nA player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To\ncatch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle\ndoes not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the\nmovements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,\nthe Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.\n\nTo win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.\nWhen it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly\nmoves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the\n(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the\nmiddle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team\nwins the point.\n\nInput\n\nOn the first line, the integers N and M .\n\nThe description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters\nseparated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the\nfield. It can be either:\n\n  * .. to represent an empty cell \n  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. \n  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). \n  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. \n\nThe next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines\nfollow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information\nseparated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that\nmust perform the action. Second, the description of the action:\n\n  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. \n  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. \n  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. \n\nAll the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the\nplayers stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same\ncell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...\n\nOutput\n\nYou must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per\nline. More precisely:\n\n  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. \n\nThe events must be printed in ascending order of t.\n\nAt the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,\nwhere r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n    5 5\n    \n    ..

The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 50 )\n— the number of outcomes.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_n (2\n\\le k_i \\le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome\nturns out to be winning.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as\nrequired. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\\ldots, x_n (1 \\le x_i \\le\n10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.\n\nIt can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that\nsatisfies these constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    3 2 7\n    \n    2\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    5\n    \n    5 5 5 5 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    7 9 3 17 9 13\n    \n    3\n    \n    6 3 2\n    \n    5\n    \n    9 4 6 8 3\n\nOutput\n\n    27 41 12 \n    1 1 \n    -1\n    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 \n    -1\n    8 18 12 9 24\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on\nthe first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third\noutcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =\n80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back\n3 \\cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will\nreceive back 2 \\cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be\nwinning, you will receive back 7 \\cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are\nstrictly greater than 80 .\n\nIn the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.",

To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \\le i \\le\nm , 1 \\le j \\le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,\nhe obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted\ninto the array a ).\n\nTo determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the\nproblems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i\n> 1 ).\n\nWhat is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at\nmost one problem, created according to the described rules?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) —\nthe number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,\nthe number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots a_n\n(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the\nprepared problems.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots d_m\n(1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dots f_k\n(1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf\ncan achieve.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    5 5 5\n    \n    5 10 15 20 26\n    \n    11 14 16 13 8\n    \n    16 4 5 3 1\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 9 3 2\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 13 3 2\n    \n    5 6 3\n    \n    2 10 13 20 25\n    \n    11 6 10 16 14 5\n    \n    6 17 15\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    11 12 14 15\n    \n    19 14\n    \n    10 6\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30\n    \n    9 13 16 15\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 4 7\n    \n    4 21\n    \n    4 15 14 5\n    \n    20 1 15 1 12 5 11\n\nOutput\n\n    5\n    4\n    5\n    8\n    2\n    7\n    11",

The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nLet's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player\ny_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be\nmade to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the\nclockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2\nto 5 is 4 .\n\nInitially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered\nclockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance\nof r_i (1 \\le r_i \\le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if\nthere are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it\na distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player\n(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise).

Rudolf decided to help his\nfriend solve this problem.\n\nThe river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row\nand the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the\ncorresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the\nriver banks, so the depth for them is 0 .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/816a5df3aef86d5882f59471315c4a5e3c241fef.png)\nThe river may look like this.\n\nRudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \\ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over\nit. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost\nof installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be\ninstalled so that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; \n  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; \n  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . \n\nBuilding just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k\nbridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \\le i\n\\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,\n\\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing\nsupports.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3) — the number of\ntest cases.
