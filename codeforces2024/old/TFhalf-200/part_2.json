After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2\n), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from\nthis state —\n\n  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. \n  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. \n  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration. \n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/e7812b315860201676eb89d5690dd84b3eb85862.png)",

The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2\n< \\dots < a_n .\n\nThe distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .\n\nFor each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the\ndistance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each\nother city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,\n20] , then:\n\n  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; \n  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; \n  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; \n  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; \n  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . \n\nThe cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is\nunique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points\n[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1\nand 3 , both having distance 1 ).\n\nYou can travel between cities.

You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; \n  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .",
