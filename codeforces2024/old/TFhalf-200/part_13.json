        "description": "In the new messenger for the students of the Master's Assistance Center,\nKeftemerum, an update is planned, in which developers want to optimize the set\nof messages shown to the user. There are a total of n messages. Each message\nis characterized by two integers a_i and b_i . The time spent reading the set\nof messages with numbers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k (1 \\le p_i \\le n , all p_i are\ndistinct) is calculated by the formula:\n\nNote that the time to read a set of messages consisting of one message with\nnumber p_1 is equal to a_{p_1} . Also, the time to read an empty set of\nmessages is considered to be 0 .\n\nThe user can determine the time l that he is willing to spend in the\nmessenger. The messenger must inform the user of the maximum possible size of\nthe set of messages, the reading time of which does not exceed l . Note that\nthe maximum size of the set of messages can be equal to 0 .\n\nThe developers of the popular messenger failed to implement this function, so\nthey asked you to solve this problem.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and l (1 \\leq n \\leq\n2000 , 1 \\leq l \\leq 10^9 ) — the number of messages and the time the user is\nwilling to spend in the messenger.\n\nThe i -th of the next n lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 \\le a_i,\nb_i \\le 10^9 ) — characteristics of the i -th message.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 4\n\\cdot 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible size of a\nset of messages, the reading time of which does not exceed l .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    5 8\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    1 5\n    \n    2 4\n    \n    4 3\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    1 6\n    \n    4 10\n    \n    3 12\n    \n    4 8\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    2 12\n    \n    5 26\n    \n    24 7\n    \n    8 28\n    \n    30 22\n    \n    3 8\n    \n    17 17\n    \n    5 14\n    \n    15 3\n    \n    1000000000 998244353\n    \n    179 239\n    \n    228 1337\n    \n    993 1007\n\nOutput\n\n    3\n    1\n    2\n    1\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can take a set of three messages with numbers p_1\n= 3 , p_2 = 2 , and p_3 = 5 . The time spent reading this set is equal to a_3\n+ a_2 + a_5 + |b_3 - b_2| + |b_2 - b_5| = 2 + 1 + 2 + |4 - 5| + |5 - 3| = 8 .\n\nIn the second test case, you can take a set of one message with number p_1 = 1\n. The time spent reading this set is equal to a_1 = 4 .\n\nIn the fifth test case, it can be shown that there is no such non-empty set of\nmessages, the reading time of which does not exceed l .",

Note that the solution of this\nproblem may or may not share ideas with the solution of the solo version. You\ncan solve and get points for both versions independently.\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. The game starts with a positive integer n ,\nwith players taking turns. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of\nevents takes place:\n\n  * The player having the integer p breaks it into two integers p_{1} and p_{2} , where 0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . \n  * If no such p_{1} , p_{2} exist, the player loses. \n  * Otherwise, the opponent does either select the integer p_{1} or p_{2} . \n  * The game continues with the selected integer. The opponent will try to break it. \n\nAs Alice, your goal is to win. You can execute a maximum of 63 break\noperations. You have the choice to play first or second. The system will act\nfor Bob.\n\nHere \\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR\noperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a\nsingle integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq\n10^{18} ) — the number the game starts with.\n\nInteraction\n\nFor each test case, the interaction begins by reading the integer n .\n\nAfter reading n , print a single line containing either \"first\" or \"second\",\ndenoting what you want to play as (as first or second correspondingly).\n\nOn Alice's turn, you are required to print two positive integers, p_{1} and\np_{2} such that 0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} =\np . Here, p equals one of the two integers printed by Bob in the previous\nturn. If no turn has occurred previously, p is equal to n . If Alice cannot\nperform a break operation, print \"0 0\" to receive a Wrong answer verdict.\n\nOn Bob's turn, you should read two integers, p_{1} and p_{2} such that 0 \\lt\np_{1} \\lt p , 0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p and p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p . Here, p equals\none of the two integers printed by Alice in the previous turn. If no turn has\noccurred previously, p is equal to n . If Bob cannot perform a break operation\np_{1} = 0 and p_2 = 0 in which case you should proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf any break operation performed by Alice is invalid, the interactor prints\n\"-1 -1\" and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nIf Alice performs 63 turns and Bob can still execute a break operation on the\ncurrent integers, the interactor prints \"-1 -1\", and your code should promptly\nexit to receive a wrong answer verdict.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded.

The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nEach test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{18}\n) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to\nhave bought at the end.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print on one line \"YES\" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls\nand set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or\n\"NO\" if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIf the answer is \"YES\", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \\le s \\le 60\n) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s\npositive integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_s (1 \\le p_i \\le 10^{18}) that represent\nsuch a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .\nIf there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    7 3\n    \n    6 4\n    \n    255 8\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    10\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n    NO\n    YES\n    8\n    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left\nwith 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining\nstalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.\n\nIn the third test case,\n\n  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. \n  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. \n  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. \n  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. \n  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. \n  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. \n  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. \n  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. \n\nTherefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.",

He\nencodes this string using the following algorithm:\n\n  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; \n  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). \n\nFor example, encoding the string s =\"codeforces\" happens as follows:\n\n  * the string r is obtained as \"cdefors\"; \n  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; \n  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; \n  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; \n  * ... \n  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'. \n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b6f889887677396af4d296900b8ca492324e83ef.png)\nThe string r and replacements for s =\"codeforces\".\n\nThus, the result of encoding the string s =\"codeforces\" is the string\n\"serofedsoc\".\n\nWrite a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string\ns from the encoding result.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting\nof lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the\ntest does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was\nobtained.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    10\n    \n    serofedsoc\n    \n    3\n    \n    ttf\n    \n    9\n    \n    tlrhgmaoi\n    \n    1\n    \n    w\n    \n    15\n    \n    hnndledmnhlttin\n\nOutput\n\n    codeforces\n    fft\n    algorithm\n    w\n    meetinthemiddle",
