        "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nFox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,\n\\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \\leq a_i \\leq n for every i . Now they\nare going to play the following game:\n\nFor any two integers l, r such that 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n , define f(l, r) =\n(r - l + 1) \\cdot \\max\\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal\nto the maximum of the subarray a_l, \\ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.\n\nCat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two\nintegers l and x (1 \\leq l \\leq n, 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him\none integer p as the answer — the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,\nr) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.\n\nNow, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence\nc_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \\leq c_1 < \\ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)\n= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \\ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he\nshould indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is\nalways equal to f(1, n) .\n\nIn other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the\narray into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the\nbeginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of\ntheir length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m\nexists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.\n\nCat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.\n\nInteraction\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1\n\\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^4 ) — the length of the hidden array and the number of\nsubarrays in the desired split.\n\nNow you are allowed to make queries in the following way — print one line of\nthe form \"\\mathtt{?} \\ l \\ x \" (it must hold that 1 \\leq l \\leq n , 1 \\leq x\n\\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \\leq r\n\\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.\n\nIf you want to print the answer, output \"\\mathtt{!} \\ m \" and you will recieve\n1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the\ninteraction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer\ndoesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't\nreceive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to\nread whether your answer to the last test case was correct.\n\nIf you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an\ninvalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your\nprogram must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4\n.\n\nHacks\n\nThe format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain\none integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases should follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \\leq k\n\\leq n \\leq 10^4 ) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you\nwant to split it into.\n\nThe second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\leq a_i\n\\leq n ).\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    3\n    1 1\n    \n    1\n    2 2\n    \n    1\n    \n    3\n    \n    1\n    6 3\n    \n    7\n    \n    2\n    \n    3\n    \n    6\n    \n    1\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    ! 1\n    \n    ? 1 1\n    \n    ? 2 1\n    \n    ! -1\n    \n    ? 1 9\n    \n    ? 1 6\n    \n    ? 3 6\n    \n    ? 4 6\n    \n    ! 6\n\nNote\n\nThe hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,\n1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer\nis -1 .\n\nThe answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r\nexists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \\cdot \\max(1, 3) =\n6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.\n\nThe sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so\nit received 1 after each answer.",

For\nexample, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive\nresponses.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    3 2\n    \n    1 2 3\n    \n    -1 2 3\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    -1 1\n    \n    4 10\n    \n    3 4 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 1 3\n    \n    5 3\n    \n    2 1 3 2 5\n    \n    -3 -2 3 4 5\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    1 2\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can act as follows:\n\n  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; \n  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; \n  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. \n\nIn the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of\nthe two monsters during the 1 -st second.
