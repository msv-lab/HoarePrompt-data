        "description": "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value\nof n .\n\nProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to\nprepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string\nconsisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating\ntwo magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its\ndifferent non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is\nequal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and\nXOXO.\n\nEach student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.\nSince the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of\nthe two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided\nby Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a\nstudent chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of\ntheir spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,\nand of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out\nwhich two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.\n\nYour program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n\ndistinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the\nspell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the\ncorrect order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.\n\nInteraction\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nFirst, your program should read a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 30 ), the\nnumber of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has\ncreated, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must\nhave at least 1 and at most 30\\cdot n characters, and each character must be\neither X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \\le i\n\\le n ).\n\nThen, your program should read a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 1000 ), the\nnumber of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process\nq times, one per student.\n\nFor the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power\nof their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two\nindices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n\ninclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of\ndifferent non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program\nmust print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \\le u_j, v_j \\le n ).\n\nNote that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a\nspell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student\nin the exact order.\n\nRemember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after\nprinting u_j and v_j for each student.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nCopy\n\n    2\n    \n    2\n    15\n    \n    11\n\nOutput\n\nCopy\n\n    XOXO\n    X\n    \n    1 1\n    \n    2 1",

Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum\nstrength from the mushrooms.\n\nThe strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms\nin it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the\nelixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.\nKirill can gather mushrooms in any order.\n\nHowever, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation\nof numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic\npower of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .\nKirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.\n\nYour task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew\nthe elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to\nstay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for\ngathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of\nmushrooms.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from\n1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is\nnot a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a\npermutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le\n200\\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.\n\nThe second line contains an array v of size n (1\\le v_i \\le 10^9 ) — the magic\npowers of the mushrooms.\n\nThe third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not\nexceed 2\\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum\nstrength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms\nthat Kirill needs to use for this.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    3\n    \n    9 8 14\n    \n    3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5\n    \n    6\n    \n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    \n    6 5 4 3 2 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 4 6 10 10\n    \n    2 1 4 5 3\n    \n    4\n    \n    2 2 5 5\n    \n    4 2 3 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 2 9 10 10\n    \n    1 4 2 3 5\n\nOutput\n\n    16 2\n    9 3\n    8 2\n    20 2\n    5 1\n    20 2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so\nthe strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \\cdot \\min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \\cdot\n\\min(9, 8) = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16 .

The description\nof the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 10^6\n) — the length of the binary string s .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n\nconsisting of only characters \\mathtt{0} and \\mathtt{1} .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    4\n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    2\n    \n    10\n    \n    5\n    \n    00000\n    \n    20\n    \n    11110110000000111111\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    2\n    0\n    346\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the only \\mathtt{1} -good string is \\mathtt{1} . Thus,\nf(\\mathtt{1})=1 .\n\nIn the second test case, f(\\mathtt{10})=1 because \\mathtt{01} is \\mathtt{10}\n-good, and \\mathtt{00} is not \\mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is\nf(\\mathtt{1})+f(\\mathtt{10})+f(\\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .\n\nIn the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq 5 . Thus,\nthe answer is 0 .",
