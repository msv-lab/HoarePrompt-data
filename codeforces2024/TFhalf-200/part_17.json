        "description": "Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations^{\\dagger} to arrays and finding\nthe most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array a and\ndecided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in\nthe array a that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array a .\n\nMore formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation p_1, p_2, p_3,\n\\ldots, p_n of length n , and then change the elements of the array a\naccording to the rule a_i := a_i + p_i . After that, Vasya counts how many\ntimes each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.\nYou need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.\n\n^{\\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct\nintegers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a\npermutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),\nand [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then\nfollows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2\n\\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1\n\\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements\nequal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    2\n    \n    1 2\n    \n    4\n    \n    7 1 4 1\n    \n    3\n    \n    103 102 104\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 101 1 100 1\n    \n    5\n    \n    1 10 100 1000 1\n    \n    2\n    \n    3 1\n    \n    3\n    \n    1000000000 999999997 999999999\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    2\n    3\n    2\n    1\n    1\n    2\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it is optimal to choose p = [2, 1] . Then after\napplying the operation, the array a will be [3, 3] , in which the number 3\noccurs twice, so the answer is 2 .\n\nIn the second test case, one of the optimal options is p = [2, 3, 1, 4] .\nAfter applying the operation, the array a will be [9, 4, 5, 5] . Since the\nnumber 5 occurs twice, the answer is 2 .",
