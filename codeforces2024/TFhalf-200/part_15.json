You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nThomas is sailing around an island surrounded by the ocean. The ocean and\nisland can be represented by a grid with n rows and m columns. The rows are\nnumbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\nto m from left to right. The position of a cell at row r and column c can be\nrepresented as (r, c) . Below is an example of a valid grid.\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/95bf34ca1201ffd49c650e2eab82db74ca137561.png)\nExample of a valid grid\n\nThere are three types of cells: island, ocean and underwater volcano. Cells\nrepresenting the island are marked with a '#', cells representing the ocean\nare marked with a '.', and cells representing an underwater volcano are marked\nwith a 'v'. It is guaranteed that there is at least one island cell and at\nleast one underwater volcano cell. It is also guaranteed that the set of all\nisland cells forms a single connected component^{\\dagger} and the set of all\nocean cells and underwater volcano cells forms a single connected component.\nAdditionally, it is guaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of\nthe grid (that is, at row 1 , at row n , at column 1 , and at column m ).\n\nDefine a round trip starting from cell (x, y) as a path Thomas takes which\nsatisfies the following conditions:\n\n  * The path starts and ends at (x, y) . \n  * If Thomas is at cell (i, j) , he can go to cells (i+1, j) , (i-1, j) , (i, j-1) , and (i, j+1) as long as the destination cell is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell and is still inside the grid. Note that it is allowed for Thomas to visit the same cell multiple times in the same round trip. \n  * The path must go around the island and fully encircle it. Some path p fully encircles the island if it is impossible to go from an island cell to a cell on the grid border by only traveling to adjacent on a side or diagonal cells without visiting a cell on path p . In the image below, the path starting from (2, 2) , going to (1, 3) , and going back to (2, 2) the other way does not fully encircle the island and is not considered a round trip. \n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/fbd907724a3f8d94b6d6922444a30df89276270c.png)\nExample of a path that does not fully encircle the island\n\nThe safety of a round trip is the minimum Manhattan distance^{\\ddagger} from a\ncell on the round trip to an underwater volcano (note that the presence of\nisland cells does not impact this distance).\n\nYou have q queries. A query can be represented as (x, y) and for every query,\nyou want to find the maximum safety of a round trip starting from (x, y) . It\nis guaranteed that (x, y) is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell.\n\n^{\\dagger} A set of cells forms a single connected component if from any cell\nof this set it is possible to reach any other cell of this set by moving only\nthrough the cells of this set, each time going to a cell with a common side.\n\n^{\\ddagger} Manhattan distance between cells (r_1, c_1) and (r_2, c_2) is\nequal to |r_1 - r_2| + |c_1 - c_2| .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n , m , and q (3 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5 ,\n9 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\leq q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 ) — the number\nof rows and columns of the grid and the number of queries.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains m characters describing the cells of\nthe grid.

It is guaranteed that the set of all island cells\nforms a single connected component and the set of all ocean cells and\nunderwater volcano cells forms a single connected component. Also, it is\nguaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of the grid (that is, at\nthe row 1 , at the row n , at the column 1 , and at the column m ).\n\nThe following q lines describe the queries.

In one operation, you select any\ncontiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this\nsubarray anywhere in the array.\n\nYour task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such\noperations.\n\nAs this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .\n\nReminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y\nsuch that there exists an integer q and x = p \\cdot q + y .\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the\ndescription of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le\n2 \\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,\nrespectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\n(-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does\nnot exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can\nbe obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    12\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    -4 -7\n    \n    3 3\n    \n    2 2 8\n    \n    1 7\n    \n    7\n    \n    5 1\n    \n    4 -2 8 -12 9\n    \n    7 4\n    \n    8 14 -9 6 0 -1 3\n    \n    7 100\n    \n    5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3\n    \n    6 1000\n    \n    -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000\n    \n    2 1\n    \n    1000000000 8\n    \n    5 4\n    \n    0 0 0 0 0\n    \n    6 10\n    \n    48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984\n    \n    7 1\n    \n    -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000\n    \n    10 10050\n    \n    408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045\n\nOutput\n\n    999999996\n    96\n    896\n    17\n    351\n    716455332\n    42\n    2\n    0\n    897909241\n    0\n    416571966\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the\narray twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the\nsum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7\nthis is 999\\,999\\,996 .\n\nIn the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire\narray three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible\nsequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \\rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \\rightarrow [2, 2,\n8, 12, 24 ] \\rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is\n2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .\n\nIn the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array\nconsisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2\nand 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining\nthe array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .\n\nIn the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an\nempty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will\nnot differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the\noriginal array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \\cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =\n-6\\,000\\,000\\,000) .",
