Snuke lives in another world, where slimes are real creatures and kept by some people. Slimes come in N colors. Those colors are conveniently numbered 1 through N. Snuke currently has no slime. His objective is to have slimes of all the colors together.

Snuke can perform the following two actions:

* Select a color i (1≤i≤N), such that he does not currently have a slime in color i, and catch a slime in color i. This action takes him a_i seconds.

* Cast a spell, which changes the color of all the slimes that he currently has. The color of a slime in color i (1≤i≤N-1) will become color i+1, and the color of a slime in color N will become color 1. This action takes him x seconds.




Find the minimum time that Snuke needs to have slimes in all N colors.

Constraints

* 2≤N≤2,000
* a_i are integers.
* 1≤a_i≤10^9
* x is an integer.
* 1≤x≤10^9
