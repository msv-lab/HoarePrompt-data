Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies prime numbers within the given constraints. It iterates through each number in the input list and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if a number is prime. The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the prime-checking algorithm, considering edge cases such as small primes (2 and 3) and even numbers. Additionally, the loop optimization where the inner loop breaks when `i * i > x` ensures efficiency without missing any prime numbers. Since the program handles all provided examples and potential cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
