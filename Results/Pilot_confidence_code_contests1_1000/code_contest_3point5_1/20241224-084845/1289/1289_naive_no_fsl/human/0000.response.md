Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately but does not consider the possibility that the minimum area might be determined by the larger of these two differences. Specifically, the program computes `max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)` which is the side length of the square, but it should compute the square of the maximum of these differences to get the area. 

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
2
0 0
0 3
```

The program incorrectly outputs `4` instead of the correct output `9`. This happens because the program calculates `max(2-0, 3-0) = 3` and then squares it to get `9`, but it should directly output `9` since the side length of the square that covers both points (0,0) and (0,3) is `3`.

To fix this, the program should compute the maximum of `(maxx - minx)` and `(maxy - miny)` and then square the result. The corrected code would look like:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    maxx, maxy = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    minx, miny = float('inf'), float('inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        minx = min(minx, a)
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        miny = min(miny, b)
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum area of the city is calculated correctly.
