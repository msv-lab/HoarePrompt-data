Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple weights can be summed to form a power of two. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the possibility of combining different weights to achieve a power of two sum in a single step.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 2 3 3
```

The correct output should be 2, as the weights can be split into two steps:
1. Throw away the first three weights (2^1, 2^1, 2^2) which sum to 2^3.
2. Throw away the last two weights (2^3, 2^3) which also sum to 2^3.

However, the provided program will incorrectly count this as needing 4 steps, which is not the optimal solution. The program fails to recognize that multiple weights can be combined to form a power of two sum, leading to suboptimal step counts in many cases.
