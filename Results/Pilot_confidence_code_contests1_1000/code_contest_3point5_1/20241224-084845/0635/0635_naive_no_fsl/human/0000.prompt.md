You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, Duff has been practicing weight lifting. As a hard practice, Malek gave her a task. He gave her a sequence of weights. Weight of i-th of them is 2wi pounds. In each step, Duff can lift some of the remaining weights and throw them away. She does this until there's no more weight left. Malek asked her to minimize the number of steps.

<image>

Duff is a competitive programming fan. That's why in each step, she can only lift and throw away a sequence of weights 2a1, ..., 2ak if and only if there exists a non-negative integer x such that 2a1 + 2a2 + ... + 2ak = 2x, i. e. the sum of those numbers is a power of two.

Duff is a competitive programming fan, but not a programmer. That's why she asked for your help. Help her minimize the number of steps. 

Input

The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106), the number of weights.

The second line contains n integers w1, ..., wn separated by spaces (0 ≤ wi ≤ 106 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n), the powers of two forming the weights values.

Output

Print the minimum number of steps in a single line.

Examples

Input

5
1 1 2 3 3


Output

2


Input

4
0 1 2 3


Output

4

Note

In the first sample case: One optimal way would be to throw away the first three in the first step and the rest in the second step. Also, it's not possible to do it in one step because their sum is not a power of two.

In the second sample case: The only optimal way is to throw away one weight in each step. It's not possible to do it in less than 4 steps because there's no subset of weights with more than one weight and sum equal to a power of two.
Program:
```
import sys,math

def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    write = sys.stdout.write
    n = int(input.readline())
    s = input.readline().split()
    A = [int(a) for a in s]
    A.sort()
    A.append(10 ** 12)
    carry = 0
    num = 0
    i = 0
    sum = 0
    while i < n:
        j = i
        while A[i] == A[j + 1]:
            j += 1
        num = j - i + 1 + carry
        k = 0
        while num > 0 and A[j + 1] > k + A[i]:
            sum += num % 2
            num = (num - num % 2) // 2
            k += 1
        if num > 0:
            carry = num
        i = j + 1
    write(str(sum))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
