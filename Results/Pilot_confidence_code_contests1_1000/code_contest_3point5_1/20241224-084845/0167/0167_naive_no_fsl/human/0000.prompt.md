You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There were n types of swords in the theater basement which had been used during the plays. Moreover there were exactly x swords of each type. y people have broken into the theater basement and each of them has taken exactly z swords of some single type. Note that different people might have taken different types of swords. Note that the values x, y and z are unknown for you.

The next morning the director of the theater discovers the loss. He counts all swords — exactly a_i swords of the i-th type are left untouched.

The director has no clue about the initial number of swords of each type in the basement, the number of people who have broken into the basement and how many swords each of them have taken.

For example, if n=3, a = [3, 12, 6] then one of the possible situations is x=12, y=5 and z=3. Then the first three people took swords of the first type and the other two people took swords of the third type. Note that you don't know values x, y and z beforehand but know values of n and a.

Thus he seeks for your help. Determine the minimum number of people y, which could have broken into the theater basement, and the number of swords z each of them has taken.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of types of swords.

The second line of the input contains the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}), where a_i equals to the number of swords of the i-th type, which have remained in the basement after the theft. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one such pair of indices (j, k) that a_j ≠ a_k.

Output

Print two integers y and z — the minimum number of people which could have broken into the basement and the number of swords each of them has taken.

Note

In the first example the minimum value of y equals to 5, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement, is 5. Each of them has taken 3 swords: three of them have taken 3 swords of the first type, and two others have taken 3 swords of the third type.

In the second example the minimum value of y is 1, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken into the basement, equals to 1. He has taken 7 swords of the first type.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
