Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of amazing performances. Specifically, the program only checks if the current performance is better than the previous one, without considering the possibility of breaking the worst performance record. This leads to an incorrect count of amazing performances.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 50 200 150 200
```

The expected output is 2 because the second and third performances are amazing. However, the program will only count the third performance as amazing since it is greater than the second performance, but it will miss the second performance as it does not check for the worst performance condition.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of both the maximum and minimum scores achieved so far and update these values accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    max_score = float('-inf')
    min_score = float('inf')

    for i in range(n):
        if l[i] > max_score:
            c += 1
            max_score = l[i]
        elif l[i] < min_score:
            c += 1
            min_score = l[i]

    print(c)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the best and worst performance conditions are checked for each contest.
