You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel wants to write a task for a programming contest. The task is: "You are given a simple undirected graph with n vertexes. Each its edge has unit length. You should calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2."

Same with some writers, she wants to make an example with some certain output: for example, her birthday or the number of her boyfriend. Can you help her to make a test case with answer equal exactly to k?

Input

The first line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output

You should output a graph G with n vertexes (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). There must be exactly k shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2 of the graph.

The first line must contain an integer n. Then adjacency matrix G with n rows and n columns must follow. Each element of the matrix must be 'N' or 'Y'. If Gij is 'Y', then graph G has a edge connecting vertex i and vertex j. Consider the graph vertexes are numbered from 1 to n.

The graph must be undirected and simple: Gii = 'N' and Gij = Gji must hold. And there must be at least one path between vertex 1 and vertex 2. It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there multiple correct answers, you can output any of them.

Note

In first example, there are 2 shortest paths: 1-3-2 and 1-4-2.

In second example, there are 9 shortest paths: 1-3-6-2, 1-3-7-2, 1-3-8-2, 1-4-6-2, 1-4-7-2, 1-4-8-2, 1-5-6-2, 1-5-7-2, 1-5-8-2.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    k = int(sys.stdin.read().strip())
    if k == 1:
        sys.stdout.write('2\nNY\nYN')
    elif k == 2:
        sys.stdout.write('4\nNNYY\nNNYY\nYYNN\nYYNN')
    elif k == 3:
        sys.stdout.write('5\nNNYYY\nNNYYY\nYYNNN\nYYNNN\nYYNNN')
    else:
        pwr = 0
        while 2 ** (pwr + 1) <= k:
            pwr += 1
        vert = []
        v = -1
        for i in xrange(pwr):
            if i == 0:
                vert += [(1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
                v = 5
            elif i == pwr - 1:
                vert += [(v, v + 1), (v, v + 2), (v + 1, 2), (v + 2, 2)]
                v += 2
            else:
                vert += [(v, v + 1), (v, v + 2), (v + 1, v + 3), (v + 2, v + 3)]
                v += 3
        for i in xrange(pwr - 1):
            if k & 2 ** i:
                if i == 0:
                    vstart = 1
                else:
                    vstart = 2 + 3 * i
                vert += [(vstart, v + 1)]
                v += 1
                for j in xrange(2 * (pwr - i - 1)):
                    vert += [(v, v + 1)]
                    v += 1
                vert += [(v, 2)]
        sys.stdout.write('%d\n' % v)
        vz = [['N'] * v for i in xrange(v)]
        for (a, b) in vert:
            vz[a - 1][b - 1] = vz[b - 1][a - 1] = 'Y'
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join([''.join(i) for i in vz]))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
