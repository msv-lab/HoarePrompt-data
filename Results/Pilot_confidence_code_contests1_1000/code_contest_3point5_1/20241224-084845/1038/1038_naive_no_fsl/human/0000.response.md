Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem description. Specifically, it attempts to sort the array and remove consecutive duplicates, which is not relevant to finding the longest subarray with a sum not divisible by \(x\). 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 3
```

The expected output is `2`, because the subarray `[2, 3]` has a sum of `5`, which is not divisible by `3`. However, the provided program will incorrectly handle this input and other similar cases due to its irrelevant sorting and deduplication logic. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case.
