You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ehab loves number theory, but for some reason he hates the number x. Given an array a, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elements isn't divisible by x, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist.

An array a is a subarray of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5) — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4) — the number of elements in the array a and the number that Ehab hates.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{n} (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) — the elements of the array a.

Output

For each testcase, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by x. If there's no such subarray, print -1.

Example

Input


3
3 3
1 2 3
3 4
1 2 3
2 2
0 6


Output


2
3
-1

Note

In the first test case, the subarray [2,3] has sum of elements 5, which isn't divisible by 3.

In the second test case, the sum of elements of the whole array is 6, which isn't divisible by 4.

In the third test case, all subarrays have an even sum, so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
for i in range(n):
    (n, a) = func_1()
    result = func_2(a, n)
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in result]))

def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()
    return (n, [int(x) for x in line.split(' ')])

def func_2(a, n):
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    result = []
    prev = None
    for x in a:
        if x != prev:
            result.append(x)
        prev = x
    return result


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
