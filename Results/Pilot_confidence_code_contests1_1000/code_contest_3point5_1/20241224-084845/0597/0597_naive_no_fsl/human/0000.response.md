Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the two frequencies are consecutive numbers. In the example provided in the problem description, `a = 2` and `b = 3`, which are consecutive numbers. According to the problem description, Vasya should go to both girlfriends equally often in this case. However, the program incorrectly determines that Vasya will go to Masha more often.

To verify this, let's analyze the case where `a = 2` and `b = 3`:

- The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6.
- If Vasya descends at times from 0 to 2, he goes to Dasha.
- If Vasya descends at times from 2 to 3, he goes to Masha.
- If Vasya descends at times from 3 to 4, he goes to Dasha.
- If Vasya descends at times from 4 to 6, he goes to Masha.

In total, Vasya goes to Dasha for 2 out of 6 intervals and to Masha for 2 out of 6 intervals, making the frequencies equal. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Masha".

Since the program does not handle this specific case correctly, the overall correctness is False.
