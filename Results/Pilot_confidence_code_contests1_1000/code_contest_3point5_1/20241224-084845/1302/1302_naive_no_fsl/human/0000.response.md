Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the undirected edges are oriented in such a way to either maximize or minimize the number of reachable vertices from the starting vertex `s`.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Maximizing Reachable Vertices:**
   - The program attempts to maximize reachability by ensuring that all undirected edges point towards the starting vertex `s` if possible. However, the logic to achieve this is flawed. The program checks if `c == un[j][0]` before setting `b[j] = '+'`, but this condition alone is insufficient. It should also consider the connectivity of other nodes and the structure of the graph to ensure maximal reachability.

2. **Minimizing Reachable Vertices:**
   - Similarly, the logic to minimize reachability is also flawed. The program attempts to orient undirected edges away from `s` if possible, but it does not ensure that this orientation results in the minimal reachable set of vertices. The current implementation might still allow some vertices to be reachable that should not be.

### Example where the Program Fails:

Consider the following graph:

```
Vertices: 4
Edges: 4
Starting Vertex: 1
Edges:
1 2 3
2 4 2
2 1 4
2 3 2
```

- **Maximizing Reachability:**
  - The optimal solution would be to orient the undirected edges `(1,4)` and `(3,2)` such that they increase reachability. One valid solution could be:
    ```
    4
    ++-
    ```
  - However, the program does not guarantee this behavior because it only checks if `c == un[j][0]` without considering the overall graph structure.

- **Minimizing Reachability:**
  - The optimal solution would be to orient the undirected edges `(1,4)` and `(3,2)` such that they decrease reachability. One valid solution could be:
    ```
    2
    +-
    ```
  - However, the program does not guarantee this behavior because it only checks if `c != un[j][0]` without considering the overall graph structure.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the output is incorrect.
