You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a graph containing both directed (oriented) and undirected (non-oriented) edges. There can be multiple edges between a pair of vertices.

Vasya has picked a vertex s from the graph. Now Vasya wants to create two separate plans:

  1. to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to maximize number of vertices reachable from vertex s; 
  2. to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to minimize number of vertices reachable from vertex s. 



In each of two plans each undirected edge must become directed. For an edge chosen directions can differ in two plans.

Help Vasya find the plans.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and s (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 3·105, 1 ≤ s ≤ n) — number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the vertex Vasya has picked.

The following m lines contain information about the graph edges. Each line contains three integers ti, ui and vi (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi) — edge type and vertices connected by the edge. If ti = 1 then the edge is directed and goes from the vertex ui to the vertex vi. If ti = 2 then the edge is undirected and it connects the vertices ui and vi.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one undirected edge in the graph.

Output

The first two lines should describe the plan which maximizes the number of reachable vertices. The lines three and four should describe the plan which minimizes the number of reachable vertices.

A description of each plan should start with a line containing the number of reachable vertices. The second line of a plan should consist of f symbols '+' and '-', where f is the number of undirected edges in the initial graph. Print '+' as the j-th symbol of the string if the j-th undirected edge (u, v) from the input should be oriented from u to v. Print '-' to signify the opposite direction (from v to u). Consider undirected edges to be numbered in the same order they are given in the input.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
