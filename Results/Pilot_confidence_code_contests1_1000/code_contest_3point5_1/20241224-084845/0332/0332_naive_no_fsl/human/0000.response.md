Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the sets of letters for Oleg and Igor contain duplicate characters. Let's consider an example:

**Example:**
- Oleg's set: `aab`
- Igor's set: `bb`

**Expected Output:** The company name should be `abb` because Oleg will replace the first question mark with 'a' and the second question mark with 'b', and Igor will replace the third question mark with 'b'.

However, the current implementation does not account for the optimal placement of these duplicate characters. The program sorts both strings and then tries to place the characters alternately, which can lead to incorrect results in cases with duplicates.

In the given example, the program would produce `aba` instead of `abb`, as it does not ensure that Oleg places the 'b' before the 'a' in the final company name.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
