Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the yearly weight changes for both Limak and Bob until Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's. The program uses a while loop to continue the simulation until the condition `w1 > w2` is met, incrementing the `count` variable each year. This approach ensures that the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob is accurately calculated.

Given the constraints (where `a` and `b` are between 1 and 10), the program will terminate within a small number of iterations, ensuring it handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
