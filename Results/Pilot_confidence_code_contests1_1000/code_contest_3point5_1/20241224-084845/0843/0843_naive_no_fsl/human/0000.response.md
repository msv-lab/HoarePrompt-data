Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost required to determine all of \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N\). The logic in the program focuses on union-find operations but does not properly account for the parity constraints given by the equations \(A_{X_i} + A_{Y_i} + Z_i\) being even.

To illustrate, consider the following case:
- \(N = 4\)
- \(M = 2\)
- \(X_1 = 1, Y_1 = 2, Z_1 = 1\)
- \(X_2 = 2, Y_2 = 3, Z_2 = 1\)

In this case, we have the following parity constraints:
- \(A_1 + A_2 + 1\) is even
- \(A_2 + A_3 + 1\) is even

From these constraints, we can deduce that \(A_1\) and \(A_3\) must have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, the union-find approach in the provided program does not capture this dependency directly.

The correct solution should involve analyzing the parity constraints and determining the minimum number of queries needed to resolve the parities. The provided program only counts the number of unique connected components, which does not necessarily reflect the minimum cost required to determine all \(A_i\).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this and potentially other cases, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
