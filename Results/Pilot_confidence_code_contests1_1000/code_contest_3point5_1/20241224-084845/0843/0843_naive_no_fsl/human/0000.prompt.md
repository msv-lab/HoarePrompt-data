You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N cards placed face down in a row. On each card, an integer 1 or 2 is written.

Let A_i be the integer written on the i-th card.

Your objective is to guess A_1, A_2, ..., A_N correctly.

You know the following facts:

* For each i = 1, 2, ..., M, the value A_{X_i} + A_{Y_i} + Z_i is an even number.



You are a magician and can use the following magic any number of times:

Magic: Choose one card and know the integer A_i written on it. The cost of using this magic is 1.

What is the minimum cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N?

It is guaranteed that there is no contradiction in given input.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq X_i < Y_i \leq N
* 1 \leq Z_i \leq 100
* The pairs (X_i, Y_i) are distinct.
* There is no contradiction in input. (That is, there exist integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N that satisfy the conditions.)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
X_1 Y_1 Z_1
X_2 Y_2 Z_2
\vdots
X_M Y_M Z_M


Output

Print the minimum total cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
