Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program uses a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to count the number of souvenir types that can be purchased if one takes a train with a given interval `d`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of souvenir types that can be purchased for each `d`.

The issue lies in the line `ans = n - total`. This line subtracts the total number of souvenir types that can be purchased from `n`, which is the total number of souvenir types. This subtraction does not accurately reflect the number of unique souvenir types that can be purchased for a given `d`.

To fix this, we need to maintain a separate set to track the unique souvenir types that can be purchased for each `d`. Additionally, the program should correctly calculate the number of unique souvenir types that can be purchased by iterating through the stations and checking the souvenirs available at those stations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    souvenirs_at_stations = [[] for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split())
        souvenirs_at_stations[r - l].append(i)

    souvenir_types = [set() for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for d in range(1, m + 1):
        for i in souvenirs_at_stations[d]:
            for j in range(d, m + 1, d):
                souvenir_types[j].add(i)

    for d in range(1, m + 1):
        print(len(souvenir_types[d]))


func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set for each `d` to keep track of the unique souvenir types that can be purchased and prints the correct number of unique souvenir types for each `d`.
