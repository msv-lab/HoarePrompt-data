Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when a bird is shot from the first wire. Specifically, when a bird is shot from the first wire, the birds to the right of the shot bird should jump down to the second wire, but the program incorrectly sets `ar[a-1]` to 0 instead of updating the count of birds on the second wire.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
2 4 1
1
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0
3
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
0
3
```

This happens because the program sets `ar[0]` to 0 when the bird is shot from the first wire, instead of adding the remaining birds to the second wire. Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the behavior described in the problem statement.
