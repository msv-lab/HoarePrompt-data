You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Shaass has decided to hunt some birds. There are n horizontal electricity wires aligned parallel to each other. Wires are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom. On each wire there are some oskols sitting next to each other. Oskol is the name of a delicious kind of birds in Shaass's territory. Supposed there are ai oskols sitting on the i-th wire.

<image>

Sometimes Shaass shots one of the birds and the bird dies (suppose that this bird sat at the i-th wire). Consequently all the birds on the i-th wire to the left of the dead bird get scared and jump up on the wire number i - 1, if there exists no upper wire they fly away. Also all the birds to the right of the dead bird jump down on wire number i + 1, if there exists no such wire they fly away. 

Shaass has shot m birds. You're given the initial number of birds on each wire, tell him how many birds are sitting on each wire after the shots.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next line contains a list of space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an, (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100). 

The third line contains an integer m, (0 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains two integers xi and yi. The integers mean that for the i-th time Shaass shoot the yi-th (from left) bird on the xi-th wire, (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ yi). It's guaranteed there will be at least yi birds on the xi-th wire at that moment.

Output

On the i-th line of the output print the number of birds on the i-th wire.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
