Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` array is incorrect for determining the winner.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
```

This line checks if there exists any `ai` such that removing `ai` stones from the current pile size `i` would leave the opponent in a losing position (`not dp[i - ai]`). However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner correctly. The correct approach should ensure that the current player can always force the opponent into a losing position, which requires a more complex logic to track the optimal moves.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 6
2 3
```

- If `K = 6`, the program incorrectly outputs `First`, but the correct output should be `Second`. This is because Taro (the first player) cannot force Jiro into a losing position with the given set `{2, 3}`. No matter which move Taro makes, Jiro can always respond in a way that eventually forces Taro to lose.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using the concept of the Nim-sum or directly simulating the game states to determine the winner. The current implementation does not cover all edge cases and fails to correctly determine the winner in some scenarios.
