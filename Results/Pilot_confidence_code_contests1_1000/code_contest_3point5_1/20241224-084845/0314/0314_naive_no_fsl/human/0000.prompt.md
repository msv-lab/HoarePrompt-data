You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Being stuck at home, Ray became extremely bored. To pass time, he asks Lord Omkar to use his time bending power: Infinity Clock! However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:

You are given an array a of n integers. You are also given an integer k. Lord Omkar wants you to do k operations with this array.

Define one operation as the following: 

  1. Set d to be the maximum value of your array. 
  2. For every i from 1 to n, replace a_{i} with d-a_{i}. 



The goal is to predict the contents in the array after k operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}) – the length of your array and the number of operations to perform.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (-10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) – the initial contents of your array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each case, print the final version of array a after k operations described above.

Example

Input


3
2 1
-199 192
5 19
5 -1 4 2 0
1 2
69


Output


391 0
0 6 1 3 5
0

Note

In the first test case the array changes as follows:

  * Initially, the array is [-199, 192]. d = 192.

  * After the operation, the array becomes [d-(-199), d-192] = [391, 0].

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
