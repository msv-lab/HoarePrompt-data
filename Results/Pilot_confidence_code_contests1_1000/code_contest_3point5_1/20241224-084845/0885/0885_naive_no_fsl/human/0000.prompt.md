You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafes n times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.

First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.

Input

In first line there is one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.

In second line, n numbers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.

Output

Print one integer — index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.

Examples

Input

5
1 3 2 1 2


Output

3


Input

6
2 1 2 2 4 1


Output

2

Note

In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices 1 and 2 were after the last visit to cafe with index 3; so this cafe is the answer. 

In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices 1, 2 and 4. Cafes with indices 1 and 4 were visited after the last visit of cafe with index 2, so the answer is 2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = raw_input()
    a = raw_input()
    a = a.split()
    n = int(n)
    for i in range(n):
        mm = False
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] == a[j] and i != j:
                mm = True
            elif mm == False and i + j == n - 1:
                print(a[i])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
