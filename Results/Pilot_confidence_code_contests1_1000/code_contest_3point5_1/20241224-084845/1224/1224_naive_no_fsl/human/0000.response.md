Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` and its recursive helper function `func_1` do not correctly generate the largest possible number for some inputs. 

For example, consider the input:
```
20 4
3 7 8 4
```

The expected output is `777773`, but the program may not generate this correctly due to the way the recursion and sorting are handled. The function `func_1` tries to break down the target number into valid digits, but the logic for combining these digits to form the largest possible number is flawed. The program might not explore all valid combinations efficiently, leading to suboptimal results.

To verify this, let's manually check the process:
- For `N = 20` and digits `[3, 7, 8, 4]`, the largest possible number is `777773`.
- However, the program might not correctly handle the combination of digits to achieve this.

Since the program does not guarantee the generation of the largest possible number for all inputs, it is incorrect.
