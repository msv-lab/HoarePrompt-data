Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of duels. The program generates a pattern that does not ensure the maximum number of duels for all board sizes. For example, when `n = 4`, the output would be:

```
WBWB
BBBW
WBWB
BBBW
```

This pattern does not maximize the number of duels. To maximize the number of duels, a more complex pattern is needed, such as alternating rows between WB and BW for even `n` and a slightly modified pattern for odd `n`. For instance, for `n = 3`, the correct output should be:

```
WBW
BBB
WBW
```

The provided program fails to generate this correct pattern for odd `n`, thus it is not correct according to the problem description.
