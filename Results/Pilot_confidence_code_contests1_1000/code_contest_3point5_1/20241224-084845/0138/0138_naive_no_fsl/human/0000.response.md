Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to find the lexicographically minimum string that is strictly greater than `t` when such a string does not exist. Let's consider an example:

### Example Case
**Input:**
```
czaaab
abcdef
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abczaa
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

### Issue Analysis
The program checks if all characters in `s` are greater than or equal to the corresponding characters in `t`. If this condition holds, it tries to generate a string by appending characters from `s` to `t` to make it lexicographically greater. However, it does not ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible one that is strictly greater than `t`.

To fix this, the program needs to perform a more detailed check to find the smallest valid permutation. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input().strip())
    t = list(input().strip())
    
    # Count occurrences of each character in s and t
    scount = [0] * 26
    tcount = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
    # Check if s is already lexicographically greater than or equal to t
    allgreater = True
    for i in range(26):
        if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
            allgreater = False
            break
    
    if allgreater:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            return -1
        for char in t:
            scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        for i in range(26):
            while scount[i] > 0:
                t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
                scount[i] -= 1
        return ''.join(t)
    
    # Find the position to swap to make s lexicographically greater than t
    works = -1
    scountcopy = list(scount)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cando = False
        for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
            if scountcopy[j] > 0:
                cando = True
        if cando:
            works = i
        if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
            break
        scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    
    if works == -1:
        return -1
    
    # Construct the result string
    res = list(t[:works])
    for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
        if scount[j] > 0:
            res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
            scount[j] -= 1
            break
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(res)

print(func_1())
```

This corrected version ensures that the program finds the lexicographically minimum string that is strictly greater than `t` when such a string exists.
