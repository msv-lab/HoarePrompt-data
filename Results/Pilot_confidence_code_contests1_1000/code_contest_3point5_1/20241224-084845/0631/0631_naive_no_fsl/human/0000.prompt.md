You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n rectangles. The corners of rectangles have integer coordinates and their edges are parallel to the Ox and Oy axes. The rectangles may touch each other, but they do not overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle). 

Your task is to determine if the rectangles form a square. In other words, determine if the set of points inside or on the border of at least one rectangle is precisely equal to the set of points inside or on the border of some square.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5). Next n lines contain four integers each, describing a single rectangle: x1, y1, x2, y2 (0 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 31400, 0 ≤ y1 < y2 ≤ 31400) — x1 and x2 are x-coordinates of the left and right edges of the rectangle, and y1 and y2 are y-coordinates of the bottom and top edges of the rectangle. 

No two rectangles overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle).

Output

In a single line print "YES", if the given rectangles form a square, or "NO" otherwise.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    area = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if i == 0:
            minx = x1
            miny = y1
            maxx = x2
            maxy = y2
        else:
            minx = min(minx, x1)
            miny = min(miny, y1)
            maxx = max(maxx, x2)
            maxy = max(maxy, y2)
        area += (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)
    dx = maxx - minx
    dy = maxy - miny
    if dx != dy or dx * dy != area:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
