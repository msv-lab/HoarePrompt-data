Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it checks if the rectangles form a square. Specifically, the program calculates the total area covered by the rectangles and compares it with the area of a potential square defined by the minimum and maximum coordinates. However, it fails to ensure that the dimensions of this potential square (maxx - minx and maxy - miny) are equal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0 0 2 3
0 3 3 5
2 0 5 2
3 2 5 5
```

The program will output "YES" because it correctly calculates the total area and checks the dimensions, but the rectangles do not form a square. The given rectangles cover a rectangular area, not a square.

To correctly determine if the rectangles form a square, the program should check if the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates after ensuring the total area is correct. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    areas = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        areas.append((x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1))
    
    total_area = sum(areas)
    minx = min(x1 for x1, _, _, _ in areas)
    maxx = max(x2 for _, y1, x2, _ in areas)
    miny = min(y1 for _, y1, _, _ in areas)
    maxy = max(y2 for _, _, _, y2 in areas)
    
    side_length = maxx - minx
    if side_length != maxy - miny or total_area != side_length ** 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the dimensions of the potential square are checked properly and that the total area matches the area of the square.
