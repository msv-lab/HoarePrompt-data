Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the string contains an equal number of '?' characters in positions that cannot be resolved to make the substring unstable. For example, consider the string `???`. According to the problem description, this string should be considered beautiful because we can replace the '?' characters to form an unstable substring. However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

In the given implementation, the program attempts to count the number of valid substrings by tracking the counts of '0', '1', and '?' characters in even and odd positions. However, it fails to handle the case where the string consists entirely of '?' characters, which can form an unstable substring by replacing them appropriately.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly handle the case where the entire substring can be made unstable by replacing '?' characters with either '0' or '1'. This can be done by counting the number of '?' characters and ensuring they can be replaced to form an alternating pattern.
