Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the total length of the ray's trajectory by iteratively reducing the lengths `a` and `b` until they become equal, which ensures that the ray eventually returns to the rifle. The program handles the reflections and additions to the total length `res` appropriately. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program seems to cover all necessary cases without any apparent issues. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were provided that would cause the program to fail, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description.
