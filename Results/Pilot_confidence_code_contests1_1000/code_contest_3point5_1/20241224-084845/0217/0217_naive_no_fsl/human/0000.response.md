Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for sorting the permutation using the allowed operations. Specifically, the logic for determining which indices to swap is flawed. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
6
2 5 3 1 4 6
```

The correct output should be:
```
3
1 5
2 5
1 4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
1 5
2 5
1 3
```

This is incorrect because after the first two swaps, the array becomes `[4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6]`. The third swap with `1` and `3` results in `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 6]`, which is not sorted. The correct third swap should be between `1` and `4`.

The issue lies in the logic where the program attempts to find indices to swap that satisfy the condition `2 * |i - j| >= n`. The current implementation does not always find the correct indices to ensure the array gets sorted correctly. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
