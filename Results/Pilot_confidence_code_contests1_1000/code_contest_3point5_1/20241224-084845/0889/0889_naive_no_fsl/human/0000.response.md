Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where multiple instances of the same integer are present in the list, which could potentially lead to a situation where breaking fewer bricks could still satisfy Snuke's desire.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. This is because the program only checks if the first occurrence of each integer matches its position and does not account for multiple occurrences of the same integer. In this case, since there are three '2's and no '1', the program incorrectly suggests breaking one brick to make the second '2' match its position, when in fact, Snuke's desire is unsatisfiable.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all occurrences of each integer match their positions after breaking the minimum number of bricks.
