Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where completing a full task (solving all k subtasks) yields more points than just solving individual subtasks up to a certain point.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 4 18
4 2 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to complete one full task (since it gives 5 points instead of 4 points from solving only 4 subtasks). However, the current implementation might not consider this optimal strategy because it sorts the times and then tries to build rows of subtasks incrementally. 

In this example, the sorted times are `[1, 1, 2, 4]`. The program might incorrectly choose to solve subtasks row by row without considering the benefit of completing a full task.

To verify this, let's manually check the optimal solution:
- Solving one full task (1+2+1+4 = 8 minutes, 5 points)
- Solving another full task (another 8 minutes, another 5 points)
- Remaining time: 2 minutes, which can be used to solve one more subtask (1 minute), giving 1 more point.

Total points: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 points.

However, the program might not reach this conclusion due to its current logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
