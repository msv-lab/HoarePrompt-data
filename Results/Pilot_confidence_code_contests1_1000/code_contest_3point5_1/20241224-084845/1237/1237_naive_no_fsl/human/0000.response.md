Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `get(key, value)` assumes that the value of `key` is less than `k`, but this is not always true. According to the problem, `key` is the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `k`, which means `0 <= key < k`. However, the current implementation of `get(key, value)` does not account for the fact that `key` could be zero. When `key` is zero, the formula `k - key + (value - 1) * k` will not yield the correct result because it will always return `value * k`.

To fix this, the function `get(key, value)` should handle the case where `key` is zero separately. Here is the corrected version of the `get` function:

```python
def get(key, value):
    if key == 0:
        return 0
    return k - key + (value - 1) * k
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases described in the problem.
