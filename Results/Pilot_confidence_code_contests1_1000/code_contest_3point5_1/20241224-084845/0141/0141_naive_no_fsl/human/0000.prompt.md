You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day n friends gathered together to play "Mafia". During each round of the game some player must be the supervisor and other n - 1 people take part in the game. For each person we know in how many rounds he wants to be a player, not the supervisor: the i-th person wants to play ai rounds. What is the minimum number of rounds of the "Mafia" game they need to play to let each person play at least as many rounds as they want?

Input

The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the i-th number in the list is the number of rounds the i-th person wants to play.

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of game rounds the friends need to let the i-th person play at least ai rounds.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Note

You don't need to know the rules of "Mafia" to solve this problem. If you're curious, it's a game Russia got from the Soviet times: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game).
Program:
```
import math

try:
    import psyco
    psyco.full()
except:
    pass
func_1()

def func_1():
    from sys import stdin, stdout
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    array = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    sum = 0.0
    max = array[0]
    for a in array:
        sum += a
        if a > max:
            max = a
    p = math.ceil(sum / (n - 1))
    while p * (n - 1) < sum:
        p += 1
    if p < max:
        p = max
    stdout.write(str(int(p)) + '\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
