You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting.

Suppose the graph G is given. Subset A of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge uv there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. <image> or <image> (or both).

Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.

They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself).

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the prize graph, respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n), denoting an undirected edge between ui and vi. It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.

Output

If it's impossible to split the graph between Pari and Arya as they expect, print "-1" (without quotes).

If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer k denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains k integers — the indices of vertices. Note that because of m ≥ 1, vertex cover cannot be empty.

Examples

Input

4 2
1 2
2 3


Output

1
2 
2
1 3 


Input

3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample, you can give the vertex number 2 to Arya and vertices numbered 1 and 3 to Pari and keep vertex number 4 for yourself (or give it someone, if you wish).

In the second sample, there is no way to satisfy both Pari and Arya.
Program:
```
import sys

e = ''
if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    cl = [0] * (n + 1)
    hasE = [False] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(1, m + 1):
        (u, v) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        e += str(u) + ' ' + str(v) + '\n'
        e += str(v) + ' ' + str(u) + '\n'
        hasE[u] = hasE[v] = True
    for i in xrange(1, n + 1):
        if cl[i] == 0 and hasE[i]:
            cl[i] = 1
            func_1(i)
    stra = ''

    nA = 0
    nB = 0
    for i in xrange(1, n + 1):
        if cl[i] == 1:
            nA += 1
            stra += str(i) + ' '
        elif cl[i] == 2:
            nB += 1
            strb += str(i) + ' '
    print(nA)
    print(stra)
    print(nB)
    print(strb)

def func_1(u):
    for v in xrange(1, n + 1):
        try:
            x = str(u) + ' ' + str(v)
            y = str(v) + ' ' + str(u)
            if (e.index(x) or e.index(y)) and u != v:
                if cl[v] == 0:
                    cl[v] = 3 - cl[u]
                    func_1(v)
                elif cl[v] != 3 - cl[u]:
                    print('-1')
                    sys.exit(0)
        except ValueError:
            pass

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
