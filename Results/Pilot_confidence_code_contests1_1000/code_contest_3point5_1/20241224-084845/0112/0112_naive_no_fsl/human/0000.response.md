Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program fails to handle graphs where the solution requires more complex vertex cover configurations. 

Consider the following graph:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```

This graph is a triangle, and it's impossible to split it into two disjoint vertex covers as per the problem statement. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. Instead of outputting `-1`, the program may incorrectly attempt to assign vertices to either `A` or `B`, leading to an invalid configuration.

To fix this, the program needs to recognize that if a vertex cover exists at all, it must be able to split the graph into two disjoint vertex covers. The current implementation does not check for the feasibility of splitting the graph and can lead to incorrect outputs.
