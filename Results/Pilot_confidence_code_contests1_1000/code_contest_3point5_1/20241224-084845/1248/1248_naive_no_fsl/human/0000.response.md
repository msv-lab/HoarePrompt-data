Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in calculating the weights of the pieces. Specifically, the variable `p1` is being incorrectly updated. The nested loops are unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, a simpler approach is needed to iterate through the board and calculate the weights directly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(data):
    p1 = 0
    p2 = 0
    for row in data:
        for char in row:
            if char.isupper():
                if char == 'Q':
                    p1 += 9
                elif char == 'R':
                    p1 += 5
                elif char == 'B':
                    p1 += 3
                elif char == 'N':
                    p1 += 3
                elif char == 'P':
                    p1 += 1
            elif char.islower():
                if char == 'q':
                    p2 += 9
                elif char == 'r':
                    p2 += 5
                elif char == 'b':
                    p2 += 3
                elif char == 'n':
                    p2 += 3
                elif char == 'p':
                    p2 += 1
    
    if p1 > p2:
        return "White"
    elif p1 < p2:
        return "Black"
    else:
        return "Draw"
```

This corrected function iterates through each character in the board, checks if it is uppercase or lowercase to determine the player, and adds the corresponding weight to the respective player's total. This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the weights for both players.
