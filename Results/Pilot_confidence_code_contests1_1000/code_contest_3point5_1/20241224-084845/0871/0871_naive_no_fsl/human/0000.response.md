Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd and `k` requires specific pairs to achieve the exact score. Specifically, the program logic assumes that `n // 2` is sufficient to cover the required `k` points, but it fails to handle scenarios where an odd `n` might require a different approach.

For example, consider the input `7 2`. According to the problem description, we need to find 7 distinct integers such that the GCD operations result in exactly 2 points. However, the current implementation cannot generate such a sequence because it only handles even `n` or specific edge cases. This results in the program outputting `-1`, which is incorrect as per the problem statement.

A correct approach would involve generating pairs that contribute to the exact `k` points, even when `n` is odd.
