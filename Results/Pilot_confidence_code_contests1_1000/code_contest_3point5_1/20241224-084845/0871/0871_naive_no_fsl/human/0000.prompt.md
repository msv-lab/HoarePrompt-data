You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's holiday. Mashmokh and his boss, Bimokh, are playing a game invented by Mashmokh. 

In this game Mashmokh writes sequence of n distinct integers on the board. Then Bimokh makes several (possibly zero) moves. On the first move he removes the first and the second integer from from the board, on the second move he removes the first and the second integer of the remaining sequence from the board, and so on. Bimokh stops when the board contains less than two numbers. When Bimokh removes numbers x and y from the board, he gets gcd(x, y) points. At the beginning of the game Bimokh has zero points.

Mashmokh wants to win in the game. For this reason he wants his boss to get exactly k points in total. But the guy doesn't know how choose the initial sequence in the right way. 

Please, help him. Find n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an such that his boss will score exactly k points. Also Mashmokh can't memorize too huge numbers. Therefore each of these integers must be at most 109.

Input

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ k ≤ 108).

Output

If such sequence doesn't exist output -1 otherwise output n distinct space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Examples

Input

5 2


Output

1 2 3 4 5


Input

5 3

Output

2 4 3 7 1

Input

7 2


Output

-1

Note

gcd(x, y) is greatest common divisor of x and y.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if n == 1 and k == 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 1 or k == 0:
        print(-1)
    elif n // 2 > k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = []
        nums = n // 2
        needed = [k + 1 - nums, (k + 1 - nums) * 2]
        curr = 1
        for i in range(nums - 1):
            while curr in needed or curr + 1 in needed:
                curr += 1
            ans.append(curr)
            ans.append(curr + 1)
            curr += 2
        ans.append(needed[0])
        ans.append(needed[1])
        if len(ans) == n:
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
        else:
            ans.append(max(ans) + 1)
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
