Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to have a few issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Function `func_1` and `func_2` Naming and Usage**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used consistently. In the main part of the code, the function `func_1` is called within itself recursively without proper initialization of `visited` arrays and distance matrices. This can lead to incorrect distance calculations.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to calculate distances but does not properly initialize the distance matrix `d`. The `d` matrix is supposed to store the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes, but the current implementation might not correctly initialize or update these values.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where removing a single vertex might make the tree good. It only considers removing multiple vertices, which might not be necessary.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a specific test case:

### Test Case:
```
6 2
1 2
3 2
4 2
1 6
5 6
```

**Expected Output**: The output should be `2`, as removing vertices 2 and 4 would result in a tree with a diameter of 2.

However, the provided code might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically, the distance calculation and the way vertices are marked as visited could lead to incorrect results.

### Suggested Fixes:
1. Ensure proper initialization of the distance matrix `d`.
2. Use BFS correctly to calculate distances.
3. Handle edge cases where removing a single vertex might make the tree good.

Given these issues, the provided code is likely incorrect for some cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
