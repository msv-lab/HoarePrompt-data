Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has an issue with handling the input types. Specifically, the `raw_input()` function is used, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. If the program is run in Python 3 without this change, it will raise a `NameError` because `raw_input()` is not defined.

To fix this, the program should be updated to use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(0, a + 1):
        for j in range(0, b + 1):
            t = (n - 0.5 * i - j) / 2
            if t >= 0 and t <= c and (t == int(t)):
                ans += 1
    print(ans)

func()
```

This correction ensures that the program runs correctly in both Python 2 and Python 3, and it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
