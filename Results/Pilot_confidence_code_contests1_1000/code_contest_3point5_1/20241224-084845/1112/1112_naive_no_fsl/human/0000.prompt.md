You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For an array a of integers let's denote its maximal element as max(a), and minimal as min(a). We will call an array a of k integers interesting if max(a) - min(a) ≥ k. For example, array [1, 3, 4, 3] isn't interesting as max(a) - min(a) = 4 - 1 = 3 < 4 while array [7, 3, 0, 4, 3] is as max(a) - min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7 ≥ 5.

You are given an array a of n integers. Find some interesting nonempty subarray of a, or tell that it doesn't exist.

An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤ n ≤ 2⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output "NO" in a separate line if there is no interesting nonempty subarray in a. 

Otherwise, output "YES" in a separate line. In the next line, output two integers l and r (1≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — bounds of the chosen subarray. If there are multiple answers, print any.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


3
5
1 2 3 4 5
4
2 0 1 9
2
2019 2020


Output


NO
YES
1 4
NO

Note

In the second test case of the example, one of the interesting subarrays is a = [2, 0, 1, 9]: max(a) - min(a) = 9 - 0 = 9 ≥ 4.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    t = input()
    inp = stdin.readlines()
    out = []
    for itr in xrange(t):
        n = int(inp[itr << 1].strip())
        a = map(int, inp[itr << 1 | 1].strip().split())
        flag = 0
        for i in xrange(n - 1):
            if abs(a[i] - a[i + 1]) >= 2:
                out.append('YES')
                out.append(' '.join([str(i + 1), str(i + 2)]))
                flag = 1
                break
        if flag == 0:
            out.append('NO')
    stdout.write('\n'.join(out))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
