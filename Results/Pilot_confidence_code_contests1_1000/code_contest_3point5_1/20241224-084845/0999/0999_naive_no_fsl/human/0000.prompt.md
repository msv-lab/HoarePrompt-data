You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function f(x) (x is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of x backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, f(321) = 123, f(120) = 21, f(1000000) = 1, f(111) = 111.

Let's define another function g(x) = (x)/(f(f(x))) (x is a positive integer as well).

Your task is the following: for the given positive integer n, calculate the number of different values of g(x) among all numbers x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1 ≤ n < 10^{100}). This integer is given without leading zeroes.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of different values of the function g(x), if x can be any integer from [1, n].

Example

Input


5
4
37
998244353
1000000007
12345678901337426966631415


Output


1
2
9
10
26

Note

Explanations for the two first test cases of the example:

  1. if n = 4, then for every integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, (x)/(f(f(x))) = 1; 
  2. if n = 37, then for some integers x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, (x)/(f(f(x))) = 1 (for example, if x = 23, f(f(x)) = 23,(x)/(f(f(x))) = 1); and for other values of x, (x)/(f(f(x))) = 10 (for example, if x = 30, f(f(x)) = 3, (x)/(f(f(x))) = 10). So, there are two different values of g(x).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
