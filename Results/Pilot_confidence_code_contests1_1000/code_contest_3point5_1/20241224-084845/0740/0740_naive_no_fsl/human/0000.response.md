Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where Alice can move her token after answering the last question. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5 3
  5 1 4
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  9
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program might output a different number or might not handle this case correctly.

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes `counter` with `(-1, -1)` for each cell.
   - It then iterates over Bob's questions to update the `counter` array.

2. **Counting Valid Scenarios:**
   - The program counts valid scenarios based on the positions and movements described in the problem.
   - However, it does not fully account for the possibility of Alice moving her token after answering the last question.

### Missing Logic:
- The program does not properly handle the scenario where Alice can move her token after answering the last question. This means that the program might miss valid scenarios where Alice can stay in a cell until the end and then move to another cell.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5 3
  5 1 4
  ```

- **Expected Valid Scenarios:**
  - (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)

- **Issue in the Program:**
  - The program might not correctly count (4, 5) because it does not fully account for the movement after the last question.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the full range of possible movements, particularly the movement after the last question. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
