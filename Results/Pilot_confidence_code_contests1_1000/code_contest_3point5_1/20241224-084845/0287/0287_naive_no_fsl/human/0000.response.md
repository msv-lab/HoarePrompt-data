Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest digit from the first list and the smallest digit from the second list are the same. In such a case, the program should print a single digit instead of concatenating two digits. However, the current implementation will concatenate the two smallest digits, which is not the smallest pretty integer.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 1
9
8
```

The smallest pretty integer should be `8`, but the program will output `98`. This shows that the program does not handle this specific case correctly.
