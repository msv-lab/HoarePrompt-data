Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible least common multiple (LCM) of three integers not greater than `n`. Specifically, the program's logic is flawed because it relies on a function `func_1` that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) but uses it incorrectly to filter numbers for calculating the LCM.

The program aims to find three numbers whose LCM is maximized. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the chosen numbers will indeed maximize the LCM. The approach of selecting three numbers and checking their GCD is not sufficient to guarantee the maximum LCM.

A correct solution would involve iterating through possible combinations of three numbers and calculating their LCM to find the maximum. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Iterate through all possible triplets `(a, b, c)` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are between 1 and `n`.
2. Calculate the LCM of each triplet.
3. Keep track of the maximum LCM found.

This approach ensures that all potential combinations are considered, leading to the correct maximum LCM.
