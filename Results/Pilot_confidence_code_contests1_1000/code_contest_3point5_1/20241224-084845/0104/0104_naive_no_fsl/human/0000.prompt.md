You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Some days ago, I learned the concept of LCM (least common multiple). I've played with it for several times and I want to make a big number with it.

But I also don't want to use many numbers, so I'll choose three positive integers (they don't have to be distinct) which are not greater than n. Can you help me to find the maximum possible least common multiple of these three integers?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the n mentioned in the statement.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater than n.

Examples

Input

9


Output

504


Input

7


Output

210

Note

The least common multiple of some positive integers is the least positive integer which is multiple for each of them.

The result may become very large, 32-bit integer won't be enough. So using 64-bit integers is recommended.

For the last example, we can chose numbers 7, 6, 5 and the LCM of them is 7·6·5 = 210. It is the maximum value we can get.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
if n == 1:
    print(1)
elif n == 2:
    print(2)
else:
    ans = n
    sec = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, 1, -1):
        if count == 0:
            if func_1(n, i) == 1:
                ans *= i
                sec = i
                count += 1
        elif count == 1:
            if func_1(n, i) == 1 and func_1(sec, i) == 1:
                ans *= i
                count += 1
        elif count == 2:
            break
    print(ans)

def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return func_1(b, a % b)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
