Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of holes that Arkady should block to ensure at least `B` liters of water flow out of the first hole. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of holes `n`, the volume of water `A`, and the desired volume `B` from standard input. It also reads the sizes of the holes `s`.

2. **Calculation of Required Water Flow**: The program calculates the required amount of water (`ext`) that needs to flow out of the first hole to meet the requirement `B`. This is done using the formula `(A * s[0]) / B`.

3. **Sorting and Iteration**: The program sorts the hole sizes in descending order and iteratively checks each hole, subtracting its size from the total sum of hole sizes (`su`). When the sum of remaining hole sizes is less than or equal to the required water flow, it breaks out of the loop, indicating the minimum number of holes to block.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of holes that need to be blocked (`ans`).

Given the logic and the implementation, the program handles all the provided examples correctly and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
