You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for n flowers and so it looks like a pipe with n holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.

Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour A liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s_1, s_2, …, s_n. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is S, and the i-th hole is not blocked, (s_i ⋅ A)/(S) liters of water will flow out of it.

What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least B liters of water flow out of the first hole?

Input

The first line contains three integers n, A, B (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ B ≤ A ≤ 10^4) — the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.

The second line contains n integers s_1, s_2, …, s_n (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^4) — the sizes of the holes.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of holes Arkady should block.

Examples

Input

4 10 3
2 2 2 2


Output

1


Input

4 80 20
3 2 1 4


Output

0


Input

5 10 10
1000 1 1 1 1


Output

4

Note

In the first example Arkady should block at least one hole. After that, (10 ⋅ 2)/(6) ≈ 3.333 liters of water will flow out of the first hole, and that suits Arkady.

In the second example even without blocking any hole, (80 ⋅ 3)/(10) = 24 liters will flow out of the first hole, that is not less than 20.

In the third example Arkady has to block all holes except the first to make all water flow out of the first hole.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import *

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    (ceil1, out) = (lambda a, b: (a + b - 1) // b, [])
    (n, a, b) = rints()
    s = rints()
    (ext, ans, su) = (a * s[0] // b, 0, sum(s))
    for i in sorted(s[1:])[::-1]:
        if su <= ext:
            break
        su -= i
        ans += 1
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
