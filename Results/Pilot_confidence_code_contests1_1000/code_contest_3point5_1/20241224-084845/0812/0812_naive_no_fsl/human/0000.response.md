Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of benches `n`, the number of additional people `m`, and the current number of people on each bench `a_i`.

2. **Sorting Bench Capacities**: The program sorts the list `asort` in descending order, which helps in determining the distribution of new people to minimize and maximize the maximum number of people on a single bench.

3. **Calculating Minimum K (`mink`)**:
   - It calculates the number of empty spaces that can be filled without increasing the maximum number of people on a single bench.
   - If the additional people `m` can fit into these empty spaces, `mink` is set to the maximum number of people already on the most crowded bench.
   - Otherwise, it accounts for the overflow by adding the ceiling of the remaining people divided by the number of benches.

4. **Calculating Maximum K (`maxk`)**:
   - The maximum `k` is simply the current maximum number of people on any bench plus the total number of additional people `m`.

Given these points, the program handles all edge cases and examples provided. The logic ensures that both the minimum and maximum possible values of `k` are correctly calculated based on the input conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
