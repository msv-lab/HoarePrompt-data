You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that a_i people are currently sitting on the i-th bench. Another m people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of n available.

Let k be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k.

Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of benches in the park.

The second line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000) — the number of people additionally coming to the park.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the initial number of people on the i-th bench.

Output

Print the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k, where k is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park.

Note

In the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum k is 3. For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum k is 7. That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.

The second example has its minimum k equal to 15 and maximum k equal to 15, as there is just a single bench in the park and all 10 people will occupy it.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    asort = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    numspacesremaining = asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])
    if m <= numspacesremaining:
        mink = max(asort)
    else:
        mink = max(asort) + max(math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)), 0)
    maxk = max(a) + m
    print(str(int(mink)) + ' ' + str(maxk))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
