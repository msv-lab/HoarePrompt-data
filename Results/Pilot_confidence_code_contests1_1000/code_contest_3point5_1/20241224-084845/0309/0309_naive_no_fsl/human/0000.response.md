Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases. Here are some key problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Lucky Numbers**: The function `func_3` is designed to generate the next lucky number by replacing the rightmost occurrence of '4' with '7' and then appending '4' to the remaining part. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated number will always be the next lexicographically smallest lucky number. For example, the next lucky number after 4447 should be 4474, but the current implementation might incorrectly generate 4477.

2. **Incorrect Permutation Generation Logic**: The main logic for generating the k-th permutation is flawed. The function `func_2` is supposed to find the index in the permutation, but it relies on the `f` array, which is not properly initialized or updated in the context of the permutation generation.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 14 and `k` is greater than the number of possible permutations. This results in the program outputting an incorrect value or crashing.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct for all potential cases. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 100`, the program might fail to generate the correct permutation or output an incorrect result due to the flawed logic.

To ensure the program works correctly, the generation of lucky numbers and the k-th permutation logic need to be revised to handle all edge cases and ensure the correct sequence is generated.
