You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

One day Petya dreamt of a lexicographically k-th permutation of integers from 1 to n. Determine how many lucky numbers in the permutation are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 109) — the number of elements in the permutation and the lexicographical number of the permutation.

Output

If the k-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the answer to the problem: the number of such indexes i, that i and ai are both lucky numbers.

Examples

Input

7 4


Output

1


Input

4 7


Output

1

Note

A permutation is an ordered set of n elements, where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once. The element of permutation in position with index i is denoted as ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Permutation a is lexicographically smaller that permutation b if there is such a i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), that ai < bi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) aj = bj. Let's make a list of all possible permutations of n elements and sort it in the order of lexicographical increasing. Then the lexicographically k-th permutation is the k-th element of this list of permutations.

In the first sample the permutation looks like that:

1 2 3 4 6 7 5

The only suitable position is 4.

In the second sample the permutation looks like that:

2 1 3 4

The only suitable position is 4.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
