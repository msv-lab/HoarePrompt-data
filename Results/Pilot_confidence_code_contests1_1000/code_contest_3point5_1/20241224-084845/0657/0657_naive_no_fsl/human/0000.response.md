Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and generate the optimal permutation as required. Specifically, the program uses a hardcoded approach to generate the sequence, which does not guarantee that the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers is maximized for all possible inputs.

For instance, consider the input `n = 3` with the sequence `1 2 1`. According to the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime. The optimal permutation for this input would be `1 1 2`, which results in prefix sums of `1, 2, 4`, where only `2` is prime. However, the provided program does not generate this permutation:

- When `n = 3` and the input sequence is `1 2 1`, the program generates `2 1 1` instead.
- The prefix sums for `2 1 1` are `2, 3, 4`, which results in two primes (`2` and `3`).

This shows that the program does not always produce the optimal permutation, and hence it is incorrect.
