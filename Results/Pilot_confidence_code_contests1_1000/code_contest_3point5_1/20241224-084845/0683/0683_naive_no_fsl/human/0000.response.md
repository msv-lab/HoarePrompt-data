Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to maximize the number of games while ensuring no unsuccessful game comes right after a successful one. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the optimal way to remove games. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 0 1 0
```

The expected output should be `3` because Hideo can keep the first, third, and fourth games (1 0 1 0 -> 1 _ 1 0), but the program outputs `2` because it does not properly handle the removal of games to maximize the count.

The program incorrectly appends only '1' or '0' to the output list without considering the optimal sequence of games to retain. It fails to dynamically decide whether to skip a '0' after a '1' or keep it, which is crucial for maximizing the number of games.
