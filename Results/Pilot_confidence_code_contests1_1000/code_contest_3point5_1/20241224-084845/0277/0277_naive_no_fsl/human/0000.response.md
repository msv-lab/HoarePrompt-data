Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the greedy strategy described in the problem. According to the problem, each player always picks the largest available card during their turn. However, the program sorts the list of cards in descending order and then alternates between picking cards from the start and the end of the sorted list. This approach does not always lead to the optimal solution as required by the greedy strategy.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
8 3 7
```

Expected Output:
```
15 10
```

However, the program's output would be:
```
15 3
```

This is incorrect because, according to the greedy strategy, Sereja should pick 8 and 3, giving him a total of 11 points, while Dima should pick 7, giving him 7 points. The program incorrectly calculates the scores by sorting the array and then alternating picks, which does not reflect the actual greedy strategy where each player picks the largest available card in each turn.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific case, making it incorrect.
