You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The teacher gave Anton a large geometry homework, but he didn't do it (as usual) as he participated in a regular round on Codeforces. In the task he was given a set of n lines defined by the equations y = ki·x + bi. It was necessary to determine whether there is at least one point of intersection of two of these lines, that lays strictly inside the strip between x1 < x2. In other words, is it true that there are 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and x', y', such that: 

  * y' = ki * x' + bi, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number i; 
  * y' = kj * x' + bj, that is, point (x', y') belongs to the line number j; 
  * x1 < x' < x2, that is, point (x', y') lies inside the strip bounded by x1 < x2. 



You can't leave Anton in trouble, can you? Write a program that solves the given task.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of lines in the task given to Anton. The second line contains integers x1 and x2 ( - 1 000 000 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 1 000 000) defining the strip inside which you need to find a point of intersection of at least two lines.

The following n lines contain integers ki, bi ( - 1 000 000 ≤ ki, bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the descriptions of the lines. It is guaranteed that all lines are pairwise distinct, that is, for any two i ≠ j it is true that either ki ≠ kj, or bi ≠ bj.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes), if there is at least one intersection of two distinct lines, located strictly inside the strip. Otherwise print "No" (without quotes).

Note

In the first sample there are intersections located on the border of the strip, but there are no intersections located strictly inside it.

    input = sys.stdin
    write = sys.stdout.write
    n = int(input.readline())
    s = input.readline().split()

    for i in range(n):
        s = input.readline().split()
        (k, b) = (int(s[0]), int(s[1]))
        B.append([k * x1 + b, k * x2 + b])
    B.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] * 10 * 15 + x[1])
    c = 'No'
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if B[i + 1][0] != B[i][0]:
            if B[i + 1][1] < B[i][1]:
                c = 'Yes'
    write(c)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
