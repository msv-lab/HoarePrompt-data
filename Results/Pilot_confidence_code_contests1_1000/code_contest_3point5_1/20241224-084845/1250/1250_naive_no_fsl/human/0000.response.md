Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the slopes of the lines are equal but the intercepts are different, which is a valid scenario as per the problem description. Here's an example:

For the input:
```
4
1 2
1 0
0 1
0 2
```

According to the problem description, there should be no intersection point inside the strip, so the output should be "No". However, the program checks if `B[i+1][0] != B[i][0]` and if `B[i+1][1] < B[i][1]`, which is not sufficient to determine if there is an intersection point inside the strip.

Let's consider another example to illustrate the issue:
For the input:
```
2
1 3
1 0
0 2
```

Here, the lines are `y = x` and `y = -x + 2`. The intersection point is `(1, 1)`, which lies inside the strip `1 < x < 3`. However, the program would not detect this intersection because it only checks if the values of `B[i+1][0]` and `B[i][0]` are different and if `B[i+1][1] < B[i][1]`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the intersection point lies strictly within the given strip and also check if the intersection point exists. A more appropriate approach would involve calculating the x-coordinate of the intersection and checking if it lies within the given strip.
