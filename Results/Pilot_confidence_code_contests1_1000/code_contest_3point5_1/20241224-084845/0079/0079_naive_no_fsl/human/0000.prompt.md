You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string s consisting of n capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string s = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in s three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n capital Latin letters.

Output

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string s as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.

Examples

Input

7
ABACABA


Output

AB


Input

5
ZZZAA


Output

ZZ

Note

In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.

In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n):
        gram = s[i - 1:i + 1]
        if d.get(gram) == None:
            d[gram] = 1
        else:
            d[gram] += 1
    a = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(a[0][0])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
