You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n integers.

You can choose any non-negative integer D (i.e. D ≥ 0), and for each a_i you can:

  * add D (only once), i. e. perform a_i := a_i + D, or 
  * subtract D (only once), i. e. perform a_i := a_i - D, or 
  * leave the value of a_i unchanged. 



It is possible that after an operation the value a_i becomes negative.

Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer D and perform changes in such a way, that all a_i are equal (i.e. a_1=a_2=...=a_n).

Print the required D or, if it is impossible to choose such value D, print -1.

For example, for array [2, 8] the value D=3 is minimum possible because you can obtain the array [5, 5] if you will add D to 2 and subtract D from 8. And for array [1, 4, 7, 7] the value D=3 is also minimum possible. You can add it to 1 and subtract it from 7 and obtain the array [4, 4, 4, 4].

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the sequence a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value D such that if you add this value to some a_i, subtract this value from some a_i and leave some a_i without changes, all obtained values become equal.

If it is impossible to choose such value D, print -1.

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] not in s:
            s.append(arr[i])
    s = sorted(s)
    if len(s) > 3:
        print(-1)
    elif len(s) == 2:
        if sum(s) % 2 == 0:
            print((s[1] - s[0]) / 2)
        else:
            print(s[1] - s[0])
    elif len(s) == 3:
        if s[2] - s[1] == s[1] - s[0]:
            print(s[2] - s[1])
        else:
            print(-1)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
