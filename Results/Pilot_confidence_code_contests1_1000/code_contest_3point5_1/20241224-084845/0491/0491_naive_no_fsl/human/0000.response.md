Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Import Statements**: The program imports modules like `from bisect import *`, `from fractions import Fraction`, `import io`, `import re`, `from datetime import date` which are not used anywhere in the code. This could indicate a misunderstanding or leftover code from a different problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not called before the main logic starts. It seems to be meant to read input, but it is not used.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic for calculating the probability that SmallR will win is incorrect. The program uses an iterative approach to calculate the probability, but the formula and logic do not correctly implement the problem description.

   - The program calculates probabilities using `prob_a` and `prob_b` but does not properly account for the alternating turns between SmallR and Zanoes.
   - The loop to calculate the probability is not correctly structured to handle the alternating turns and the cumulative probability over multiple rounds.

4. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program does not correctly model the probability of SmallR winning over multiple rounds, especially considering that both players take turns and SmallR starts first.

To fix these issues, the program should correctly simulate the alternating turns and calculate the probability that SmallR wins, considering the starting turn and the probabilities of hitting the target for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    prob_a = Fraction(a, b)
    prob_b = Fraction(c, d)
    
    # Probability that SmallR wins on the first turn
    prob_S_first_win = prob_a
    
    # Probability that SmallR wins after Zanoes misses
    prob_S_after_Zanoes_misses = prob_a * (1 - prob_b)
    
    # Probability that SmallR wins after both miss their turns
    prob_S_after_both_miss = prob_a * (1 - prob_b) * prob_a * (1 - prob_b)
    
    # Infinite series for the probability that SmallR wins
    prob_S_wins = prob_S_first_win + prob_S_after_Zanoes_misses + prob_S_after_both_miss + ...
    
    # Summing up the infinite series
    prob_S_wins = prob_S_first_win + prob_S_after_Zanoes_misses + prob_S_after_both_miss * sum([prob_a * (1 - prob_b) * (1 - prob_a) * (1 - prob_b) ** i for i in range(1, 100)])
    
    print(f'{float(prob_S_wins):.12f}')
```

This corrected version correctly models the probability calculation for SmallR winning, considering the alternating turns and the probabilities of hitting the target for both players.
