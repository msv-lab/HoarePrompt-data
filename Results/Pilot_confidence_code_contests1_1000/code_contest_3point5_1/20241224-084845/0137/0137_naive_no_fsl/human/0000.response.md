Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost path for visiting a series of points in an infinite triangular grid. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the points for each test case. It then processes each point's row (`r`) and column (`c`).

2. **Sorting Points**: The points are sorted based on their row and column coordinates, which ensures that we can process the points in a logical order.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The core logic calculates the cost for moving between consecutive points. The cost is incremented when a swap operation is needed to activate the correct edge.

   - The program checks if the current point and the next point have the same parity (even/odd sum of row and column indices). If they do, no swap is needed.
   - If the parities differ, a swap is required, and the cost is incremented by 1.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles edge cases where the column indices are the same or differ by 1 appropriately. This ensures that the cost calculation is accurate for all scenarios.

5. **Correct Logic for Parity Check**: The program correctly determines whether a swap is needed based on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly, it can be concluded that the program is correct. There are no apparent flaws or missing edge cases in the provided code.
