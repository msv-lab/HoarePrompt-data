Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of Factorial Calculation**: The `func_2` function uses the formula for combinations (`n choose k`) but does so using floating-point division, which is not appropriate for large values due to precision loss and integer overflow. Instead, it should use modular inverse for division in modular arithmetic.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `raspuns` Calculation**: The logic in the main part of the program does not correctly implement the combinatorial logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the constraints that the last ball of each color must be drawn before the last ball of the next color.

3. **Incomplete Implementation of Combinatorial Logic**: The program does not fully implement the logic to count the number of valid sequences where the last ball of each color is drawn before the last ball of the next color. It attempts to use factorials but in an incorrect manner.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use dynamic programming or combinatorial methods to ensure that the sequence respects the given constraints. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Here's an outline of how a correct solution might look:

1. Use dynamic programming to count valid sequences.
2. Ensure that the sequence respects the constraint that the last ball of each color must be drawn before the last ball of the next color.
3. Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
