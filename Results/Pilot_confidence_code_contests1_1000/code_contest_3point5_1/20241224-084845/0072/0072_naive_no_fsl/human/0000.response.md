Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the rules of the "Snowball" game. Specifically, the program does not generate the sequence of identifiers correctly. The function `func_1` calculates the cumulative number of identifiers said up to a certain point but does not generate the sequence properly. 

The main issue lies in the loop where it attempts to determine the k-th identifier. The logic inside the loop is flawed because it uses the `func_1` function incorrectly and does not generate the sequence of identifiers as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the loop's logic is incomplete and does not handle the sequence generation correctly.

To verify, consider the following example:
- Input: 
  ```
  4 5
  10 4 18 3
  ```

The expected output is 4, but the program does not generate the sequence correctly and thus fails to produce the right identifier. The program's approach to generating the sequence and identifying the k-th element is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.
