You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In late autumn evening n robots gathered in the cheerful company of friends. Each robot has a unique identifier — an integer from 1 to 109.

At some moment, robots decided to play the game "Snowball". Below there are the rules of this game. First, all robots stand in a row. Then the first robot says his identifier. After that the second robot says the identifier of the first robot and then says his own identifier. Then the third robot says the identifier of the first robot, then says the identifier of the second robot and after that says his own. This process continues from left to right until the n-th robot says his identifier.

Your task is to determine the k-th identifier to be pronounced.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(2·109, n·(n + 1) / 2).

The second line contains the sequence id1, id2, ..., idn (1 ≤ idi ≤ 109) — identifiers of roborts. It is guaranteed that all identifiers are different.

Output

Print the k-th pronounced identifier (assume that the numeration starts from 1).

Examples

Input

2 2
1 2


Output

1


Input

4 5
10 4 18 3


Output

4

Note

In the first sample identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order: 1, 1, 2. As k = 2, the answer equals to 1.

In the second test case identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order: 10, 10, 4, 10, 4, 18, 10, 4, 18, 3. As k = 5, the answer equals to 4.
Program:
```
(n, k) = str(raw_input()).split()
(n, k) = (int(n), int(k))
ids = str(raw_input()).split()
for i in range(n, -1, -1):
    j = func_1(i)
    if j < k:
        print(ids[k - j - 1])
        break

def func_1(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
