You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Irina arrived to one of the most famous cities of Berland — the Berlatov city. There are n showplaces in the city, numbered from 1 to n, and some of them are connected by one-directional roads. The roads in Berlatov are designed in a way such that there are no cyclic routes between showplaces.

Initially Irina stands at the showplace 1, and the endpoint of her journey is the showplace n. Naturally, Irina wants to visit as much showplaces as she can during her journey. However, Irina's stay in Berlatov is limited and she can't be there for more than T time units.

Help Irina determine how many showplaces she may visit during her journey from showplace 1 to showplace n within a time not exceeding T. It is guaranteed that there is at least one route from showplace 1 to showplace n such that Irina will spend no more than T time units passing it.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and T (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 109) — the number of showplaces, the number of roads between them and the time of Irina's stay in Berlatov respectively.

The next m lines describes roads in Berlatov. i-th of them contains 3 integers ui, vi, ti (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 109), meaning that there is a road starting from showplace ui and leading to showplace vi, and Irina spends ti time units to pass it. It is guaranteed that the roads do not form cyclic routes.

It is guaranteed, that there is at most one road between each pair of showplaces.

Output

Print the single integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ n) — the maximum number of showplaces that Irina can visit during her journey from showplace 1 to showplace n within time not exceeding T, in the first line.

Print k distinct integers in the second line — indices of showplaces that Irina will visit on her route, in the order of encountering them.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
