Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. The variable `s` is used to store the integer value of `N`, but it is incorrectly read as a string using `raw_input()`. This should be corrected to `int(raw_input())`.

2. The variable `l` is used to store the string `s`, but it is incorrectly read as a string using `raw_input()`. This should be corrected to `raw_input()`.

3. The loop runs from `0` to `int(s) - 1`, which means it will skip the last character of the string `l`. It should run until `int(s)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    b = 0
    r = 0
    for idx in range(0, N):
        if s[idx] == 'R':
            r = r + 1
        else:
            b = b + 1
    if r > b:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

func()
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
