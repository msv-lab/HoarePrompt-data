Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple disjoint segments of disputed cities and Byteland/Berland cities. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to handle only one segment of disputed cities, but the main loop does not account for multiple segments properly.

Consider the following input:
```
5
1 R
2 P
3 P
4 B
5 R
```

For this input, the program should calculate the cost of connecting the cities as follows:
- Connect the disputed cities: \(2 - 1 + 3 - 2 + 4 - 3 = 3\).
- Connect the Byteland cities: \(4 - 1 = 3\).
- Connect the Berland cities: \(5 - 4 = 1\).

The total cost should be \(3 + 3 + 1 = 7\).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost. It only considers the first segment of disputed cities and fails to account for the remaining segments properly. This can be seen in the way the program processes the segments and the calculation of distances.

To fix this, the program needs to process all segments of disputed cities and ensure that all Byteland and Berland cities are connected appropriately.
