Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine which song is playing at a given moment in time. Specifically, the `func_2` function is used to output the results, but it does not actually compute the desired information.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Song Durations**: The list `list1` is supposed to store the cumulative duration of songs up to each point. However, the way `sum1` is updated and `list1` is populated seems to miss the initial zeroth index, making it difficult to directly map the time to the corresponding song.

2. **Incorrect Use of `bisect.bisect_left`**: The function `func_2` uses `bisect.bisect_left` to find the position where the given time fits in the cumulative durations list `list1`. However, it then adds 1 to this index and does not return or print the result, which is essential for the problem.

3. **Lack of Result Output**: Even if the correct index were found, the program does not output the result, relying on the `func_2` function without any actual printing mechanism.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
cumulative_durations = [0]
total_duration = 0

for _ in range(n):
    (c, t) = map(int, input().split())
    total_duration += c * t
    cumulative_durations.append(total_duration)

queries = list(map(int, input().split()))

for query in queries:
    idx = bisect_left(cumulative_durations, query)
    song_number = idx // (cumulative_durations[idx] // total_duration + 1) + 1
    print(song_number)
```

This corrected version properly calculates the cumulative durations and uses binary search to find the correct song index. It then prints the correct song number for each query.
