You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Eugeny loves listening to music. He has n songs in his play list. We know that song number i has the duration of ti minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number i ci times. Eugeny's play list is organized as follows: first song number 1 plays c1 times, then song number 2 plays c2 times, ..., in the end the song number n plays cn times.

Eugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out m moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment x means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the x-th minute of his listening to the play list.

Help Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105). The next n lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers ci, ti (1 ≤ ci, ti ≤ 109) — the description of the play list. It is guaranteed that the play list's total duration doesn't exceed 109 <image>.

The next line contains m positive integers v1, v2, ..., vm, that describe the moments Eugeny has written out. It is guaranteed that there isn't such moment of time vi, when the music doesn't play any longer. It is guaranteed that vi < vi + 1 (i < m).

The moment of time vi means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the vi-th munite from the start of listening to the playlist.

Output

Print m integers — the i-th number must equal the number of the song that was playing during the vi-th minute after Eugeny started listening to the play list.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
