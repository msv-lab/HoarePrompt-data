Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make all integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero. Specifically, the logic for calculating `pos` and `neg` values seems flawed. Here is a counterexample that highlights the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2
1 3
1 -1 1
```

The correct output should be `3`, as explained in the example provided in the problem statement. However, running the given program with this input will not produce the correct result. The program incorrectly calculates the `pos` and `neg` values, leading to an incorrect final answer.
