You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n - 1 edges; this graph should meet the following condition: there exists exactly one shortest (by number of edges) path between any pair of its vertices.

A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of T.

You're given a tree with n vertices. Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree. Initially the integer written on the i-th vertex is equal to vi. In one move you can apply the following operation:

  1. Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1. 
  2. Increase (or decrease) by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree. 



Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero.

Input

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n; ai ≠ bi) indicating there's an edge between vertices ai and bi. It's guaranteed that the input graph is a tree. 

The last line of the input contains a list of n space-separated integers v1, v2, ..., vn (|vi| ≤ 109).

Output

Print the minimum number of operations needed to solve the task.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

        pos[c] = max1
        neg[c] = max2
        s = v[c] - max1 + max2
        if s > 0:
            pos[c] += s

                if not used[i]:
                    canAdd = False
                    break

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
