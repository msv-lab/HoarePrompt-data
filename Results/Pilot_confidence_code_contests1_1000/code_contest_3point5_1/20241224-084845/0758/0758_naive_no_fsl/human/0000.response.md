Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. Specifically, the program fails to handle the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
4
```

This happens because the program only checks if the current character is lowercase and counts consecutive lowercase characters without considering the presence of uppercase letters in between. For instance, in the string `aaaaBaabAbA`, the program will incorrectly include both 'a' positions at index 4 and 5 in the result, even though there is an uppercase 'B' between them.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. This can be achieved by keeping track of the last seen uppercase letter position and ensuring no lowercase letters are added if they come after an uppercase letter within the same group.
