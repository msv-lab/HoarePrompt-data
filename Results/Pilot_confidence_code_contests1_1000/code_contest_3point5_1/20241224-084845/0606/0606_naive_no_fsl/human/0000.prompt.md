You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N people, conveniently numbered 1 through N. They were standing in a row yesterday, but now they are unsure of the order in which they were standing. However, each person remembered the following fact: the absolute difference of the number of the people who were standing to the left of that person, and the number of the people who were standing to the right of that person. According to their reports, the difference above for person i is A_i.

Based on these reports, find the number of the possible orders in which they were standing. Since it can be extremely large, print the answer modulo 10^9+7. Note that the reports may be incorrect and thus there may be no consistent order. In such a case, print 0.

Constraints

* 1≦N≦10^5
* 0≦A_i≦N-1

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the number of the possible orders in which they were standing, modulo 10^9+7.

Examples

Input

Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    flg = [False] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if flg[a[i]] == False:
            flg[a[i]] = True
        elif flg[a[i] - 1] == False and a[i] - 1 >= 0:
            flg[a[i] - 1] = True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        if all(flg):
            print(2 ** (n / 2) % mod)
        else:
            print('0')
    elif all(flg):
        print(2 ** ((n - 1) / 2) % mod)
    else:
        print('0')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
