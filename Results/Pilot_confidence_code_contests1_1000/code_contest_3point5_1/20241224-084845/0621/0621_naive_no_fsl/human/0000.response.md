Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the GCD of LCMs for all pairs of elements in the sequence. Specifically, the program seems to attempt to factorize each element into its prime factors and then compute the GCD of LCMs based on these factors. However, the implementation of `func_1` and the overall logic are flawed.

1. The program uses a fixed upper limit `N = 6` for prime numbers, which is far too small for the range of values in the input (up to 200,000).
2. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the highest power of a prime `p` that divides any element in the list `l`, but it does not correctly handle the computation of the GCD of LCMs for all pairs.
3. The program does not iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` to compute the LCM for each pair and then take the GCD of these LCMs.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:
```
4
10 24 40 80
```
The correct output should be `40`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will not correctly compute this due to the limitations and flaws in its implementation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
