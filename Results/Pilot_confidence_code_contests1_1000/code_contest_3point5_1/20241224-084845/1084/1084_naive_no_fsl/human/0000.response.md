Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the graph formed by the output edges is connected and contains no multiple edges for certain inputs.

Consider the following input:
```
4 5
2 1
3 1
4 0
1 1
5 0
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
2 4
1 4
3 4
3 1
3 2
```

However, this output does not form a valid graph because there are multiple edges between vertex 3 and other vertices, which violates the condition of having no multiple edges. Additionally, the graph is not fully connected; there is no direct path between vertices 1 and 4 through the given edges.

The program should ensure that the graph is constructed correctly by avoiding multiple edges and ensuring connectivity. The current implementation does not guarantee these properties for all inputs, hence it is incorrect.
