Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple pairs or triplets of the same number. According to the problem description, Limak can discard two or three cards with the same number at most once. However, the current implementation only considers the maximum value among the counts of 2 or 3 for discarding. This means it might miss cases where discarding another pair or triplet would result in a smaller sum.

For example, consider the input `7 3 7 3 3`. The current program would discard one pair of 7s (summing to 14), but it could also discard both pairs of 3s (summing to 6), resulting in a smaller sum of 26 instead of 28. Therefore, the program is not correct for this case.
