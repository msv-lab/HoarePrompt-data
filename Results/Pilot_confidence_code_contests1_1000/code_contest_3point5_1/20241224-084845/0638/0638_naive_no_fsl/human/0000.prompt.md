You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A little bear Limak plays a game. He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.

Limak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.

He is allowed to at most once discard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.

Given five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?

Input

The only line of the input contains five integers t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5 (1 ≤ ti ≤ 100) — numbers written on cards.

Output

Print the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards.

Examples

Input

7 3 7 3 20


Output

26


Input

7 9 3 1 8


Output

28


Input

10 10 10 10 10


Output

20

Note

In the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20. Limak can do one of the following.

  * Do nothing and the sum would be 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40. 
  * Remove two cards with a number 7. The remaining sum would be 3 + 3 + 20 = 26. 
  * Remove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34. 



You are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26.

In the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28.

In the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is 10 + 10 = 20.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    cards = map(int, raw_input().split())
    c = Counter(cards)
    c = c.most_common(5)
    if len(c) == 5:
        print(sum(cards))
        exit(0)
    _max = 0
    for (card, _count) in c:
        if _count in [2, 3]:
            _max = max(_max, card * min(_count, 3))
    print(sum(cards) - _max)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
