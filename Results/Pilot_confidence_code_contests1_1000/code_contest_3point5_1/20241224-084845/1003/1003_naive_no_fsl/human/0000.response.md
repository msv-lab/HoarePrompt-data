Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not properly simulate the coin toss-based operations as required.

1. **Incorrect Permutation Application Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to apply the permutation `q` to the current board permutation `a`. However, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed. It should perform the operation `a[i] = q[a[i]]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, but the current implementation is incorrect.
   - Similarly, the function `func_3` is intended to apply the inverse of the permutation `q` to the current board permutation `a`. The implementation of `func_3` is also incorrect. It should perform the operation `a[q[i]] = b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, but the current implementation is not doing this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the sequence of moves based on coin tosses. It checks for the presence of Masha's permutation `p` after each move but does not properly account for the alternating application of `q` and its inverse as described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
def func_2(a, q):
    n = len(a) - 1
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        b[i] = a[q[i]]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = b[i]

def func_3(a, q):
    n = len(a) - 1
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        b[q[i]] = a[i]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = b[i]
```

With these corrections, the program would be able to properly simulate the coin toss-based operations and check if Masha's permutation appears on the board after exactly `k` moves.
