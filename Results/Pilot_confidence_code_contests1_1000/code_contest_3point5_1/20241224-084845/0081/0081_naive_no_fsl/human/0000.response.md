Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the satisfaction points gained from consecutive dishes are added. Specifically, the line `print(C[i - 1])` is unnecessary and incorrect. The program should directly add `C[i - 1]` to `res` instead of printing it. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input().split()[0])
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    res = 0
    for i in range(N):
        res += B[A[i] - 1]
        if i > 0 and A[i] == A[i - 1] + 1:
            res += C[A[i - 1] - 1]
    print(res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the original program, the line `print(C[i - 1])` is causing the program to print the additional satisfaction points for each consecutive pair, which is not required according to the problem description. This extra print statement is not needed and leads to incorrect output formatting.
