Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that `p_i` is not equal to `p_{(i mod n) + 1}` for all `i`. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  1 1 1
  2 2 2
  3 3 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  Any permutation of `[1, 2, 3]` that satisfies the conditions.

- **Actual Output:**
  The program generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, but it does not check if the last element is different from the first element. In this case, the output is `[1, 2, 3]`, which violates the condition `p_1 ≠ p_{i mod n + 1}` since `p_1 = 1` and `p_3 = 3`.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check and adjust the last element to ensure it is different from the first element. Here’s an updated version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_13():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        a = func_6()
        b = func_6()
        c = func_6()
        l = []
        l.extend(a)
        for i in range(1, n):
            if l[i] == l[i - 1]:
                l[i] = b[i]
        if l[0] == l[n - 1]:
            l[n - 1] = c[n - 1]
        if l[n - 2] == l[n - 1]:
            l[n - 1] = b[n - 1]
        # Ensure p_1 ≠ p_n
        if l[0] == l[-1]:
            l[-1] = b[-1] if l[-1] != b[-1] else c[-1]
        func_14(*l)
```

With this modification, the program ensures that the last element is different from the first element, thereby satisfying the required condition.
