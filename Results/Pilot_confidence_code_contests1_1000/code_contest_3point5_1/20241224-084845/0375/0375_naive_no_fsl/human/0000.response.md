Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the general case where the input size is not fixed to 9 or 6. The program checks for exactly 9 and 6 inputs and prints 3 and 4 respectively, but it will fail for any other input size. According to the problem description, the output should depend on the number of hard cheeses, not the total number of cheeses. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
parmesan hard
emmental hard
edam hard
colby hard
gruyere hard
```

The program would print `4`, but the correct output should be `5` since there are 5 hard cheeses. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
