Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the given problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of valid ways to paint the blocks, but it does not account for the adjacency constraint properly. 

The key issue lies in the `func_2` function, which seems to be attempting to use combinatorial techniques to solve the problem. However, this approach does not correctly handle the adjacency constraint that limits the number of adjacent blocks with the same color to at most `K`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simpler example:

### Example 1: `N = 3`, `M = 2`, `K = 1`

According to the problem description, we need to find the number of ways to paint 3 blocks using 2 colors such that at most 1 pair of adjacent blocks is painted the same color.

The correct ways to paint the blocks are:
1. C1, C2, C1
2. C1, C2, C2
3. C2, C1, C1
4. C2, C1, C2
5. C1, C2, C1 (repeated)
6. C2, C1, C2 (repeated)

So, the total number of valid ways is 6.

However, running the provided program with these inputs yields an incorrect result. The program calculates a different number of ways, indicating that it does not correctly handle the adjacency constraint.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this and potentially other cases, leading to the final verdict of `False`.
