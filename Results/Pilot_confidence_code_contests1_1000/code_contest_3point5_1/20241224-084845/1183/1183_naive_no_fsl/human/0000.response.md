Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple subtrees need to be colored differently but share a common ancestor. Specifically, the program uses a single DFS traversal to count the number of steps required, which fails to account for the optimal coloring strategy.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
1 2 2 1 5
2 1 1 1 1 1
```

The correct output should be 3, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will incorrectly output 1 because it only counts the distinct colors in the tree without considering the optimal coloring strategy.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it identifies and counts the minimum number of steps required to color each subtree independently when they require different colors. The current implementation does not achieve this, making the program incorrect.
