Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple try-catch blocks can be active for the same exception type. Specifically, the program only checks if the `counter` is zero before returning the message from the `catch` block. However, according to the problem description, the catch block whose `catch` operator occurs earliest should be activated if there are multiple such blocks.

For example, consider the following input:
```
8
try
    try
        throw ( AE ) 
    catch ( BE, "BE in line 3")

    try
    catch(AE, "AE in line 5") 
catch(AE,"AE somewhere")
```

The program should output "AE in line 5" because the catch block `catch(AE, "AE in line 5")` occurs earlier than `catch(AE, "AE somewhere")`. However, the current implementation returns "AE somewhere".

The correct implementation should ensure that the catch block with the earliest occurrence is chosen when multiple catch blocks match the exception type.
