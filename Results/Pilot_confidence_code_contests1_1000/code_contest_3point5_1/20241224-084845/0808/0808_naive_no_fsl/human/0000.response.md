Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in its implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Specifically, the range for marking non-prime numbers starts from `i ** 2 - 1` instead of `i ** 2`. This means that some numbers will not be correctly marked as non-prime, leading to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `10`, the expected output should be `4` (primes: 2, 3, 5, 7), but the program might incorrectly count fewer primes due to this off-by-one error.
