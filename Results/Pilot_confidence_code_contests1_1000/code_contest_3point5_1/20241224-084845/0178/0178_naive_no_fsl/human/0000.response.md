Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the comparison `if col[i] > lig[j]:` should compare the column sum with the row sum of the same square, not the entire row sum. The current implementation compares the column sum with the sum of the entire row, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The correct output should be 3, as all squares are winning. However, the program will incorrectly count fewer winning squares due to the flawed comparison logic.
