You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A social network for dogs called DH (DogHouse) has k special servers to recompress uploaded videos of cute cats. After each video is uploaded, it should be recompressed on one (any) of the servers, and only after that it can be saved in the social network.

We know that each server takes one second to recompress a one minute fragment. Thus, any server takes m seconds to recompress a m minute video.

We know the time when each of the n videos were uploaded to the network (in seconds starting from the moment all servers started working). All videos appear at different moments of time and they are recompressed in the order they appear. If some video appeared at time s, then its recompressing can start at that very moment, immediately. Some videos can await recompressing when all the servers are busy. In this case, as soon as a server is available, it immediately starts recompressing another video. The videos that await recompressing go in a queue. If by the moment the videos started being recompressed some servers are available, then any of them starts recompressing the video.

For each video find the moment it stops being recompressed.

Input

The first line of the input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5·105) — the number of videos and servers, respectively.

Next n lines contain the descriptions of the videos as pairs of integers si, mi (1 ≤ si, mi ≤ 109), where si is the time in seconds when the i-th video appeared and mi is its duration in minutes. It is guaranteed that all the si's are distinct and the videos are given in the chronological order of upload, that is in the order of increasing si.

Output

Print n numbers e1, e2, ..., en, where ei is the time in seconds after the servers start working, when the i-th video will be recompressed.

    servers = [0] * k
    times = []
    for i in range(n):
        (s, m) = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
        time = max(servers[0], s)
        heapq.heapreplace(servers, time + m)
        times.append(time + m)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
