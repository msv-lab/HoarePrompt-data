Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where sentences are split across multiple messages correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that if a sentence cannot fit entirely within the current message, it should start a new message, but the existing code does not properly handle this scenario. 

For example, consider the input:
```
19
Hello! Do you like fish? Why?
```

The correct output should be `3` because the text needs to be split into three messages: `"Hello!"`, `"Do you like fish?"`, and `"Why?"`. However, the given program might fail to handle this case correctly due to its logic for counting spaces and sentence lengths. The program needs to ensure that each sentence fits entirely within a message before moving to the next one.
