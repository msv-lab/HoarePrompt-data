You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fangy the little walrus, as all the modern walruses, loves to communicate via text messaging. One day he faced the following problem: When he sends large texts, they are split into parts each containing n characters (which is the size of one text message). Thus, whole sentences and words get split!

Fangy did not like it, so he faced the task of breaking the text into minimal messages on his own so that no sentence were broken into pieces when it is sent and the number of text messages to be sent would be minimal. If two consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them can be ignored (Fangy does not write this space).

The little walrus's text looks in the following manner: 
    
    
    TEXT ::= SENTENCE | SENTENCE SPACE TEXT  
    SENTENCE ::= WORD SPACE SENTENCE | WORD END  
    END ::= {'.', '?', '!'}  
    WORD ::= LETTER | LETTER WORD  
    LETTER ::= {'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z'}  
    SPACE ::= ' '  
    

SPACE stands for the symbol of a space.

So, how many messages did Fangy send?

Input

The first line contains an integer n, which is the size of one message (2 ≤ n ≤ 255). The second line contains the text. The length of the text does not exceed 104 characters. It is guaranteed that the text satisfies the above described format. Specifically, this implies that the text is not empty.

Output

On the first and only line print the number of text messages Fangy will need. If it is impossible to split the text, print "Impossible" without the quotes.

Examples

Input

25
Hello. I am a little walrus.


Output

2


Input

2
How are you?


Output

Impossible


Input

19
Hello! Do you like fish? Why?


Output

3

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. The text will be split into three messages: "Hello!", "Do you like fish?" and "Why?".
Program:
```
import re

def func():
    n = input()
    q = [len(x) for x in map(str.strip, re.split('[\\.!?]', raw_input()))][:-1]
    (c, m, f) = [q[0] + 1, 1, 0]
    if c > n:
        f = 1
    for i in xrange(1, len(q)):
        if c + len(' ') + q[i] + len('.') > n:
            m += 1
            c = q[i] + len('.')
            if c > n:
                f = 1
        else:
            if m == 0:
                m = 1
            c += len(' ') + q[i] + len('.')
    print[m, 'Impossible'][f]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
