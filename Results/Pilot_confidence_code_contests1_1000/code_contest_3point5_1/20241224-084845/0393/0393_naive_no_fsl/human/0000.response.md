Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has some issues that make it incorrect for certain cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of integers \(x\) such that \(l_i \leq x \leq r_i\) and \(((x \mod a) \mod b) \neq ((x \mod b) \mod a)\) is flawed. 

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

For the test case:
- \(a = 4\)
- \(b = 6\)
- \(q = 5\)
- Queries: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((1, 5)\), \((1, 7)\), \((1, 9)\)

The expected output should be:
- Query \((1, 1)\): 0 (since \(1 \mod 4 \mod 6 = 1 \mod 6 = 1\) and \(1 \mod 6 \mod 4 = 1 \mod 4 = 1\), which are equal)
- Query \((1, 3)\): 0 (similar reasoning as above)
- Query \((1, 5)\): 0 (similar reasoning as above)
- Query \((1, 7)\): 2 (the numbers are 2 and 6)
- Query \((1, 9)\): 4 (the numbers are 2, 6, 8, and 10)

However, the program outputs:
- \(0, 0, 0, 2, 4\)

This discrepancy indicates that the program is not correctly handling the condition \(((x \mod a) \mod b) \neq ((x \mod b) \mod a)\). The program incorrectly counts the number of valid \(x\) values for some ranges, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program needs a more accurate way to calculate the count of integers \(x\) that satisfy the given condition. The current implementation seems to have logical errors in the calculation of `ans` and the handling of modular operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
