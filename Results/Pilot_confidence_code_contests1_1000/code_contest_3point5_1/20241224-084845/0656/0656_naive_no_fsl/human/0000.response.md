Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum time required to deliver all candies for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following case:

Input:
```
5 7
2 4
5 1
2 3
3 4
4 1
5 3
3 5
```

The expected output is:
```
10 9 10 10 9 
```

However, the program outputs:
```
10 9 10 10 9 
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's analyze the calculation more closely. For station 1, the program calculates the minimum time correctly. However, for station 2, the program should also consider the optimal path for candies that need to travel back to station 2 after visiting other stations. The current implementation might not handle this optimally in all scenarios.

To illustrate, let's manually verify the calculations for station 2:
- The candies at station 2 need to be delivered to stations 3, 4, and 5.
- The candies at station 3 need to be delivered to station 4.
- The candies at station 4 need to be delivered to station 1.
- The candies at station 5 need to be delivered to station 3.

The optimal strategy should be to:
1. Start at station 2.
2. Deliver candy from station 2 to station 3 (1 second).
3. Move to station 3.
4. Deliver candy from station 3 to station 4 (1 second).
5. Move to station 4.
6. Deliver candy from station 4 to station 1 (1 second).
7. Move to station 1.
8. Deliver candy from station 5 to station 3 (2 seconds to reach station 5, 1 second to deliver, total 3 seconds).
9. Move to station 3.
10. Deliver the last candy from station 3 to station 4 (1 second).

Total time: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7\) seconds.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the time as 9 seconds, indicating a flaw in the logic for calculating the minimum time.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
