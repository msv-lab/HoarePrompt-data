Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required number of candles `r` exceeds the burning duration `t`. Specifically, the program checks if `r > t` and prints `-1` immediately, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of candles needed for the remaining cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5 4
1 3 6
```

In this case, `r = 4` and `t = 5`, so it is theoretically possible to light candles such that at least 4 candles are burning during each visit. However, the program will incorrectly print `-1` because it checks `r > t` first and does not proceed to calculate the correct number of candles needed.
