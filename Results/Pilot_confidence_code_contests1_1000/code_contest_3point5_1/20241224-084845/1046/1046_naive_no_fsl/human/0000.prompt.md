You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

    Hence the recurrence relation is as follows:

    This can be read as "the number of portal jumps to get from room i with an odd
    number of crosses to an even number of crosses is equivalent to taking a portal
    jump to room p(i) into an odd number of crosees (+1), getting back into that

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
