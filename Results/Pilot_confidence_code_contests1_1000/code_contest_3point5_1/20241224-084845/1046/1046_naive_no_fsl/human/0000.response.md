Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses floating-point arithmetic (`1000000000.0 + 7`) instead of integer arithmetic, which can lead to incorrect results due to precision issues. Additionally, the recurrence relation and the logic for calculating the number of portal jumps are incorrect.

To illustrate, let's consider the third example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `62`

The program incorrectly calculates the number of portal jumps. The correct calculation should be done using integer arithmetic and the logic should follow the problem description accurately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(line):
    while True:
        n = int(next(line).strip())
        P = [int(p_i) - 1 for p_i in next(line).split()]
        yield (n, P)

def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        portal_jumps = 1
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            portal_jumps += dp[j] + 1
        dp[i] = portal_jumps % 1000000007
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps += dp[i]
        total_pjumps %= 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, P) = next(func_1(sys.stdin))
    func_2(n, P)
```

This corrected version ensures that all calculations are done using integer arithmetic and follows the problem description accurately.
