Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required for the game described. Specifically, the function `func_4` is not correctly identifying non-trivial divisors and determining the winning player. Here are some issues:

1. **Non-trivial Divisors**: The function `func_4` attempts to find divisors but does not correctly identify non-trivial divisors. For instance, when checking for divisors of a number, it includes 1 and the number itself, which should be excluded for non-trivial divisors.

2. **Winning Logic**: The logic to determine the winner is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that having more than two non-trivial divisors gives the first player an advantage, but this does not always hold true based on the rules of the game.

3. **Example Counterexample**: Consider the input `q = 8`. The divisors of 8 are 2 and 4. Since 8 has more than one non-trivial divisor, the first player can choose either 2 or 4. If the first player chooses 2, the second player is left with 4, which has no non-trivial divisors (only 1 and 4), leading to the second player's win. However, the program incorrectly determines that the first player wins and suggests an initial move, which is not valid based on the game rules.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly identify non-trivial divisors and properly simulate the game moves to determine the winner.
