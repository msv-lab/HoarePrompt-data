Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a station has multiple candies with the same destination but different starting positions correctly. Specifically, the program calculates `max_candy[i]` based on the distance and does not account for the fact that multiple candies can share the same destination but have different starting points, which might require more time to deliver all candies.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 4
1 5
2 5
3 5
4 5
```

The expected output should be:

```
4 4 4 4 4
```

However, the current implementation will calculate the time based on the closest candy to the starting station, which might not be correct if there are multiple candies with the same destination. The program does not ensure that the train picks up all candies for a particular destination before moving to the next station, leading to potential underestimation of the required time.
