Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input is empty or contains invalid characters. According to the problem description, the input `S_i` can only be `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`. However, the program does not validate the input strings, and it will raise a `ValueError` if an invalid string is encountered. This can be demonstrated with the following test case:

Input:
```
6
AC
TLE
AC
AC
WA
invalid
```

The program will raise a `ValueError` because `'invalid'` is not one of the valid verdicts. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for handling all potential cases, making it incorrect.
