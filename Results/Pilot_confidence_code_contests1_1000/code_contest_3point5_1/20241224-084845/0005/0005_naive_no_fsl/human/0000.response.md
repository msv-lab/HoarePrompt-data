Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. The key issue lies in the use of the `order_tree` class and its methods, which seem to be misapplied to solve the problem.

1. **Misuse of `order_tree`**: The `order_tree` class is intended to maintain a segment tree, but the way it is used does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the `query` and `update` methods are not correctly implemented to track the minimum distances between points over time.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the sum of minimum distances by iterating through the points in reverse order and querying the segment tree. However, this approach does not accurately capture the minimum distance between each pair of points over all possible times.

3. **Example Case Where Program Fails**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 3 2
     -100 2 3
     ```
   - Expected output: `3`
   - Actual output: The program might produce an incorrect result due to the misapplication of the segment tree.

To correctly solve this problem, one should focus on calculating the minimum distance between each pair of points at the moment they are closest to each other. This involves sorting the points by their initial coordinates and speeds, and then determining the closest approach for each pair.

Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
n = int(input())
points = sorted([(x, v) for x, v in zip(map(int, input().split()), map(int, input().split()))])

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        xi, vi = points[i]
        xj, vj = points[j]
        # Calculate the time when they are closest
        if vi == vj:
            if xi != xj:
                ans += abs(xi - xj)
        else:
            t = (xi - xj) / (vj - vi)
            ans += abs(vi * t + xi - (vj * t + xj))
print(ans)
```

This approach directly calculates the minimum distance for each pair of points without relying on the `order_tree` class, ensuring the correct calculation of the sum of minimum distances.
