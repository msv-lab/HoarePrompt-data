Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of clients Valera can serve given the constraints. It sorts the clients based on their total memory requirement and iteratively selects clients whose total memory requirement fits within the available camera memory. The program handles all described cases:

1. It reads the necessary inputs correctly.
2. It calculates the total memory required for each client.
3. It sorts the clients based on their memory requirements.
4. It iterates through the sorted list and selects clients until the camera memory is insufficient.
5. It prints the correct number of clients and their indices.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, this implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without any omissions or logical errors.
