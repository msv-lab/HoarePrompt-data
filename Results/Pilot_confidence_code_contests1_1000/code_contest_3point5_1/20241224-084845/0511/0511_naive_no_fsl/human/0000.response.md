Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for solving the problem described. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to sort and process an array of inputs in a way that is unrelated to the problem's requirements. 

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of apple pies that can be made given `A` apples and `P` pieces of apple, where each apple can be cut into three pieces and two pieces are needed to make one pie. However, the given program does not perform this calculation at all. Instead, it reads multiple lines of input, splits them, sorts and processes arrays, and prints results which do not relate to the problem statement.

To verify this, consider the example inputs:

- For the input `1 3`, the correct output should be `3` because we can cut the single apple into three pieces, making one pie, and using the additional three pieces to make another two pies. The provided program would not produce this output.
- For the input `0 1`, the correct output is `0` since we cannot make any pies without both apples and pieces of apple. Again, the provided program would not produce this output.

Since the program does not implement the required logic and fails to produce the correct output for the given examples, it is incorrect.
