You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dreamoon likes coloring cells very much.

There is a row of n cells. Initially, all cells are empty (don't contain any color). Cells are numbered from 1 to n.

You are given an integer m and m integers l_1, l_2, …, l_m (1 ≤ l_i ≤ n)

Dreamoon will perform m operations.

In i-th operation, Dreamoon will choose a number p_i from range [1, n-l_i+1] (inclusive) and will paint all cells from p_i to p_i+l_i-1 (inclusive) in i-th color. Note that cells may be colored more one than once, in this case, cell will have the color from the latest operation.

Dreamoon hopes that after these m operations, all colors will appear at least once and all cells will be colored. Please help Dreamoon to choose p_i in each operation to satisfy all constraints.

Input

The first line contains two integers n,m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100 000).

The second line contains m integers l_1, l_2, …, l_m (1 ≤ l_i ≤ n).

Output

If it's impossible to perform m operations to satisfy all constraints, print "'-1" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print m integers p_1, p_2, …, p_m (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n - l_i + 1), after these m operations, all colors should appear at least once and all cells should be colored.

If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    arr = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    sums = [0] * (m + 1)
    l = 0
    res = []
    for i in xrange(m - 1, -1, -1):
        sums[i] = sums[i + 1] + arr[i]
    for i in xrange(m):
        res.append(max(i, n - sums[i]) + 1)
    stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
