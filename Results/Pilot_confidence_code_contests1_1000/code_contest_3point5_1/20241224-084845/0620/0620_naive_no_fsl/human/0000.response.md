Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that all cells are colored and all colors appear at least once after performing the m operations.

Let's consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
5 3
3 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 4 1
```

This is a valid solution as it ensures all cells are colored and all colors appear at least once.

However, let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
10 1
1
```

According to the problem description, with `n=10` and `m=1`, Dreamoon needs to paint a segment of length 1. The only possible value for `p_1` is 1 to 10. But the program outputs `-1` in this case, which is incorrect because it is possible to paint the cell 1 and fulfill the conditions.

The program logic seems to be flawed in handling the case where `m=1`. It directly checks if it can paint a segment of length equal to `l_1` without considering the possibility of painting a single cell.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle certain edge cases properly.
