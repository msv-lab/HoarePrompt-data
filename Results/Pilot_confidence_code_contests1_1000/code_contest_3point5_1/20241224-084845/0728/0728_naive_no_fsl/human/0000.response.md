Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to calculate a correction factor `c`, but its logic is incorrect for the given problem.

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to return a prime number less than `a`, but it incorrectly checks for prime numbers.
   - For example, when `a = 2`, the function returns 1, which is not a prime number.
   - When `a = 4`, the function returns 3, which is correct.
   - However, the logic of checking for primes is flawed because it uses a nested loop that does not properly check for divisibility by all numbers up to `i // 2`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the number of distinct integers that can be represented using `n` roman digits.
   - The formula `(n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n + 3) / 6` is used to calculate the total number of combinations, but it needs to be adjusted by subtracting the correction factor `c`.
   - The correction factor `c` is supposed to account for overcounted values, but the way `func_1` is implemented leads to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider `n = 2`:
- The correct answer should be 10 (as per the example in the problem description).
- However, the program might return an incorrect value due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

To correctly solve this problem, the function `func_1` should not be used, and a different approach should be taken to handle the overcounting of values. The main logic should directly compute the number of distinct integers without the need for a correction factor that is calculated incorrectly.
