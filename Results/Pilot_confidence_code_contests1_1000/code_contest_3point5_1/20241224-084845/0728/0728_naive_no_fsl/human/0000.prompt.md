You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's introduce a number system which is based on a roman digits. There are digits I, V, X, L which correspond to the numbers 1, 5, 10 and 50 respectively. The use of other roman digits is not allowed.

Numbers in this system are written as a sequence of one or more digits. We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it.

For example, the number XXXV evaluates to 35 and the number IXI — to 12.

Pay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system — in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for example IX means 11, not 9.

One can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented by exactly n roman digits I, V, X, L.

Input

The only line of the input file contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of roman digits to use.

Output

Output a single integer — the number of distinct integers which can be represented using n roman digits exactly.

Examples

Input

1


Output

4


Input

2


Output

10


Input

10


Output

244

Note

In the first sample there are exactly 4 integers which can be represented — I, V, X and L.

In the second sample it is possible to represent integers 2 (II), 6 (VI), 10 (VV), 11 (XI), 15 (XV), 20 (XX), 51 (IL), 55 (VL), 60 (XL) and 100 (LL).
Program:
```
n = int(input())
c = func_1(n)
if not c:
    c = 1
print(int((n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n + 3) / 6) - c * (c - 1))

def func_1(a):
    for i in range(a - 1, 0, -1):
        tf = True
        for j in range(2, i // 2):
            if i % j == 0:
                tf = False
                break
        if tf:
            return i


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
