Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the entire matrix is filled with 1s. In such a scenario, the output should be `0` since there are no 0s in the matrix to form a square. However, the current implementation will still attempt to find a square of zeros and may incorrectly return a non-zero value.

To verify this, consider the following input:

Input:

```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
```

The expected output is `0`, but the current program will not produce this result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
