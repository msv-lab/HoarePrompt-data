Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not correctly calculate the maximum amount of gold each spaceship can steal. 

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_15` correctly reads the number of spaceships `n` and bases `m`, followed by the attacking powers of the spaceships and the details of the bases.
2. **Sorting and Matching**: The function sorts the attacking powers of the spaceships and the defensive powers of the bases. It then iterates through both lists to determine which bases each spaceship can attack and calculates the total gold that can be stolen.

However, the logic for determining the maximum gold each spaceship can steal is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Gold**: The function uses a nested loop to match each spaceship with the bases it can attack, but it does not correctly accumulate the gold from the bases that the spaceship can attack. Instead, it seems to be trying to match the attacking power of the spaceships with the defensive power of the bases, which is not the correct approach.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_3()
    a = func_4()
    bases = [func_4() for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Sort bases by defensive power
    bases.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        gold_stolen = 0
        for base in bases:
            if a[i] >= base[0]:  # Check if the spaceship can attack the base
                gold_stolen += base[1]  # Add the gold of the base to the total
                bases.remove(base)  # Remove the base since it's already counted
            else:
                break  # No need to check further bases for this spaceship
        results.append(gold_stolen)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result, end=' ')
```

This corrected logic ensures that each spaceship is matched with the highest possible gold bases it can attack, and the gold is accumulated correctly. Without this fix, the program will fail to provide the correct output for some cases. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
