You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Heidi and Doctor Who hopped out of the TARDIS and found themselves at EPFL in 2018. They were surrounded by stormtroopers and Darth Vader was approaching. Miraculously, they managed to escape to a nearby rebel base but the Doctor was very confused. Heidi reminded him that last year's HC2 theme was Star Wars. Now he understood, and he's ready to face the evils of the Empire!

The rebels have s spaceships, each with a certain attacking power a.

They want to send their spaceships to destroy the empire bases and steal enough gold and supplies in order to keep the rebellion alive.

The empire has b bases, each with a certain defensive power d, and a certain amount of gold g.

A spaceship can attack all the bases which have a defensive power less than or equal to its attacking power.

If a spaceship attacks a base, it steals all the gold in that base.

The rebels are still undecided which spaceship to send out first, so they asked for the Doctor's help. They would like to know, for each spaceship, the maximum amount of gold it can steal.

Input

The first line contains integers s and b (1 ≤ s, b ≤ 10^5), the number of spaceships and the number of bases, respectively.

The second line contains s integers a (0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9), the attacking power of each spaceship.

The next b lines contain integers d, g (0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ g ≤ 10^4), the defensive power and the gold of each base, respectively.

Output

Print s integers, the maximum amount of gold each spaceship can steal, in the same order as the spaceships are given in the input.

Example

Input


5 4
1 3 5 2 4
0 1
4 2
2 8
9 4


Output


1 9 11 9 11

Note

The first spaceship can only attack the first base.

The second spaceship can attack the first and third bases.

The third spaceship can attack the first, second and third bases.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
