Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not check if the sequence of 'N's can be formed by replacing '?' with 'N' in such a way that the sequence still respects the original '?' positions. Consider the following input:

```
7 3
Y?NNYYN
```

For this input, the program should output "YES" because Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly 3 if he has watched the second episode and the sixth episode, and is unsure about the third, fourth, and fifth episodes. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly handle this scenario. It only checks for a continuous sequence of 'N's without considering the original '?' positions.

To fix this, `func_2` needs to ensure that the sequence of 'N's can be formed by replacing '?' with 'N' while maintaining the original sequence constraints.
