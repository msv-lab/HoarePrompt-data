Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid ways to increase the lengths of the sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the number of ways to increase the length of stick `a` while keeping `b` and `c` fixed, but this approach does not account for all possible combinations of increasing the lengths of the sticks.

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, `l = 1`

According to the problem description, we should be able to form a non-degenerate triangle by either:
1. Increasing `a` by 1.
2. Increasing `b` by 1.
3. Increasing `c` by 1.
4. Increasing `a` and `b` by 1 each.

However, the program only considers increasing each stick individually and does not account for increasing multiple sticks simultaneously within the limit of `l`. This leads to an incorrect count.

To verify this, let's manually check the valid configurations:
- Increase `a` by 1: New lengths are (2, 2, 3), forming a non-degenerate triangle.
- Increase `b` by 1: New lengths are (1, 3, 3), forming a non-degenerate triangle.
- Increase `c` by 1: New lengths are (1, 2, 4), which is invalid.
- Increase `a` and `b` by 1 each: New lengths are (2, 3, 3), forming a non-degenerate triangle.

Thus, there are 3 valid configurations, not the result produced by the given program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
