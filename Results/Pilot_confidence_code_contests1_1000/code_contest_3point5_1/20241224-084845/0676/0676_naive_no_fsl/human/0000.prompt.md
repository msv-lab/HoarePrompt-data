You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three sticks with positive integer lengths of a, b, and c centimeters. You can increase length of some of them by some positive integer number of centimeters (different sticks can be increased by a different length), but in total by at most l centimeters. In particular, it is allowed not to increase the length of any stick.

Determine the number of ways to increase the lengths of some sticks so that you can form from them a non-degenerate (that is, having a positive area) triangle. Two ways are considered different, if the length of some stick is increased by different number of centimeters in them.

Input

The single line contains 4 integers a, b, c, l (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 3·105, 0 ≤ l ≤ 3·105).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of ways to increase the sizes of the sticks by the total of at most l centimeters, so that you can make a non-degenerate triangle from it.

Examples

Input

2


Input

10 2 1 7


Output

0

Note

In the first sample test you can either not increase any stick or increase any two sticks by 1 centimeter.

In the second sample test you can increase either the first or the second stick by one centimeter. Note that the triangle made from the initial sticks is degenerate and thus, doesn't meet the conditions.
Program:
```
(a, b, c, l) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print((l + 1) * (l + 2) * (l + 3)) / 6 - func_1(a, b, c, l) - func_1(b, a, c, l) - func_1(c, a, b, l)

def func_1(a, b, c, l):
    res = 0
    lb = max(a, b + c)
    ub = a + l
    for i in xrange(lb, ub + 1):
        temp = i - a
        x = min(a - b - c + temp, l - temp)
        if x >= 0:
            res += (x + 1) * (x + 2) / 2
    return res


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
