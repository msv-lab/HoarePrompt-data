Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input constraints and logic. Specifically, the program attempts to insert elements into `ans` based on the value of `s[i][1]`, which is the number of taller people in front of the person. However, this approach does not guarantee that the heights will be correctly assigned based on the relative positions of the people.

Consider the following input:
```
4
vasya 0
petya 1
manya 3
dunay 3
```

In this case, the program will output `-1` because it incorrectly checks if `int(s[i][1]) > i`, which is not the correct logic for determining the order and heights. The correct logic would involve ensuring that the number of taller people in front matches the given conditions.

A more appropriate approach would involve sorting the people based on the number of taller people in front and then assigning heights accordingly, ensuring that the conditions are met.
