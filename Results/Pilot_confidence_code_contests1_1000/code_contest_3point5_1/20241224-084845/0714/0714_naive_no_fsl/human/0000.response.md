Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to account for the prime numbers within the query range \([l, r]\) and compute the required sum \( \sum_{p \in P} f(p) \), where \( P \) is the set of prime numbers between \( l \) and \( r \).

The program calculates the prefix sums of how many numbers in the array are divisible by each number up to 10^7, but it does not correctly identify and sum the contributions of only the prime numbers within the query range. Instead, it simply uses the precomputed prefix sums without filtering for primes.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
6
5 5 7 10 14 15
3
2 11
3 12
4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
7
0
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not filter out non-prime numbers when computing the sum.

A correct solution would involve identifying the prime numbers in the query range and then using the precomputed prefix sums to calculate the required function \( f(p) \) for each prime number \( p \) in that range.
