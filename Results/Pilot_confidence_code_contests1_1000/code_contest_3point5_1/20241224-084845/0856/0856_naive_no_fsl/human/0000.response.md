Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the cases where the text becomes invalid after a series of commands. Specifically, the program does not properly check if the text is a correct text after each command. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
6
(R)a(L)R
```

Expected output:
```
-1 -1 -1 1 1 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

This happens because the program only checks if the text is correct at the end of the sequence of commands, but it should check after each command. The issue arises when the cursor is moved to a position where the text is no longer correct, but the program continues to process the remaining commands without checking the validity of the text.

For instance, after the command `R`, the text becomes `(a` which is not a correct text. The program should immediately output `-1` and stop further processing, but it does not do so.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to check the correctness of the text after each command and provide the correct output for every potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
