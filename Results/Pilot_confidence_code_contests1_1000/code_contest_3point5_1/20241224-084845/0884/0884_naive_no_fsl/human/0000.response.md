Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the number of subarrays where the minimum and maximum elements are the same, but it does not correctly handle the condition that the subarray must be magical (i.e., the minimum and maximum of the subarray must be identical throughout the subarray).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 1 1 4
```

The output of the program is `5`, which includes the subarray `[2, 1, 1, 4]`. However, this subarray is not magical because the minimum and maximum values change within the subarray (minimum is `1` and maximum is `4`).

The correct solution should count only those subarrays where the minimum and maximum values are the same for the entire subarray. The program needs to check each subarray to ensure that the minimum and maximum values are identical.
