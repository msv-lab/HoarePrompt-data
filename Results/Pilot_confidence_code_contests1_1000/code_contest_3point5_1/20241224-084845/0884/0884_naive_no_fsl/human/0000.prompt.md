You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is very interested in magic. Magic attracts him so much that he sees it everywhere. He explains any strange and weird phenomenon through intervention of supernatural forces. But who would have thought that even in a regular array of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical.

Valera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of numbers was written. He immediately thought that the numbers in this array were not random. As a result of extensive research Valera worked out a wonderful property that a magical array should have: an array is defined as magic if its minimum and maximum coincide.

He decided to share this outstanding discovery with you, but he asks you for help in return. Despite the tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete his work. All you have to do is count the number of magical subarrays of the original array of numbers, written on the parchment. Subarray is defined as non-empty sequence of consecutive elements.

Input

The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains an array of original integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109). 

Output

Print on the single line the answer to the problem: the amount of subarrays, which are magical.

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in C++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams (you can also use the %I64d specificator).

Output

8

Note

Notes to sample tests:

Magical subarrays are shown with pairs of indices [a;b] of the beginning and the end.

In the first sample: [1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [2;3].

In the second sample: [1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [5;5], [1;2], [2;3], [1;3]. 
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
n = int(input.readline())
As = input.readline().split(' ')
A = [int(s) for s in As]
assert len(A) > 0 and len(A) == n
N = func_1(A)
output.write('%s' % str(N))

def func_1(A):
    N = 0
    m = 1
    prev = A[0]
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        a = A[i]
        if a == prev:
            m += 1
        else:
            N += (m + 1) * m / 2
            prev = a
            m = 1
    N += (m + 1) * m / 2
    return N


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
