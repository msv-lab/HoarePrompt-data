Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in handling the 'R' case. Specifically, when the character is at the last position in the `l1` list, the program tries to access `l1[i - 1]`, which would cause an `IndexError`. Additionally, the current implementation does not handle the 'L' case correctly for the first character in the input string. 

For example, consider the input:
```
R
p;lkjhgfd;wert
```

The output should be:
```
oiuytrewqoiuy
```

However, the current implementation will fail because it incorrectly shifts the first character without proper boundary checks. To fix this, the program needs to handle edge cases properly, especially for the first character in the 'L' case and the last character in the 'R' case.
