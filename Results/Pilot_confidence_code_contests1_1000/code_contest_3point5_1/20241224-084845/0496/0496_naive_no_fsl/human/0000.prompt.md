You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Our good friend Mole is trying to code a big message. He is typing on an unusual keyboard with characters arranged in following way:
    
    
      
    qwertyuiop  
    asdfghjkl;  
    zxcvbnm,./  
    

Unfortunately Mole is blind, so sometimes it is problem for him to put his hands accurately. He accidentally moved both his hands with one position to the left or to the right. That means that now he presses not a button he wants, but one neighboring button (left or right, as specified in input).

We have a sequence of characters he has typed and we want to find the original message.

Input

First line of the input contains one letter describing direction of shifting ('L' or 'R' respectively for left or right).

Second line contains a sequence of characters written by Mole. The size of this sequence will be no more than 100. Sequence contains only symbols that appear on Mole's keyboard. It doesn't contain spaces as there is no space on Mole's keyboard.

It is guaranteed that even though Mole hands are moved, he is still pressing buttons on keyboard and not hitting outside it.

Output

Print a line that contains the original message.

Examples

Input

R

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    l1 = ['q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'y', 'u', 'i', 'o', 'p', 'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', ';', 'z', 'x', 'c', 'v', 'b', 'n', 'm', ',', '.', '/']
    char = raw_input()
    word = raw_input()
    l = list(word)
    j = 0
    if char == 'R':
        for j in range(0, len(word)):
            for i in range(0, len(l1)):
                if l1[i] == word[j]:
                    sys.stdout.write(l1[i - 1])
    if char == 'L':
        for i in range(0, len(l1)):
            if l1[i] == word[j]:
                sys.stdout.write(l1[i + 1])
                j = j + 1
    print


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
