Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle grids where there are no black cells, which is a valid case according to the problem description.

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
..#
###
##.
```

In this case, there are no black cells. According to the problem description, placing a south magnet in each cell and no north magnets would be a correct solution. However, the program will output `-1` because it checks for the presence of black cells and fails to account for the scenario where no black cells exist.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where there are no black cells separately. Hereâ€™s a modified version of the `func_1` function to address this issue:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    dsu = DisjointSetUnion(n * m)
    f_col = [-1] * n
    f_row = [-1] * m
    cols = set(range(n))
    rows = set(range(m))
    exists = True
    black = False
    white = 0
    prev_row = '.' * m
    for i in range(n):
        row = input()
        for j in range(m):
            if row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#':
                dsu.union(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)
            if j and row[j] == row[j - 1] == '#':
                dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)
            if row[j] == '#':
                black = True
                f_col[i] = f_col[i] if f_col[i] != -1 else j
                f_row[j] = f_row[j] if f_row[j] != -1 else i
                exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2
                exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2
                f_col[i] = j
                f_row[j] = i
                cols.discard(i)
                rows.discard(j)
            else:
                white += 1
        prev_row = row
    
    # Check if there are no black cells
    if white == n * m:
        func_2(0)
    elif (not cols and (not rows) or not black) and exists:
        func_2(len(dsu) - white)
    else:
        func_2(-1)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles the case where there are no black cells, thereby making the program correct according to the problem description.
