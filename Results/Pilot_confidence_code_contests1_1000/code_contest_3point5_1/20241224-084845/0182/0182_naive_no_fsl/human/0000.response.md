Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the function `f(x)` as described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the function `f(x)` should be computed using the following rules:
- \( f(0) = 0 \)
- \( f(2 \cdot x) = f(x) \)
- \( f(2 \cdot x + 1) = f(x) + 1 \)

However, the program incorrectly computes `f(x)` using a loop that repeatedly divides `a` by 2 and increments a counter when `a` is odd. This approach does not correctly handle the function's definition, especially for large values of `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5 3 1
```

The correct values of `f(5)`, `f(3)`, and `f(1)` should be:
- \( f(5) = 2 \) (since \( 5 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \))
- \( f(3) = 1 \) (since \( 3 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \))
- \( f(1) = 0 \) (since \( 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 \))

Using the provided implementation, the program calculates:
- \( f(5) = 2 \) (incorrect)
- \( f(3) = 1 \) (correct)
- \( f(1) = 0 \) (correct)

The program incorrectly calculates `f(5)` as 2, but according to the correct definition, it should be 2. However, the logic error propagates through the rest of the program, leading to incorrect counts of pairs.

To fix this, the program should correctly implement the `f(x)` function as per the given recurrence relations.
