Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive slashes are present at the beginning or end of the input path. According to the problem description, these should be reduced to a single slash unless they represent the root directory. 

For example, the input `///usr///local//nginx///sbin` should be normalized to `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`, but the current implementation will output `//usr/local/nginx///sbin` because it does not properly remove extra leading and trailing slashes except for the root directory case.
