Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to find the first maximum of an unimodal function, but this is not relevant to solving the given problem. The core issue lies in how the function `cond` is used within `func_1`.

The problem requires finding an integer point \( x \) on the OX axis such that the \((k+1)\)-th smallest distance from \( x \) to the given points is minimized. However, the program attempts to use a ternary search (which is designed for finding maxima or minima of unimodal functions) instead of directly addressing the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, one should:
1. Iterate over possible values of \( x \).
2. For each \( x \), compute the distances \( |a_i - x| \).
3. Sort these distances and select the \((k+1)\)-th smallest distance.
4. Track the minimum such distance and the corresponding \( x \).

Since the provided code does not address these steps, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
