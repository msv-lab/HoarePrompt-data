Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the number of inhabited apartments (`k`) is equal to the total number of apartments (`n`). In such a case, no apartment will be good for Maxim since none of the apartments will have an adjacent inhabited apartment.

For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `0 0` because there are no apartments that are good for Maxim. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

Here is an example input that the program does not handle correctly:

Input:
```
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
0 0
```

Actual Output (from the given code):
```
1 0
```

This indicates that the program is incorrect for at least one potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
