You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Maxim wants to buy an apartment in a new house at Line Avenue of Metropolis. The house has n apartments that are numbered from 1 to n and are arranged in a row. Two apartments are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Some of the apartments can already be inhabited, others are available for sale.

Maxim often visits his neighbors, so apartment is good for him if it is available for sale and there is at least one already inhabited apartment adjacent to it. Maxim knows that there are exactly k already inhabited apartments, but he doesn't know their indices yet.

Find out what could be the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments that are good for Maxim.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers: n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 0 ≤ k ≤ n).

Output

Print the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments good for Maxim.

Example

Input

6 3


Output

1 3

Note

In the sample test, the number of good apartments could be minimum possible if, for example, apartments with indices 1, 2 and 3 were inhabited. In this case only apartment 4 is good. The maximum possible number could be, for example, if apartments with indices 1, 3 and 5 were inhabited. In this case all other apartments: 2, 4 and 6 are good.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
