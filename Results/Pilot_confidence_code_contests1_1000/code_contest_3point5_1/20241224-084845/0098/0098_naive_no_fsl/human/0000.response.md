Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is odd, as specified in the problem description. The formula used in `func_1` is derived for even `n`, but the problem states that `n` is always odd. This mismatch leads to incorrect results for odd values of `n`.

For example, consider `n = 3` (a pentagon), the expected minimum side length of the square is approximately `1.931851653`, but the program's output using the given formula is not accurate. The correct formula for the minimum side length of the square for an odd `n` should take into account the geometry of the polygon differently than the provided formula, which is only valid for even `n`.
