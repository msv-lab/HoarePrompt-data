Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where distributing the eggs cannot satisfy the condition \(|Sa - Sg| \leq 500\). Specifically, the program always tries to construct a solution without checking if such a solution is possible. This can lead to incorrect outputs for inputs where no valid distribution exists.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
450 550
550 450
450 550
```

In this case, if we distribute the eggs as `AGA`, the total payment to A would be \(450 + 550 = 1000\) and to G would be \(550 + 450 = 1000\). The difference is \(|1000 - 1000| = 0\), which satisfies the condition. However, another valid distribution could be `GAG`, where the total payment to A would be \(550 + 550 = 1100\) and to G would be \(450 + 450 = 900\). The difference is \(|1100 - 900| = 200\), which also satisfies the condition.

But if we try to distribute the eggs as `AAA`, the total payment to A would be \(450 + 450 + 450 = 1350\) and to G would be \(550 + 550 + 550 = 1650\). The difference is \(|1350 - 1650| = 300\), which still satisfies the condition. However, if we try to distribute the eggs as `GGG`, the total payment to A would be \(450 + 450 + 450 = 1350\) and to G would be \(550 + 550 + 550 = 1650\). The difference is \(|1350 - 1650| = 300\), which also satisfies the condition.

The issue arises when we try to construct a solution for an input like:

```
3
501 499
499 501
501 499
```

No matter how we distribute the eggs, the total payments to A and G will always be \(501 + 499 = 1000\) and \(501 + 499 = 1000\), respectively. Any distribution will result in a difference of \(|1000 - 1000| = 0\), which is within the limit, but the program does not handle the scenario where it's impossible to distribute the eggs in a way that satisfies the condition.

Since the program does not check for the possibility of an invalid distribution, it may produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
