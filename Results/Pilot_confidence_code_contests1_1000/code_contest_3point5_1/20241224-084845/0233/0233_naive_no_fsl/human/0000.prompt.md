You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Bitlandians are quite weird people. They have very peculiar customs.

As is customary, Uncle J. wants to have n eggs painted for Bitruz (an ancient Bitland festival). He has asked G. and A. to do the work.

The kids are excited because just as is customary, they're going to be paid for the job! 

Overall uncle J. has got n eggs. G. named his price for painting each egg. Similarly, A. named his price for painting each egg. It turns out that for each egg the sum of the money both A. and G. want for the painting equals 1000.

Uncle J. wants to distribute the eggs between the children so as to give each egg to exactly one child. Also, Uncle J. wants the total money paid to A. to be different from the total money paid to G. by no more than 500.

Help Uncle J. Find the required distribution of eggs or otherwise say that distributing the eggs in the required manner is impossible.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of eggs.

Next n lines contain two integers ai and gi each (0 ≤ ai, gi ≤ 1000; ai + gi = 1000): ai is the price said by A. for the i-th egg and gi is the price said by G. for the i-th egg.

Output

If it is impossible to assign the painting, print "-1" (without quotes).

Otherwise print a string, consisting of n letters "G" and "A". The i-th letter of this string should represent the child who will get the i-th egg in the required distribution. Letter "A" represents A. and letter "G" represents G. If we denote the money Uncle J. must pay A. for the painting as Sa, and the money Uncle J. must pay G. for the painting as Sg, then this inequality must hold: |Sa - Sg| ≤ 500. 

If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
