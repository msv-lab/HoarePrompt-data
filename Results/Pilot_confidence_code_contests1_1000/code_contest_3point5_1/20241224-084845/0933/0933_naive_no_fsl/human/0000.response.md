Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the closest integer to X that is not in the sequence `p` is negative. For example, if `X = 6` and `N = 5`, and the sequence is `p = [4, 7, 10, 6, 5]`, the program correctly outputs `8`. However, if `X = 1` and `N = 5`, and the sequence is `p = [4, 7, 10, 6, 5]`, the closest integer to `X` that is not in the sequence should be `-1`, but the program will output `4` because it only considers positive integers in the range `[p_min, p_max]`.

To fix this, the program should consider negative integers as well. One way to do this is to adjust the range to include negative numbers and handle them appropriately. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
INF = 10 ** 20

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (X, N) = map(int, input().split())
    p = set(map(int, input().split()))

    # Find the closest integer to X that is not in the sequence p
    closest = INF
    for i in range(-100, 101):  # Consider all possible integers in the range [-100, 100]
        if i not in p:
            if abs(i - X) < abs(closest - X) or (abs(i - X) == abs(closest - X) and i < closest):
                closest = i

    print(closest)
```

This revised program ensures that all possible integers within the range are considered, including negative ones, thus meeting the problem description requirements.
