Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. **Single Element Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints "YES" because the array already consists of a single element.
4. **Sorting and Checking**: For arrays with more than one element, it sorts the array and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds any such pair, it prints "NO" immediately because it means the array cannot be reduced to a single element following the given rules.
5. **Final Output**: If no such pair is found, it prints "YES".

### Testing Cases:
- **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 2]`
  - After sorting, `a = [1, 2, 2]`. Since the difference between consecutive elements is no more than 1, it prints "YES".
- **Case 2**: `n = 4`, `a = [5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - After sorting, `a = [5, 5, 5, 5]`. Since all elements are the same, it prints "YES".
- **Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 4]`
  - After sorting, `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Since the difference between `2` and `4` is 2, it prints "NO".
- **Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 3, 4, 4]`
  - After sorting, `a = [1, 3, 4, 4]`. Since the difference between `3` and `4` is 1, but `4` and `4` are equal, it prints "NO".
- **Case 5**: `n = 1`, `a = [100]`
  - Since `n` is 1, it directly prints "YES".

Given that the program correctly handles all the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, it is correct according to the problem description.
