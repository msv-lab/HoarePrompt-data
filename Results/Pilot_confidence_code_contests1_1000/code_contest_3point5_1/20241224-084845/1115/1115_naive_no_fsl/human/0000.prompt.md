You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given the array a consisting of n positive (greater than zero) integers.

In one move, you can choose two indices i and j (i ≠ j) such that the absolute difference between a_i and a_j is no more than one (|a_i - a_j| ≤ 1) and remove the smallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any of them (but exactly one).

Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of a. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

For each test case, print the answer: "YES" if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) moves described in the problem statement, or "NO" otherwise.

Example

Input


5
3
1 2 2
4
5 5 5 5
3
1 2 4
4
1 3 4 4
1
100


Output


YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case of the example, we can perform the following sequence of moves:

  * choose i=1 and j=3 and remove a_i (so a becomes [2; 2]); 
  * choose i=1 and j=2 and remove a_j (so a becomes [2]). 



In the second test case of the example, we can choose any possible i and j any move and it doesn't matter which element we remove.

In the third test case of the example, there is no way to get rid of 2 and 4.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
