Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program generates a set of points where the x-coordinate ranges from 0 to `min(x, y)` (inclusive), and the y-coordinate is the same for each point. This approach fails to consider the condition that the distance between any two points must be non-integer.

For example, consider the input `2 2`. The program's output would be:
```
3
0 0
0 0
0 0
```
This output is incorrect because the distance between any two points (0, 0) is 0, which is an integer, violating the condition for a beautiful set of points.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that the distance between any two points is non-integer. A valid approach would involve alternating between points with even and odd sums of coordinates, ensuring that the distance between any two points remains non-integer.
