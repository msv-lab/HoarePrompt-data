You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of n⋅ m identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below.

<image>

The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:

  1. The pieces are arranged into a grid with n rows and m columns. 
  2. For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece. 



Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

Input

The test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n,m ≤ 10^5).

Output

For each test case output a single line containing "YES" if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


3
1 3
100000 100000
2 2


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

For the first test case, this is an example solution: 

<image>

For the second test case, we can show that no solution exists.

For the third test case, this is an example solution:

<image>
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
range = xrange
for t in range(input()):
    if min(func_2()) > 2:
        pr('NO\n')
    else:
        pr('YES\n')

def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())

def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
