Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle. Instead, it reads input but does not use the values of `n` and `m` to check the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2()` returns a list of two integers, but these values are not used to verify if the puzzle can be solved based on the given conditions.

To solve this problem, the program needs to check if `n` and `m` are both greater than 1 (since a valid puzzle must have at least one row and one column of pieces). This is because with only one row or one column, it's impossible to form the necessary connections between tabs and blanks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n > 1 and m > 1:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This corrected program will correctly output "YES" for cases where both `n` and `m` are greater than 1, and "NO" otherwise, adhering to the problem description.
