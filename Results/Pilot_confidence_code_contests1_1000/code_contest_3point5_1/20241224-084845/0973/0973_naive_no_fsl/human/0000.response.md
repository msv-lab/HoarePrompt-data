Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the target number \( b \) ends with a series of 1s. Let's consider an example:

### Example
Input:
```
10 1011
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
3
10 20 1011
```

### Actual Output:
The program will incorrectly terminate without considering the possibility of appending 1s to the number. This is because the current logic checks if `big` is even to decide whether to divide by 2 or subtract 1 and then divide by 10. However, it does not properly handle the case where `big` is exactly one more than a multiple of 10, which is necessary to append 1s.

### Why it is Incorrect:
- The program checks if `big % 2 == 0` to decide whether to divide by 2. If not, it tries to see if `temp * 10 + 1 == big`. This condition is insufficient because it does not cover all cases where appending 1s might be necessary.
- For the input `10 1011`, the program will fail to recognize that we need to append 1s multiple times to reach 1011 from 10.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where the target number \( b \) can be reduced by repeatedly dividing by 10 and checking if the result can be reached by appending 1s. A more comprehensive approach is needed to ensure all possible sequences of operations are explored.
