You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the k TV shows. You know the schedule for the next n days: a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show, the episode of which will be shown in i-th day.

The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.

How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of d consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test case descriptions follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show that is broadcasted on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 100.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the test cases in the input in the order they follow. The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for d consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than d days in a row.

Example

Input


4
5 2 2
1 2 1 2 1
9 3 3
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
4 10 4
10 8 6 4
16 9 8
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3


Output


2
1
4
5

Note

In the first test case to have an opportunity to watch shows for two consecutive days, you need to buy a subscription on show 1 and on show 2. So the answer is two.

In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.

In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.

In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows 3,5,7,8,9, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    
        def solve(arr, n, k, d):
            if n == d:
                return len(set(arr))
            m = float('inf')
            freq = Counter(arr[:d])
            for i in range(1, n - d + 1):
                freq[arr[i - 1]] -= 1
                if freq[arr[i - 1]] == 0:
                    del freq[arr[i - 1]]
                if arr[i + d - 1] in freq:
                    freq[arr[i + d - 1]] += 1
                else:
                    freq[arr[i + d - 1]] = 1
                m = min(m, len(freq))
            return m
        print(solve(arr, n, k, d))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
