Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires finding the number of tuples (A, B, C) of positive integers such that \(A \times B + C = N\). However, the current implementation of the program does not iterate over all possible values of A and B, and it incorrectly uses a function `func_1` which is not defined in the problem description.

The program attempts to iterate over a range from 1 to N-1 but then calls `func_1` with `N - i`, which is not relevant to solving the problem. The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of a number, which is not necessary for this problem.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
N = int(input())
count = 0
for A in range(1, N):
    for B in range(1, N):
        C = N - A * B
        if C > 0:
            count += 1
print(count)
```

This corrected program iterates over all possible values of A and B and calculates C accordingly, ensuring that all valid tuples (A, B, C) are counted.
