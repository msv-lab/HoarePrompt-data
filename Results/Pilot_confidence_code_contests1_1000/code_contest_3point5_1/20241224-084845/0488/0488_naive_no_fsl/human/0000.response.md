Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the erasure of characters when the direction pointer changes. Specifically, when the direction changes and the new character that CP is pointing to is "<" or ">", the previous character should be erased from the sequence. However, the current implementation only checks if the new character is "<" or ">" and erases the previous character, but it does not account for the case where the new character is also "<" or ">".

For example, consider the sequence "1>3>22<". For the query (1, 3), the expected output is `0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`, but the program would incorrectly output `0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` because it does not erase the '2' after changing direction from right to left.

To fix this, you need to add a check to erase the previous character when the direction changes and the new character is "<" or ">". Here is a corrected version of the problematic part:

```python
elif st[pnt] == '>':
    dir = 1
    if pnt < len(st) - 1 and dir > 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<'):
        st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
        # Check if the new character is "<" or ">"
        if st[pnt] == '<' or st[pnt] == '>':
            st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
    pnt += dir

elif st[pnt] == '<':
    dir = -1
    if pnt > 0 and dir < 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<'):
        st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
        # Check if the new character is "<" or ">"
        if st[pnt] == '<' or st[pnt] == '>':
            st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
    pnt += dir
```

This ensures that the previous character is erased if the new character is "<" or ">".
