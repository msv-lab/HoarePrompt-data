You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a programming language in which every program is a non-empty sequence of "<" and ">" signs and digits. Let's explain how the interpreter of this programming language works. A program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of two parts.

  * Current character pointer (CP); 
  * Direction pointer (DP) which can point left or right; 



Initially CP points to the leftmost character of the sequence and DP points to the right.

We repeat the following steps until the first moment that CP points to somewhere outside the sequence.

  * If CP is pointing to a digit the interpreter prints that digit then CP moves one step according to the direction of DP. After that the value of the printed digit in the sequence decreases by one. If the printed digit was 0 then it cannot be decreased therefore it's erased from the sequence and the length of the sequence decreases by one. 
  * If CP is pointing to "<" or ">" then the direction of DP changes to "left" or "right" correspondingly. Then CP moves one step according to DP. If the new character that CP is pointing to is "<" or ">" then the previous character will be erased from the sequence. 



If at any moment the CP goes outside of the sequence the execution is terminated.

It's obvious the every program in this language terminates after some steps.

We have a sequence s1, s2, ..., sn of "<", ">" and digits. You should answer q queries. Each query gives you l and r and asks how many of each digit will be printed if we run the sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr as an independent program in this language.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105) — represents the length of the sequence s and the number of queries. 

The second line contains s, a sequence of "<", ">" and digits (0..9) written from left to right. Note, that the characters of s are not separated with spaces. 

The next q lines each contains two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n) — the i-th query.

Output

For each query print 10 space separated integers: x0, x1, ..., x9 where xi equals the number of times the interpreter prints i while running the corresponding program. Print answers to the queries in the order they are given in input.

        st = s[begin - 1:end]
        arr = [0 for j in range(10)]
        pnt = 0
        dir = 1
        while pnt >= 0 and pnt < len(st):
            if st[pnt].isdigit():
                arr[int(st[pnt])] += 1
                if int(st[pnt]) - 1 >= 0:
                    st = st[:pnt] + str(int(st[pnt]) - 1) + st[pnt + 1:]
                    pnt += dir
                else:
                    st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
                    if dir < 0:
                        pnt += dir
            elif st[pnt] == '>':
                dir = 1
                if pnt < len(st) - 1 and dir > 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<') or (pnt > 0 and dir < 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<')):
                    st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
                pnt += dir
            elif st[pnt] == '<':
                dir = -1
                if pnt < len(st) - 1 and dir > 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<') or (pnt > 0 and dir < 0 and (st[pnt + dir] == '>' or st[pnt + dir] == '<')):
                    st = st[:pnt] + st[pnt + 1:]
                pnt += dir
        ss = ' '.join(str(arr).split(','))[1:-1]
        print(ss)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
