Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses a loop with a fixed upper limit `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11` to find the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee finding the solution in all cases.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
1 1
1 2
```

According to the problem description, Rick's scream times are `1, 2, 3, 4, ...` and Morty's scream times are `2, 3, 4, 5, ...`. The first common time they will scream is `2`, which should be the output. However, the program will not find this case because it does not guarantee that it will iterate long enough to find the correct answer.

To fix this, the program needs to use a more robust method to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `c`, and then check if `b + k*a` equals `d + m*c` for some integers `k` and `m`. The correct approach would involve using the LCM formula or a more thorough iteration until the first common time is found.
