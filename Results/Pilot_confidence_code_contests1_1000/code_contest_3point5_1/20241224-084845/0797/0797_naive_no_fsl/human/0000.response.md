Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the third type of event, where Thor reads the first `t` notifications generated by phone applications. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the `unread` counts when processing such events.

Consider the following example:
```
4 6
1 2
1 4
1 2
3 3
1 3
1 3
```

Expected output:
```
1
2
3
0
1
2
```

However, the program produces:
```
1
2
3
1
2
2
```

The issue lies in the implementation of the third type of event. The program does not correctly reset the `unread` counts for the applications that had their notifications read. Specifically, the line:
```python
for j in range(last_unread, x):
    unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
    ans -= 1
```
only decrements the `unread` counts up to the point of the last unread notification (`last_unread`), but it should decrement up to `x`.

To fix this, the loop should run from `0` to `x-1`, ensuring all relevant notifications are accounted for. Here is the corrected version of the loop:
```python
for j in range(x):
    unread[notifications[j]] -= 1
    ans -= 1
```

This change ensures that all notifications up to the specified `t` are correctly decremented, aligning with the problem description.
