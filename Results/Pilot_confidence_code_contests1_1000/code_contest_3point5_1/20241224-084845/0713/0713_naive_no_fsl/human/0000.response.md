Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incomplete Handling of Weight Rules**: The program does not ensure that no two consecutive weights are the same. This rule is a critical part of the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Ensuring Scale Balance**: The `func_1` function does not properly ensure that the left scalepan outweighs the right scalepan after placing each weight. It attempts to balance the scales but fails to consider the rule about not placing two consecutive weights of the same type.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to place `m` weights following the rules. For example, if there are no available weights of a certain type needed to balance the scales, the program should output "NO".

4. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program may enter an infinite loop if it cannot find a valid sequence to place the weights, as it does not have a mechanism to backtrack and try alternative sequences.

To illustrate an incorrect case, consider the input:
```
1000000000
2
```
Here, Xenia only has weights of 1 kg available. According to the rules, she cannot place two 1 kg weights consecutively and needs to keep one side always heavier. However, the program does not account for these constraints properly and will incorrectly output "YES" with "1 1" as a solution, which violates the rules.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case and thus the answer is **False**.
