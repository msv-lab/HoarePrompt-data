Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to pour tea into the cups such that every cup gets at least half of its volume and all the tea is used. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 10
9 8 10
```

According to the problem description, it is impossible to distribute the tea such that every cup gets at least half of its volume (4.5, 4, and 5 milliliters respectively) and still use all 10 milliliters of tea. However, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct for this case. 

However, the program has another issue. When distributing the tea, it does not ensure that no cup ends up with less tea than another cup with a larger volume. Consider the following input:

```
3 15
10 15 20
```

The correct distribution would be to pour 8 milliliters into the first cup, 8 milliliters into the second cup, and 9 milliliters into the third cup. However, the program's approach might not guarantee this result. For instance, it might distribute the tea in a way that violates the satisfaction condition. 

To illustrate, the program might output:

```
8 8 9
```

But this distribution is valid because each cup gets at least half of its volume, all tea is used, and the third cup (with 20 ml volume) gets more than the other two cups. However, the program's logic does not inherently ensure that this condition is always met for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it may fail to meet the satisfaction condition in some cases.
