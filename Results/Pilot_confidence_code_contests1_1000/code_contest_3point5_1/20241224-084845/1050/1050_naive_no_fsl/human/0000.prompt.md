You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp invited all his friends to the tea party to celebrate the holiday. He has n cups, one for each of his n friends, with volumes a1, a2, ..., an. His teapot stores w milliliters of tea (w ≤ a1 + a2 + ... + an). Polycarp wants to pour tea in cups in such a way that:

  * Every cup will contain tea for at least half of its volume 
  * Every cup will contain integer number of milliliters of tea 
  * All the tea from the teapot will be poured into cups 
  * All friends will be satisfied. 



Friend with cup i won't be satisfied, if there exists such cup j that cup i contains less tea than cup j but ai > aj.

For each cup output how many milliliters of tea should be poured in it. If it's impossible to pour all the tea and satisfy all conditions then output -1.

Input

The first line contains two integer numbers n and w (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, <image>).

The second line contains n numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).

Output

Output how many milliliters of tea every cup should contain. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

If it's impossible to pour all the tea and satisfy all conditions then output -1.

Examples

Input

2 10
8 7


Output

6 4 


Input

4 4
1 1 1 1


Output

1 1 1 1 


Input

3 10
9 8 10


Output

-1

Note

In the third example you should pour to the first cup at least 5 milliliters, to the second one at least 4, to the third one at least 5. It sums up to 14, which is greater than 10 milliliters available.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    stringAW = raw_input()
    (n, w) = stringAW.split()
    n = int(n)
    w = int(w)
    stringA = raw_input()
    a = list(stringA.split())
    a = map(int, a)
    tlist = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        tlist[i] = [0, a[i], i]
    tlist.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1])
    for i in range(n):
        tlist[i][0] += math.ceil(tlist[i][1] / 2)
        w -= math.ceil(tlist[i][1] / 2)
    if w < 0:
        print(-1)
        sys.exit()
    inch = 0
    while w > 0 and inch < n:
        if w >= tlist[inch][1] - tlist[inch][0]:
            w -= tlist[inch][1] - tlist[inch][0]
            tlist[inch][0] += tlist[inch][1]
        else:
            tlist[inch][0] += w
            w = 0
        inch += 1
    tlist.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[2], reverse=True)
    if inch == n:
        print(-1)
        sys.exit()
    for i in range(n - 1):
        sys.stdout.write('' + str(int(tlist[i][0])) + ' ')
    sys.stdout.write(str(int(tlist[n - 1][0])))
    sys.stdout.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
