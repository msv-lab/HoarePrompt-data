Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Graph Representation**: The graph `g` represents the railways, but the graph `g1` is supposed to represent the roads. However, the roads are defined as the edges not present in `g`, which means `g1` should be constructed by adding edges that are not in `g`. The current implementation of `g1.addEdge(i, j)` simply adds edges without checking if they are not in `g`.

2. **BFS Utilization**: The BFS utility function `bfs_util` is designed to find the shortest path from node `i` to node `n`. However, the implementation uses a breadth-first search to find any path, which is not necessary since we are looking for the minimum time for each vehicle to reach the destination.

3. **Result Handling**: The code prints `-1` if either BFS does not find a path, but it should handle the case where one of the vehicles cannot reach town `n` separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    railways = set()
    for _ in range(m):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        railways.add((min(u, v), max(u, v)))
    
    # Create adjacency lists for railways and roads
    railways_adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    roads_adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for u, v in railways:
        railways_adj[u].append(v)
        railways_adj[v].append(u)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if (i, j) not in railways:
                roads_adj[i].append(j)
                roads_adj[j].append(i)
    
    # BFS for railways
    rail_queue = deque([(1, 0)])
    rail_vis = [False] * (n + 1)
    rail_vis[1] = True
    rail_time = [-1] * (n + 1)
    rail_time[1] = 0
    
    while rail_queue:
        node, time = rail_queue.popleft()
        if node == n:
            rail_time[n] = time
            break
        for neighbor in railways_adj[node]:
            if not rail_vis[neighbor]:
                rail_queue.append((neighbor, time + 1))
                rail_vis[neighbor] = True
    
    # BFS for roads
    road_queue = deque([(1, 0)])
    road_vis = [False] * (n + 1)
    road_vis[1] = True
    road_time = [-1] * (n + 1)
    road_time[1] = 0
    
    while road_queue:
        node, time = road_queue.popleft()
        if node == n:
            road_time[n] = time
            break
        for neighbor in roads_adj[node]:
            if not road_vis[neighbor]:
                road_queue.append((neighbor, time + 1))
                road_vis[neighbor] = True
    
    # Determine the result
    if rail_time[n] == -1 or road_time[n] == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(max(rail_time[n], road_time[n]))

func()
```

This corrected version constructs the adjacency lists for both railways and roads, performs BFS for both, and correctly handles the case where one of the vehicles cannot reach town `n`.
