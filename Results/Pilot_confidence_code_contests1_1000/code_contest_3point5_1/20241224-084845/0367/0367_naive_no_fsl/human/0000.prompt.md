You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In Absurdistan, there are n towns (numbered 1 through n) and m bidirectional railways. There is also an absurdly simple road network — for each pair of different towns x and y, there is a bidirectional road between towns x and y if and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour.

A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town n, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town n). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.

You've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety — in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town n) simultaneously.

Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town n (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town n at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 400, 0 ≤ m ≤ n(n - 1) / 2) — the number of towns and the number of railways respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v, denoting a railway between towns u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).

You may assume that there is at most one railway connecting any two towns.

Output

Output one integer — the smallest possible time of the later vehicle's arrival in town n. If it's impossible for at least one of the vehicles to reach town n, output  - 1.

Note

In the first sample, the train can take the route <image> and the bus can take the route <image>. Note that they can arrive at town 4 at the same time.

In the second sample, Absurdistan is ruled by railwaymen. There are no roads, so there's no way for the bus to reach town 4.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
