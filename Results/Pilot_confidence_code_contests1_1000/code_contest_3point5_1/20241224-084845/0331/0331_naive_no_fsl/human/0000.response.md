Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the tasks are given in a chronological order but may still cause issues due to how it processes the tasks and updates the available servers. Specifically, the function `func_1` and `func_2` are intended to sort the queue, but they are never actually called in the main logic. This means the queue is not sorted properly, leading to incorrect assignment of servers to tasks.

Consider the following input:
```
4 3
1 3 2
2 2 1
3 4 3
```

Expected output:
```
6
-1
10
```

However, the current implementation might assign servers incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. Since the queue is not sorted, it may lead to situations where the program incorrectly assigns servers or ignores tasks when there are available servers that could be used.

To fix this, the `func_1` and `func_2` functions should be called appropriately to ensure the queue is sorted before processing each task. This would help in correctly assigning servers to tasks based on their arrival times and availability.
