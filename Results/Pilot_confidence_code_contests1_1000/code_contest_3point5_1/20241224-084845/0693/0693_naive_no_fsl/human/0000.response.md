Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements the Euclidean algorithm correctly to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers `a` and `b`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all cases correctly. The algorithm ensures that the GCD is found regardless of whether `a` is greater than or less than `b`, and it works efficiently within the given constraint range (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

Since no edge cases or inputs violate the problem description, the program is correct.
