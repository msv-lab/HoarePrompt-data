Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains three unused functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) and the main function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. Specifically, the dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with `-1` values, but it should be initialized with `float('inf')` to represent infinity, since the initial value for the cost is `0`. Additionally, the loop should start from index `k` to ensure that the frog has enough stones to jump from.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(k, n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]))
    print(dp[-1])
```

With this correction, the program should now handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
