Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Snuke can buy juice indefinitely based on the given constraints and problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` contains logical errors that prevent it from accurately modeling the stock behavior over time.

For instance, consider the case where `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, and `d = 4`. According to the problem description, Snuke can buy juice indefinitely because `d >= b` and the initial stock `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. However, the program incorrectly returns `False` for this case due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

The issue lies in how the function handles the modulo operation and the condition checks. The function `func_1` should ensure that the stock never falls below `C` cans and that there are always at least `B` cans available when Snuke attempts to buy them. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the stock replenishment process over multiple days.

To fix this, the function should simulate the stock changes over time until it either determines that Snuke can buy juice indefinitely or finds a point where the stock falls below `B` cans. The provided solution does not do this and instead relies on conditions that do not fully capture the dynamics of the stock changes.
