You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ringo Mart, a convenience store, sells apple juice.

On the opening day of Ringo Mart, there were A cans of juice in stock in the morning. Snuke buys B cans of juice here every day in the daytime. Then, the manager checks the number of cans of juice remaining in stock every night. If there are C or less cans, D new cans will be added to the stock by the next morning.

Determine if Snuke can buy juice indefinitely, that is, there is always B or more cans of juice in stock when he attempts to buy them. Nobody besides Snuke buy juice at this store.

Note that each test case in this problem consists of T queries.

Constraints

* 1 \leq T \leq 300
* 1 \leq A, B, C, D \leq 10^{18}
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


T
A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1
A_2 B_2 C_2 D_2
:
A_T B_T C_T D_T


In the i-th query, A = A_i, B = B_i, C = C_i, D = D_i.

Output

Print T lines. The i-th line should contain `Yes` if Snuke can buy apple juice indefinitely in the i-th query; `No` otherwise.

for t in range(input()):
    (a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print['No', 'Yes'][func_1(a, b, c, d)]

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    if a < b or d < b:
        return False
    a -= c
    a %= gcd(b, d)
    if a == 0:
        a = gcd(b, d)
    return a - b >= -c


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
