You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob has a permutation of integers from 1 to n. Denote this permutation as p. The i-th element of p will be denoted as pi. For all pairs of distinct integers i, j between 1 and n, he wrote the number ai, j = min(pi, pj). He writes ai, i = 0 for all integer i from 1 to n.

Bob gave you all the values of ai, j that he wrote down. Your job is to reconstruct any permutation that could have generated these values. The input will be formed so that it is guaranteed that there is at least one solution that is consistent with the information given.

Input

The first line of the input will contain a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The next n lines will contain the values of ai, j. The j-th number on the i-th line will represent ai, j. The i-th number on the i-th line will be 0. It's guaranteed that ai, j = aj, i and there is at least one solution consistent with the information given.

Output

Print n space separated integers, which represents a permutation that could have generated these values. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

2
0 1
1 0


Output

2 1


Input

5
0 2 2 1 2
2 0 4 1 3
2 4 0 1 3
1 1 1 0 1
2 3 3 1 0


Output

2 5 4 1 3

Note

In the first case, the answer can be {1, 2} or {2, 1}.

In the second case, another possible answer is {2, 4, 5, 1, 3}.
Program:
```
def func():
    i = input()
    for j in range(0, i):
        dic = {}
        q = raw_input()
        a = q.split(' ')
        ma = False
        for k in a:
            if int(k) == i - 1:
                print(q.replace(' 0 ', ' ' + str(i) + ' '))
                ma = True
                break
        if ma:
            break


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
