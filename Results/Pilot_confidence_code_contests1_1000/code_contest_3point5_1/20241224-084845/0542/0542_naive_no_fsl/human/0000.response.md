Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to have some logical issues and does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the main logic do not seem to fully address the problem requirements.

Let's analyze a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3`
   - This case works correctly.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `1 2`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5`
   - This case works correctly.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - This case works correctly.

However, let's consider another case:

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `5` (since the height is sufficient to fit 5 balloons vertically, each touching the bottom and the sides)
   - Program Output: Need to verify

Let's manually verify this case:
- For \( r = 2 \) and \( h = 3 \):
  - Each balloon has a diameter of 4 (since the radius is 2).
  - The height of the cupboard is \( h + r = 3 + 2 = 5 \).
  - We can fit 1 balloon vertically on top, and 2 balloons stacked below it (touching the bottom and the sides), making a total of 3 balloons vertically.
  - Additionally, we can fit 2 more balloons horizontally on the bottom row, making a total of 5 balloons.

Given the above analysis, the program should output `5` for the input `2 3`, but the provided program does not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
