Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a function `func_1` which is intended to convert a number from decimal to a specified base `b`. However, this function is not used within the main loop where the multiplication table is generated. Instead, the condition `if base != 10:` checks whether the base is not 10 and then calls `func_1`, but the result is not utilized. This means that the program will generate the multiplication table correctly in base 10 but will fail to handle other bases as required.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be called to convert the product `n` to the desired base `k` before printing it. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

base = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = int(func_1(n, base))
        sys.stdout.write('%s' % func_1(n, base))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

def func_1(num, b, numerals='0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'):
    if num == 0:
        return '0'
    result = ''
    while num > 0:
        result = numerals[num % b] + result
        num //= b
    return result
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for any base `k` between 2 and 10.
