Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the optimal location for the shawarma tent. The logic used to determine the maximum number of students who will visit the tent and the coordinates for the tent are flawed. Specifically:

1. The program calculates `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the number of students whose x-coordinates are less than, greater than, less than, or greater than `X-1` and `Y-1`, respectively. However, this approach does not account for the Manhattan distance requirement, which states that the tent must be on one of the shortest paths from the school to the student's house.

2. The program prints the coordinates `(X-1, Y)` if `a` is the maximum, but this does not necessarily maximize the number of students visiting the tent. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   4 3 2
   1 3
   4 2
   5 1
   4 1
   ```
   The program outputs:
   ```
   3
   2 2
   ```
   However, placing the shawarma tent at `(4, 2)` would result in 3 students visiting it, which is the correct answer.

3. The program does not handle the case where the optimal location could be `(X+1, Y)`, `(X, Y-1)`, or `(X, Y+1)` based on the number of students who would pass through those points.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all possible directions and count the number of students who would pass through each potential tent location.
