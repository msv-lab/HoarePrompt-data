You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The map of the capital of Berland can be viewed on the infinite coordinate plane. Each point with integer coordinates contains a building, and there are streets connecting every building to four neighbouring buildings. All streets are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The main school of the capital is located in (s_x, s_y). There are n students attending this school, the i-th of them lives in the house located in (x_i, y_i). It is possible that some students live in the same house, but no student lives in (s_x, s_y).

After classes end, each student walks from the school to his house along one of the shortest paths. So the distance the i-th student goes from the school to his house is |s_x - x_i| + |s_y - y_i|.

The Provision Department of Berland has decided to open a shawarma tent somewhere in the capital (at some point with integer coordinates). It is considered that the i-th student will buy a shawarma if at least one of the shortest paths from the school to the i-th student's house goes through the point where the shawarma tent is located. It is forbidden to place the shawarma tent at the point where the school is located, but the coordinates of the shawarma tent may coincide with the coordinates of the house of some student (or even multiple students).

You want to find the maximum possible number of students buying shawarma and the optimal location for the tent itself.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s_x, s_y (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ s_x, s_y ≤ 10^{9}) — the number of students and the coordinates of the school, respectively.

Then n lines follow. The i-th of them contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^{9}) — the location of the house where the i-th student lives. Some locations of houses may coincide, but no student lives in the same location where the school is situated.

Output

The output should consist of two lines. The first of them should contain one integer c — the maximum number of students that will buy shawarmas at the tent. 

The second line should contain two integers p_x and p_y — the coordinates where the tent should be located. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Note that each of p_x and p_y should be not less than 0 and not greater than 10^{9}.

Note

In the first example, If we build the shawarma tent in (4, 2), then the students living in (4, 2), (4, 1) and (5, 1) will visit it.

In the second example, it is possible to build the shawarma tent in (1, 1), then both students living in (0, 0) will visit it.
Program:
```
def func():
    input = raw_input
    (N, X, Y) = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(N)]
    a = b = c = d = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x[0] <= X - 1:
            a += 1
        elif x[0] >= X + 1:
            b += 1
        if x[1] <= Y - 1:
            c += 1
        else:
            d += 1
    if X == 0:
        a = 0
    if Y == 0:
        c = 0
    m = max(a, b, c, d)
    print(m)
    if m == a:
        print(X - 1, Y)
    elif m == b:
        print(X + 1, Y)
    elif m == c:
        print(X, Y - 1)
    else:
        print(X, Y + 1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
