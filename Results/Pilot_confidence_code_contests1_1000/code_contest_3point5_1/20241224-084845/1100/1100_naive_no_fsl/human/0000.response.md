Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the median for the list excluding the current element \(X_i\). Specifically, the program constructs a new list by concatenating two sublists `X[:i]` and `X[i + 1:]`, but it does not ensure that this new list has an odd number of elements, which is necessary to calculate the median directly using `sorted()`'s indexing.

Given that \(N\) is even, removing one element will result in a list of length \(N-1\), which is odd. However, the program assumes the list length remains even after removing \(X_i\), leading to incorrect median calculations.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 4 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
4
3
3
4
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because it incorrectly calculates the median for each \(B_i\).

To fix this, the program should directly calculate the median of the modified list without assuming the list length remains even. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    X = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sorted_X = sorted(X)
    mid_index = (N - 1) // 2
    
    for i in range(N):
        # Create the new list without X[i]
        new_list = sorted_X[:i] + sorted_X[i+1:]
        # Calculate the median of the new list
        if len(new_list) % 2 == 1:
            median = new_list[mid_index]
        else:
            median = (new_list[mid_index] + new_list[mid_index + 1]) / 2
        print(median)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the median is calculated correctly for each modified list.
