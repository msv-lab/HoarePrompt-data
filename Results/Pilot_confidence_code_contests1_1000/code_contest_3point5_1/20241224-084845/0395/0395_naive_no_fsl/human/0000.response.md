Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input set contains only a single element. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the `mex` value of a set with a single unique element should be 1, not 2.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1
  0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

The program calculates the `mex` values incorrectly by incrementing `i` too aggressively. For the set `{0}`, the correct `mex` values for both subsets would be 1, leading to a total `mex(A) + mex(B)` of 2. However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles sets with a single unique element by setting the `ans` to 2 initially when such a case is detected.
