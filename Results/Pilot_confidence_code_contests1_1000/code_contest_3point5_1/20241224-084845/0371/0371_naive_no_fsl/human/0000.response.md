Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program counts the number of minutes that are multiples of both `n` and `m` within the range from 1 to `z`. However, the problem requires counting the number of artists that should be killed so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls. This means we need to count the number of minutes that are multiples of `n` but not `m` within the range from 1 to `z`.

The current implementation does not differentiate between minutes that are multiples of both `n` and `m` and those that are only multiples of `n`. Therefore, it will overcount the number of artists that need to be killed.

For example, consider the input `1 2 5`:
- According to the problem, we need to kill artists that come on the 2nd and 4th minutes.
- However, the program will count the 2nd minute as both a multiple of `n` and `m`, resulting in an incorrect count of 2 artists instead of 1.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to count only the minutes that are multiples of `n` but not `m`:
```python
def func():
    count = 0
    st = raw_input()
    num = st.split()
    n = int(num[0])
    m = int(num[1])
    z = int(num[2])
    for i in range(1, z + 1):
        if i % n == 0 and i % m != 0:
            count = count + 1
    print(count)
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly count the number of artists that need to be killed so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls.
