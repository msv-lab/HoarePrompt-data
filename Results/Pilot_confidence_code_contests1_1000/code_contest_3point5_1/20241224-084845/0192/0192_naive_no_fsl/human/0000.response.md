Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the submission times might exceed 119 minutes, which could lead to incorrect scoring since the formula `max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)` assumes `m1` is within the valid range [0, 119]. 

To fix these issues, the program should be updated to:

```python
def func():
    m = input().split(' ')
    w = input().split(' ')
    h = input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = int(m[i])
        w1 = int(w[i])
        if m1 > 119:
            m1 = 119  # Ensure m1 is within the valid range
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans += pts
    ans += 100 * int(h[0])
    ans -= 50 * int(h[1])
    print(int(ans))

```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
