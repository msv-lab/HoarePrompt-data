Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the black cells are already in the shape of a square but are not aligned with the top-left corner of the grid. Specifically, the program fails to consider the smallest possible square that can be formed by expanding from the existing black cells to the edges of the grid.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
BWB
BWB
BWB
```

In this case, the black cells already form a 3x3 square, but the program incorrectly calculates the number of cells to be painted. The program tries to find the maximum distance between the black cells horizontally and vertically and then calculates the area of the largest square that can be formed, which leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to find the smallest square that can be formed by expanding from the existing black cells to the edges of the grid, rather than just considering the maximum distance between the black cells.
