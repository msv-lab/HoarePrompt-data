Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of arranging the luggage in order from the lightest with minimal physical strength. Here's why:

1. **Fenwick Tree Usage**: The program uses a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently compute the minimum physical strength required to move the luggage into a sorted order. This is a valid approach as it allows for efficient updates and queries.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: The dynamic programming part of the solution ensures that the minimum cost to move each piece of luggage to its correct position is calculated. By maintaining a cumulative maximum value (using the `max` function in the Fenwick Tree), the program ensures that the total cost is minimized.

3. **Sorting and Enumerating**: The program sorts the weights along with their original indices, which helps in calculating the cost incrementally. This step ensures that the program considers all possible positions for each piece of luggage.

4. **Correctness Across Examples**: The provided examples are handled correctly by the program. For instance, in the first example, the output is 4, which matches the expected result. Similarly, the second and third examples also yield the correct outputs.

Given these points, the program seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
