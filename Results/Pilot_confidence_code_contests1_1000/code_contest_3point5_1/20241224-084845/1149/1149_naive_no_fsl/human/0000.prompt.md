You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Taro has decided to move. Taro has a lot of luggage, so I decided to ask a moving company to carry the luggage. Since there are various weights of luggage, I asked them to arrange them in order from the lightest one for easy understanding, but the mover left the luggage in a different order. So Taro tried to sort the luggage, but the luggage is heavy and requires physical strength to carry. Each piece of luggage can be carried from where it is now to any place you like, such as between other pieces of luggage or at the edge of the piece of luggage, but carrying one piece of luggage uses as much physical strength as the weight of that piece of luggage. Taro doesn't have much physical strength, so I decided to think of a way to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest one without using as much physical strength as possible.

Constraints

> 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
> 1 ≤ xi ≤ n (1 ≤ i ≤ n)
> xi ≠ xj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j)
>

* All inputs are given as integers

Input

> n
> x1 x2 ... xn
>

* n represents the number of luggage that Taro has
* x1 to xn represent the weight of each piece of luggage, and are currently arranged in the order of x1, x2, ..., xn.

Output

> S
>

* Output the total S of the minimum physical strength required to arrange the luggage in order from the lightest, but output the line break at the end

                n = (n & n + 1) - 1
            return ret
    N = int(input())
    X = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    dp = FenwickTree([0] * N, lambda x, y: max(x, y), 0)
    for (x, i) in sorted(((x, i) for (i, x) in enumerate(X))):
        dp.update(i, dp.query(i) + x)
    print(N * (N + 1) // 2 - dp.query(N - 1))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
