Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the given partial permutation cannot be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation. Specifically, the program does not correctly check if the given elements can be part of a stack-sortable permutation when combined with the remaining elements. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 3
2 3 1
```

In this case, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to extend `[2, 3, 1]` to a stack-sortable permutation of size 5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and instead attempts to generate a permutation, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
