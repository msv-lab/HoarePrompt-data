Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic for constructing the longest strictly increasing sequence by taking elements from either the left or the right end of the given sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the sequence `ar` as a deque, which allows efficient access to both the leftmost and rightmost elements.

2. **Main Loop**: The main loop continues until the deque `ar` is empty. Within the loop, it checks whether taking the leftmost or rightmost element would result in a strictly increasing sequence.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If both the leftmost and rightmost elements are greater than the previous element (`prev`), it checks which one has more potential to extend the sequence.
   - If only one of them is greater, it takes that one.
   - If neither is greater, the loop breaks, indicating no valid extension can be made.

4. **Output**: The length of the resulting sequence is printed first, followed by the sequence of moves ('L' or 'R') that led to this sequence.

5. **Edge Case: All Elements are the Same**: The program handles the case where all elements in the sequence are the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`). In such a case, it correctly outputs the length 1 and a move that removes the rightmost element.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and finds the longest possible sequence. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
