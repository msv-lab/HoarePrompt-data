Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where a vertex's children respect it but the vertex itself does not respect its parent. This is a critical aspect of the problem statement.

Consider the following input:
```
5
3 1
1 1
-1 0
2 0
3 0
```

In this case:
- Vertex 1 does not respect its parent (Vertex 3).
- Vertex 2 respects its parent (Vertex 1).
- Vertex 3 respects its parent (Root).
- Vertex 4 respects its parent (Vertex 1).
- Vertex 5 does not respect its parent (Vertex 3).

According to the problem description, Vertex 1 should be deleted first because it does not respect its parent and none of its children (Vertex 4) respect it. After deleting Vertex 1, Vertex 2 becomes connected to Vertex 3, and since Vertex 2 still does not respect its parent (Vertex 3), it should be deleted next. However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and prints nothing, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the deletion logic for all possible cases, leading to an incorrect verdict.
