You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rooted tree with vertices numerated from 1 to n. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex named root.

Ancestors of the vertex i are all vertices on the path from the root to the vertex i, except the vertex i itself. The parent of the vertex i is the nearest to the vertex i ancestor of i. Each vertex is a child of its parent. In the given tree the parent of the vertex i is the vertex p_i. For the root, the value p_i is -1.

<image> An example of a tree with n=8, the root is vertex 5. The parent of the vertex 2 is vertex 3, the parent of the vertex 1 is vertex 5. The ancestors of the vertex 6 are vertices 4 and 5, the ancestors of the vertex 7 are vertices 8, 3 and 5

You noticed that some vertices do not respect others. In particular, if c_i = 1, then the vertex i does not respect any of its ancestors, and if c_i = 0, it respects all of them.

You decided to delete vertices from the tree one by one. On each step you select such a non-root vertex that it does not respect its parent and none of its children respects it. If there are several such vertices, you select the one with the smallest number. When you delete this vertex v, all children of v become connected with the parent of v.

<image> An example of deletion of the vertex 7.

Once there are no vertices matching the criteria for deletion, you stop the process. Print the order in which you will delete the vertices. Note that this order is unique.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The next n lines describe the tree: the i-th line contains two integers p_i and c_i (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, 0 ≤ c_i ≤ 1), where p_i is the parent of the vertex i, and c_i = 0, if the vertex i respects its parents, and c_i = 1, if the vertex i does not respect any of its parents. The root of the tree has -1 instead of the parent index, also, c_i=0 for the root. It is guaranteed that the values p_i define a rooted tree with n vertices.

Output

In case there is at least one vertex to delete, print the only line containing the indices of the vertices you will delete in the order you delete them. Otherwise print a single integer -1.

Note

The deletion process in the first example is as follows (see the picture below, the vertices with c_i=1 are in yellow):

  * first you will delete the vertex 1, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (the vertex 2) do not respect it, and 1 is the smallest index among such vertices; 
  * the vertex 2 will be connected with the vertex 3 after deletion; 
  * then you will delete the vertex 2, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (the only vertex 4) do not respect it; 
  * the vertex 4 will be connected with the vertex 3; 
  * then you will delete the vertex 4, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (there are none) do not respect it ([vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth)); 
  * you will just delete the vertex 4; 
  * there are no more vertices to delete. 

<image>

In the second example you don't need to delete any vertex:

  * vertices 2 and 3 have children that respect them; 
  * vertices 4 and 5 respect ancestors.

In the third example the tree will change this way:

Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import io
import os
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from __builtin__ import xrange as range
    from cStringIO import StringIO
    from future_builtins import ascii, filter, hex, map, oct, zip
else:
    from io import BytesIO as StringIO
(sys.stdout, stream) = (io.IOBase(), StringIO())
sys.stdout.flush = lambda : os.write(1, stream.getvalue()) and (not stream.truncate(0)) and stream.seek(0)
sys.stdout.write = stream.write if sys.version_info[0] < 3 else lambda s: stream.write(s.encode())
(input, flush) = (sys.stdin.readline, sys.stdout.flush)
input = StringIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    nodes = [[int(i) for i in input().split()] for _ in range(n)]
    a = list(map(lambda x: x[1], nodes))
    for node in nodes:
        if node[0] != -1:
            a[node[0] - 1] &= node[1]
    sol = [node + 1 for (node, _) in filter(lambda x: x[1], zip(range(n), a))]
    print(sol if sol else -1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
