You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Inna loves sleeping very much, so she needs n alarm clocks in total to wake up. Let's suppose that Inna's room is a 100 × 100 square with the lower left corner at point (0, 0) and with the upper right corner at point (100, 100). Then the alarm clocks are points with integer coordinates in this square.

The morning has come. All n alarm clocks in Inna's room are ringing, so Inna wants to turn them off. For that Inna has come up with an amusing game:

  * First Inna chooses a type of segments that she will use throughout the game. The segments can be either vertical or horizontal. 
  * Then Inna makes multiple moves. In a single move, Inna can paint a segment of any length on the plane, she chooses its type at the beginning of the game (either vertical or horizontal), then all alarm clocks that are on this segment switch off. The game ends when all the alarm clocks are switched off. 



Inna is very sleepy, so she wants to get through the alarm clocks as soon as possible. Help her, find the minimum number of moves in the game that she needs to turn off all the alarm clocks!

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the alarm clocks. The next n lines describe the clocks: the i-th line contains two integers xi, yi — the coordinates of the i-th alarm clock (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

Note that a single point in the room can contain any number of alarm clocks and the alarm clocks can lie on the sides of the square that represents the room.

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of segments Inna will have to draw if she acts optimally.

Output

3

Note

In the first sample, Inna first chooses type "vertical segments", and then she makes segments with ends at : (0, 0), (0, 2); and, for example, (1, 0), (1, 1). If she paints horizontal segments, she will need at least 3 segments.

In the third sample it is important to note that Inna doesn't have the right to change the type of the segments during the game. That's why she will need 3 horizontal or 3 vertical segments to end the game.
Program:
```
number_of_clocks = int(raw_input())
clocks_pos = [[] for i in range(number_of_clocks)]
for i in range(number_of_clocks):
    clocks_pos[i] = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split()]
x = func_1(clocks_pos, 0)
y = func_1(clocks_pos, 1)
print(min(x, y))

def func_1(clocks_pos, coord):
    l = [0 for i in range(101)]
    for pos in clocks_pos:
        l[pos[coord]] += 1
    res = 0
    for i in l:
        if i > 0:
            res += 1
    return res


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
