Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a dynamic programming approach with binary search. However, there is a critical issue in the logic. The `dp` array is initialized with `float('inf')`, but the algorithm does not correctly update the `dp` array to reflect the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Specifically, the line `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]` is problematic because it updates the `dp` array to store the actual values of the sequence, rather than the lengths of the increasing subsequences. This leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
5
1
3
2
4
```

The correct output should be `3`, but the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not properly track the lengths of the increasing subsequences.

To fix this, the `dp` array should store the smallest tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    dp = []
    for i in range(n):
        idx = bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])
        if idx == len(dp):
            dp.append(a[i])
        else:
            dp[idx] = a[i]
    print(len(dp))


func()
```

This corrected version initializes an empty list `dp` and uses binary search to find the correct position to either append a new value or replace an existing value in `dp`. This way, `dp` will always contain the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths, ensuring the correct length of the longest increasing subsequence is computed.
