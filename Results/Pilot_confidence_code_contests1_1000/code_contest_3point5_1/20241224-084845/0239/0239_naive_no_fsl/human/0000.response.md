Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program uses a segment tree to keep track of the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from any point. However, there are issues in the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_4`**: The function `func_4` is supposed to binary search for the farthest domino that can be pushed by the current domino. However, the logic inside `func_4` is flawed. It checks if `dom[m][0] < x + h` to decide whether to move the start or end pointer, but this condition is incorrect. The correct condition should be `dom[m][0] <= x + dom[m][1] - 1` to ensure that the domino at index `m` is within the range that can be affected by pushing the current domino.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Segment Tree Updates**: The segment tree update logic in `func_2` seems to be correct, but the overall structure and logic of the program are problematic due to the above-mentioned issues in `func_4`.

To fix the program, the `func_4` function needs to be corrected to properly binary search for the farthest domino that can be pushed. Here is a corrected version of `func_4`:

```python
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = (e + s) // 2
        if dom[m][0] <= x + h - 1:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
    return e
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly determine the number of dominoes that will fall if each domino is pushed to the right. However, the original program's logic and implementation contain significant flaws that prevent it from being correct as stated.
