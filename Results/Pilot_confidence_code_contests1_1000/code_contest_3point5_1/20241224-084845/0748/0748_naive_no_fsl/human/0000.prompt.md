You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s of even length n. String s is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's.

String s has exactly n/2 zeroes and n/2 ones (n is even).

In one operation you can reverse any substring of s. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.

What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string s alternating? A string is alternating if s_i ≠ s_{i + 1} for all i. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; n is even) — the length of string s.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n (s_i ∈ {0, 1}). String s has exactly n/2 zeroes and n/2 ones.

It's guaranteed that the total sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of operations to make s alternating.

Example

Input


3
2
10
4
0110
8
11101000


Output


0
1
2

Note

In the first test case, string 10 is already alternating.

In the second test case, we can, for example, reverse the last two elements of s and get: 0110 → 0101.

In the third test case, we can, for example, make the following two operations: 

  1. 11101000 → 10101100; 
  2. 10101100 → 10101010. 
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
from functools import reduce
from bisect import bisect_right
from bisect import bisect_left
import copy
import atexit, io, sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    sys.stdout = buffer

    @atexit.register
    for _ in xrange(input()):
        n = input()
        l = raw_input()
        l += '+'
        c1 = 0
        c0 = 0
        OI = 0
        IO = 0
        for i in xrange(1, n):
            if l[i] == '1' and l[i - 1] == '1':
                c1 += 1
            if l[i] == '0' and l[i - 1] == '0':
                c0 += 1
            if l[i] == '1' and l[i - 1] == '0' and (l[i + 1] != '0'):
                OI += 1
            if l[i] == '0' and l[i - 1] == '1' and (l[i + 1] != '1'):
                IO += 1
        print(min(OI, IO) + min(c1, c0))

def write():
    sys.__stdout__.write(buffer.getvalue())


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
