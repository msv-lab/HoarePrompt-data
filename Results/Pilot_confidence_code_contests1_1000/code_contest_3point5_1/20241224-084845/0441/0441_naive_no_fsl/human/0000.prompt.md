You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ayoub thinks that he is a very smart person, so he created a function f(s), where s is a binary string (a string which contains only symbols "0" and "1"). The function f(s) is equal to the number of substrings in the string s that contains at least one symbol, that is equal to "1".

More formally, f(s) is equal to the number of pairs of integers (l, r), such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s| (where |s| is equal to the length of string s), such that at least one of the symbols s_l, s_{l+1}, …, s_r is equal to "1". 

For example, if s = "01010" then f(s) = 12, because there are 12 such pairs (l, r): (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5).

Ayoub also thinks that he is smarter than Mahmoud so he gave him two integers n and m and asked him this problem. For all binary strings s of length n which contains exactly m symbols equal to "1", find the maximum value of f(s).

Mahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him? 

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line for each test case contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{9}, 0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the length of the string and the number of symbols equal to "1" in it.

Output

For every test case print one integer number — the maximum value of f(s) over all strings s of length n, which has exactly m symbols, equal to "1".

Example

Input


5
3 1
3 2
3 3
4 0
5 2


Output


4
5
6
0
12

Note

In the first test case, there exists only 3 strings of length 3, which has exactly 1 symbol, equal to "1". These strings are: s_1 = "100", s_2 = "010", s_3 = "001". The values of f for them are: f(s_1) = 3, f(s_2) = 4, f(s_3) = 3, so the maximum value is 4 and the answer is 4.

In the second test case, the string s with the maximum value is "101".

In the third test case, the string s with the maximum value is "111".

In the fourth test case, the only string s of length 4, which has exactly 0 symbols, equal to "1" is "0000" and the value of f for that string is 0, so the answer is 0.

In the fifth test case, the string s with the maximum value is "01010" and it is described as an example in the problem statement.
Program:
```
t = int(raw_input())
for i in xrange(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    md = (n - m) % (m + 1)
    d = (n - m) / (m + 1)
    print(func_1(n) - md * func_1(d + 1) - (m + 1 - md) * func_1(d))

def func_1(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
