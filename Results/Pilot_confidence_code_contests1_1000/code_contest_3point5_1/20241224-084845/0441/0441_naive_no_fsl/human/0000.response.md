Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum value of \( f(s) \) for all test cases. Specifically, it fails for the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 2 \). According to the problem description, the string "01010" should give the maximum value of \( f(s) \), which is 12. However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. 

Let's analyze the issue:

1. The formula used in the program is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \text{func\_1}(n) - \text{md} \times \text{func\_1}(d + 1) - (m + 1 - \text{md}) \times \text{func\_1}(d)
   \]
   where:
   \[
   \text{md} = (n - m) \% (m + 1)
   \]
   \[
   d = \left\lfloor \frac{n - m}{m + 1} \right\rfloor
   \]

2. For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 2 \):
   - \( d = \left\lfloor \frac{5 - 2}{2 + 1} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
   - \( \text{md} = (5 - 2) \% (2 + 1) = 0 \)
   - \(\text{func\_1}(5) = 15\)
   - \(\text{func\_1}(2) = 3\)

   Plugging these into the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = 15 - 0 \times 3 - (2 + 1 - 0) \times 3 = 15 - 9 = 6
   \]

This result is incorrect because the actual maximum value of \( f(s) \) for \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 2 \) is 12. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
