Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tanks from a country is not a beautiful number and is not zero. According to the problem description, if any country's number of tanks is not a beautiful number and is not zero, the product should be zero. However, the program does not check for this condition properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 11 1
```
- The first and third numbers are beautiful (`1` and `1`).
- The second number (`11`) is not beautiful but is not zero either.
- According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because of the non-beautiful number `11`.

However, the current implementation will output `110`, which is incorrect. The program should check if any number is neither zero nor beautiful and return `0` immediately in such cases.
