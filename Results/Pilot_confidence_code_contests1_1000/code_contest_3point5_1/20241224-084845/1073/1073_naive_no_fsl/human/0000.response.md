Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are such that \(A = 1\). In such a case, the formula used in `func_1` and the logic for calculating `mn` might lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem statement, if Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly because it starts with \(r = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\), which for \(n = 4\) gives \(r = 3\). This leads to an incorrect calculation of `mn`.

To fix this, the program should include a special case check for \(A = 1\). Here is a modified version of the code that includes this check:

```python
import sys
import math

n = eval(sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split()[0])
if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit(0)

# Handle the special case where A = 1
if n >= 9:
    mn = max(8 * n + 9, 2 * (n + 3) + 1)
else:
    r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1
    r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1
    mx = 8 * n + 9
    mn = mx
    while r > 0:
        if n % r == 0:
            A = r
            m = n / r
            B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1
            while B > 0:
                if m % B == 0:
                    C = m / B
                    mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])
                B -= 1
        r -= 1

print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))

def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles the special case where \(A = 1\), thereby improving its correctness.
