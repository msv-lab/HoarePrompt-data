Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the fraction is not proper (i.e., the numerator is not less than the denominator). For example, consider the input `12`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `5 7` because \(5 + 7 = 12\) and \(\frac{5}{7}\) is a proper irreducible fraction. However, the program will incorrectly output `6 6` because it iterates through all possible pairs and prints the first pair that is coprime, which is `(6, 6)` in this case. Since \(6 + 6 = 12\) and \(\gcd(6, 6) = 6\), the fraction \(\frac{6}{6}\) is not proper. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of always producing a proper fraction.
