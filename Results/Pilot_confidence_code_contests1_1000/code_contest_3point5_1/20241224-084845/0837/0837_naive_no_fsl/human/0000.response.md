Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the general case correctly for all inputs. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario when `n` is even but greater than 2. Let's consider the case when `n = 6`:

- For `n = 6`, the integers are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- The program attempts to pair elements from the start and end of the list, which results in the pairs `(1, 6)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(3, 4)`.
- The sums would be:
  - Left group: `1 + 6 + 3 = 10`
  - Right group: `2 + 5 + 4 = 11`
- The absolute difference is `|10 - 11| = 1`.

However, the optimal solution for `n = 6` is to split the integers into two groups with equal sums, which can be achieved by putting `1` and `5` in one group and `2`, `3`, and `4` in the other group. This results in both groups having a sum of `6` and an absolute difference of `0`.

The program does not account for this optimal pairing and always uses the pairing strategy described, leading to incorrect results for even values of `n` greater than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
