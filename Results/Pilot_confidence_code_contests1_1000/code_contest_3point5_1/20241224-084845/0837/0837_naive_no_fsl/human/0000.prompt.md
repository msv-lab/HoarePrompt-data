You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya has n integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., n. He wants to split these integers in two non-empty groups in such a way that the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is as small as possible. 

Help Petya to split the integers. Each of n integers should be exactly in one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 60 000) — the number of integers Petya has.

Output

Print the smallest possible absolute difference in the first line.

In the second line print the size of the first group, followed by the integers in that group. You can print these integers in arbitrary order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

4


Output

0
2 1 4 


Input

2


Output

1
1 1 

Note

In the first example you have to put integers 1 and 4 in the first group, and 2 and 3 in the second. This way the sum in each group is 5, and the absolute difference is 0.

In the second example there are only two integers, and since both groups should be non-empty, you have to put one integer in the first group and one in the second. This way the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is 1.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = input()
    arr = range(1, n + 1)
    leftnums = []
    left = 0
    right = 0
    if n == 2:
        left = 1
        right = 2
        leftnums = [1]
    elif n == 3:
        left = 4
        right = 2
        leftnums = [1, 3]
    else:
        for i in range(0, len(arr) / 2, 2):
            left += arr[i] + arr[len(arr) - i - 1]
            leftnums.append(arr[i])
            leftnums.append(arr[len(arr) - i - 1])
            right += arr[i + 1] + arr[len(arr) - i - 2]
    if n % 2 == 1 and n != 3:
        right += arr[n / 2]
    print(abs(left - right))
    print(len(leftnums), *leftnums)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
