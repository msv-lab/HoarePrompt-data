Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of mountain heights and counts the number of inns from which the ocean can be seen. The program initializes `max` to 0 and `ans` to 0. For each mountain height, it checks if the current height is greater than or equal to the maximum height encountered so far. If it is, it updates `max` to the current height and increments `ans`. This ensures that `ans` will contain the number of inns from which the ocean can be seen. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
