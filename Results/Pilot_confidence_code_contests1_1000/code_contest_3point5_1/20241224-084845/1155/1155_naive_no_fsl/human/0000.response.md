Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is not achievable with the digits 4 and 7. Specifically, the program fails to check if a combination of 4s and 7s can sum up to `n`. 

For example, if the input is `10`, the program should return `-1` because there is no way to form a lucky number using only the digits 4 and 7 that sums up to 10. However, the current implementation only checks if `n - 4 * i` is divisible by 7 and does not ensure that both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. 

To fix this, you need to ensure that both `x` and `y` are valid before constructing the answer. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = []
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n // 4 + 1):
        if (n - 4 * i) % 7 == 0:
            x = i
            y = (n - 4 * x) // 7
            if x >= 0 and y >= 0:
                print('4' * x + '7' * y)
                return
    print(-1)

func()
```

This version ensures that `x` and `y` are non-negative before constructing the lucky number, thus correctly handling all cases.
