Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ratios**: The program uses `gcd` to simplify the ratio `a:b`, but it doesn't handle the condition that both `a` and `b` cannot be zero simultaneously. It also doesn't correctly check if the ratio is the same across different segments of the string.

2. **Logic for Splitting the String**: The program attempts to split the string into parts and check the ratios, but it doesn't ensure that the ratios are the same for all valid splits. Instead, it simply increments a counter whenever a new valid ratio is found, which is not correct.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program doesn't handle edge cases properly, such as strings where the ratio is the same throughout, or strings with alternating 'D' and 'K' characters. For example, the string 'DKDKDDDDK' is handled incorrectly.

Here's an example where the program fails:
- **Input**: `9\nDKDKDDDDK`
- **Expected Output**: `1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 3`
- **Actual Output**: The program will produce incorrect results because it doesn't correctly handle the ratios and splitting logic.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a logic that checks the ratio for each segment of the string and ensures that the ratios are the same across all segments.
