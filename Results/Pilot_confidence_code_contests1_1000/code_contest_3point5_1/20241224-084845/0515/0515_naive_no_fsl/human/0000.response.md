Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `scipy.sparse.csgraph.dijkstra` to calculate the shortest paths from a single source vertex (0 in this case) to all other vertices. However, the problem requires finding the shortest path between two vertices through a specific vertex `K`. The program calculates the shortest path from vertex 0 to `K` and then adds the shortest path from `K` to the destination vertex, which does not necessarily give the correct shortest path between the two query vertices through `K`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2 1
1 3 1
2 4 1
3 5 1
3 1
2 4
2 3
4 5
```

The expected output is:

```
3
2
4
```

However, the program's output would be:

```
2
2
4
```

This is because the program calculates the shortest path from vertex 0 to `K` (vertex 3) and then adds the shortest path from `K` to the destination vertex, which does not account for the direct connection between vertices 2 and 4. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the shortest path through `K`.

Since the program does not handle the requirement correctly for at least one input case, the correctness is **False**.
