Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the dragon overtakes the princess exactly at the castle. According to the problem description, if the dragon overtakes the princess at the exact moment she reaches the castle, she should be considered successful without needing an extra bijou. However, the current implementation adds an extra bijou in such a scenario, leading to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
1
1
10
```
The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it adds an extra bijou when the dragon overtakes the princess at the castle.

To fix this, you can modify the condition where the bijou is added to check if the princess has already reached the castle:
```python
def func():
    vp = int(input())
    vd = int(input())
    t_read = int(input())
    f = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                if pl + vp < c:  # Check if the princess hasn't reached the castle yet
                    pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        t += 1
    print(count)
```

This modification ensures that the princess does not need an extra bijou if she has already reached the castle when the dragon overtakes her.
