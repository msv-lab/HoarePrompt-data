You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After his wife's tragic death, Eurydice, Orpheus descended to the realm of death to see her. Reaching its gates was uneasy, but passing through them proved to be even more challenging. Mostly because of Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades. 

Orpheus, a famous poet, and musician plans to calm Cerberus with his poetry and safely walk past him. He created a very peculiar poem for Cerberus. It consists only of lowercase English letters. 

We call a poem's substring a palindrome if and only if it reads the same backwards and forwards. A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deleting several (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.

Unfortunately, Cerberus dislikes palindromes of length greater than 1. For example in the poem abaa the hound of Hades wouldn't like substrings aba and aa.

Orpheus can only calm Cerberus if the hound likes his poetry. That's why he wants to change his poem so that it does not contain any palindrome substrings of length greater than 1.

Orpheus can modify the poem by replacing a letter at any position with any lowercase English letter. He can use this operation arbitrarily many times (possibly zero). Since there can be many palindromes in his poem, he may have to make some corrections. But how many, exactly? Given the poem, determine the minimal number of letters that have to be changed so that the poem does not contain any palindromes of length greater than 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) denoting the number of test cases, then t test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, Orpheus' poem.

The sum of the length of Orpheus' poems in all test cases will not exceed 10^5.

Output

You should output t lines, i-th line should contain a single integer, answer to the i-th test case.

Example

Input


7
babba
abaac
codeforces
zeroorez
abcdcba
bbbbbbb
a


Output


1
1
0
1
1
4
0

Note

In the first test case, we can replace the third character with c and obtain a palindrome-less poem bacba.

In the second test case, we can replace the third character with d and obtain a palindrome-less poem abdac.

In the third test case, the initial poem already doesn't contain any palindromes, so Orpheus doesn't need to change anything there.
Program:
```
import os
import sys
from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    raw_input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    for _ in xrange(int(input())):
        s = list(input().strip())
        n = len(s)
        lst1 = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        lst = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i + 1] == s[i - 1] == s[i]:
                s[i] = ans
                s[i + 1] = ans + 1
                ans += 2
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i - 1] == s[i + 1]:
                s[i + 1] = ans
                ans += 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                s[i] = ans
                ans += 1
        print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
