Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the program does not effectively eliminate all palindromic substrings of length greater than 1. Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
ababa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly outputs `0`, indicating that no changes are needed, which is incorrect.

### Reasoning:
- The program attempts to replace characters to avoid creating palindromes of length greater than 1. However, the logic used to identify and replace characters is flawed.
- In the test case `ababa`, the program fails to recognize that both `aba` and `baba` are palindromes and does not replace the necessary characters to break these palindromes.
- The program's approach of comparing adjacent characters and trying to avoid equal characters is insufficient for identifying and breaking all palindromic substrings.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed to ensure that no palindromic substrings of length greater than 1 exist. This might involve dynamic programming or a different algorithmic approach to systematically check and modify the string.
