Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `N` is a power of 10 minus 1 (e.g., 9, 99, 999, etc.). For such numbers, the maximum sum of digits is not calculated correctly. 

For example, consider the input `N = 999`. The expected output is `27` (since the number `999` itself gives the maximum digit sum), but the program outputs `18`.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the case where all digits are `9` and does not account for the full potential sum of `9`s. To fix this, the program needs to check if the number consists entirely of `9`s and, if so, calculate the sum accordingly.
