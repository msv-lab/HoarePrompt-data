Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify whether the given segments form a valid rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. 

Consider the following input:
```
0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0
```

This input represents a square, which is a special type of rectangle. However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because the distances between the points do not match the criteria set by the function `func_2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the four given segments form a closed shape and that the opposite sides are equal in length. The current implementation does not fully check these conditions.
