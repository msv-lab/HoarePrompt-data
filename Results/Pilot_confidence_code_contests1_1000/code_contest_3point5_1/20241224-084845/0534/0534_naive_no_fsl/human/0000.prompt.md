You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Several months later Alex finally got his brother Bob's creation by post. And now, in his turn, Alex wants to boast about something to his brother. He thought for a while, and came to the conclusion that he has no ready creations, and decided to write a program for rectangles detection. According to his plan, the program detects if the four given segments form a rectangle of a positive area and with sides parallel to coordinate axes. As Alex does badly at school and can't write this program by himself, he asks you to help him.

Input

The input data contain four lines. Each of these lines contains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 ( - 109 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 109) — coordinates of segment's beginning and end positions. The given segments can degenerate into points.

Output

Output the word «YES», if the given four segments form the required rectangle, otherwise output «NO».

Examples

Input

1 1 6 1
1 0 6 0
6 0 6 1
1 1 1 0


Output

YES


Input

0 0 0 3
2 0 0 0
2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2


Output

NO
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
import unittest

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3(sys.stdin, sys.stdout)

def func_1(seg):
    return (seg[0][0] - seg[1][0]) ** 2 + (seg[0][1] - seg[1][1]) ** 2

def func_2(inf):
    points = []
    ret = []
    for i in range(4):
        (x, y, x1, y1) = map(int, inf.readline().split())
        (f, t) = ([x, y], [x1, y1])
        points.append(f)
        points.append(t)
        ret.append([f, t])
    points.sort()
    for i in range(4):
        if points[2 * i] != points[2 * i + 1]:
            return 'NO'
    m = [func_1(d) for d in ret]
    m.sort()
    if m[0] != m[1]:
        return 'NO'
    if m[2] != m[3]:
        return 'NO'
    if m[0] == 0:
        return 'NO'
    if func_1([points[0], points[4]]) != func_1([points[2], points[6]]):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_3(inf, outf):
    outf.write('%s\n' % func_2(inf))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
