You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a_1, a_2, ... , a_n, which is sorted in non-decreasing order (a_i ≤ a_{i + 1}). 

Find three indices i, j, k such that 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n and it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to a_i, a_j and a_k (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides 3, 4 and 5 but impossible with sides 3, 4 and 7). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) — the length of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ... , a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; a_{i - 1} ≤ a_i) — the array a.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case print the answer to it in one line.

If there is a triple of indices i, j, k (i < j < k) such that it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle having sides equal to a_i, a_j and a_k, print that three indices in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Otherwise, print -1.

Example

Input


3
7
4 6 11 11 15 18 20
4
10 10 10 11
3
1 1 1000000000


Output


2 3 6
-1
1 2 3

Note

In the first test case it is impossible with sides 6, 11 and 18. Note, that this is not the only correct answer.

In the second test case you always can construct a non-degenerate triangle.
Program:
```
def func():
    k = []
    for t in range(int(raw_input())):
        l1 = 0
        s = ''
        p = int(raw_input())
        n = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
        x = n.index(max(n))
        y = n.index(min(n))
        if n[1] < max(n) - min(n):
            l1 = 2
            s = str(y + 1) + ' ' + str(l1) + ' ' + str(x + 1)
            k.append(s)
        else:
            s = -1
            k.append(s)
    for t1 in k:
        print(t1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
