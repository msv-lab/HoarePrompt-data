Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not check all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to form a non-degenerate triangle from three elements in the array. The program attempts to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array and checks a condition based on these values, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
3 4 5 7
3
1 1 2
3
1 2 3
```

The output of the program for the above inputs would be:

```
-1
-1
-1
```

However, the correct outputs should be:

```
1 2 4
1 2 3
-1
```

In the first test case, the program fails to identify that it is impossible to form a non-degenerate triangle with sides 3, 4, and 7. In the second test case, the program incorrectly reports `-1` when it should identify that it is impossible to form a non-degenerate triangle with sides 1, 1, and 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
