Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible combinations of `x` and `y` distances and does not always find the optimal solution.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The program outputs:
```
1
230
```

This is correct because adding a 230 cm mark allows measuring both 185 cm and 230 cm.

However, consider another input:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```

The program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because although the ruler already includes a 185 cm mark, it does not include a 230 cm mark. Therefore, one additional mark at 230 cm is needed to measure both distances.

To handle this correctly, the program should check all possible pairs `(x, y)` and determine the minimum number of additional marks required to cover both distances. The current implementation only checks for a single pair and may miss optimal solutions for some inputs.
