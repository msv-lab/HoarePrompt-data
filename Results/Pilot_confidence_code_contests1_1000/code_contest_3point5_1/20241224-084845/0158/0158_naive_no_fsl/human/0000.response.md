Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the minimum distance to an exit using a breadth-first search (BFS) but does not account for the ability to unlock up to `K` rooms per cast. This means that the program will only consider moving to adjacent rooms and does not take into account the unlocking mechanism, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3 3
.#
S.
###
```

In this case, the program should be able to move to the exit in one cast by unlocking the middle room, but the current implementation does not account for this and incorrectly outputs a result of 1, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, for more complex cases, the program fails to provide the correct minimum number of casts.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to handle the unlocking of rooms within each cast. This involves keeping track of the number of locked rooms that can be unlocked and ensuring that the BFS accounts for both movement and unlocking.
