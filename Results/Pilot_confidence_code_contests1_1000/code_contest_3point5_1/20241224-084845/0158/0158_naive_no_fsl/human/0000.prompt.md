You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi is locked within a building.

This building consists of H×W rooms, arranged in H rows and W columns. We will denote the room at the i-th row and j-th column as (i,j). The state of this room is represented by a character A_{i,j}. If A_{i,j}= `#`, the room is locked and cannot be entered; if A_{i,j}= `.`, the room is not locked and can be freely entered. Takahashi is currently at the room where A_{i,j}= `S`, which can also be freely entered.

Each room in the 1-st row, 1-st column, H-th row or W-th column, has an exit. Each of the other rooms (i,j) is connected to four rooms: (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1) and (i,j+1).

Takahashi will use his magic to get out of the building. In one cast, he can do the following:

* Move to an adjacent room at most K times, possibly zero. Here, locked rooms cannot be entered.
* Then, select and unlock at most K locked rooms, possibly zero. Those rooms will remain unlocked from then on.



His objective is to reach a room with an exit. Find the minimum necessary number of casts to do so.

It is guaranteed that Takahashi is initially at a room without an exit.

Constraints

* 3 ≤ H ≤ 800
* 3 ≤ W ≤ 800
* 1 ≤ K ≤ H×W
* Each A_{i,j} is `#` , `.` or `S`.
* There uniquely exists (i,j) such that A_{i,j}= `S`, and it satisfies 2 ≤ i ≤ H-1 and 2 ≤ j ≤ W-1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W K
A_{1,1}A_{1,2}...A_{1,W}
:
A_{H,1}A_{H,2}...A_{H,W}


Output

Print the minimum necessary number of casts.

                nkey = (nx, ny)
                if A[ny][nx] != '#' and nkey not in used:
                    used.add(nkey)
                    if cost + 1 < k:
                        deq.append((0, nkey))
    ans = 10 ** 18
    for (x, y) in used:
        dx = min(x, w - 1 - x)
        dy = min(y, h - 1 - y)
        ans = min(ans, min(dx, dy))
    print(ans + k - 1) / k + 1

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
