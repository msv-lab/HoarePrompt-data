Takahashi is locked within a building.

This building consists of H×W rooms, arranged in H rows and W columns. We will denote the room at the i-th row and j-th column as (i,j). The state of this room is represented by a character A_{i,j}. If A_{i,j}= `#`, the room is locked and cannot be entered; if A_{i,j}= `.`, the room is not locked and can be freely entered. Takahashi is currently at the room where A_{i,j}= `S`, which can also be freely entered.

Each room in the 1-st row, 1-st column, H-th row or W-th column, has an exit. Each of the other rooms (i,j) is connected to four rooms: (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1) and (i,j+1).

Takahashi will use his magic to get out of the building. In one cast, he can do the following:

* Move to an adjacent room at most K times, possibly zero. Here, locked rooms cannot be entered.
* Then, select and unlock at most K locked rooms, possibly zero. Those rooms will remain unlocked from then on.



His objective is to reach a room with an exit. Find the minimum necessary number of casts to do so.

It is guaranteed that Takahashi is initially at a room without an exit.

Constraints

* 3 ≤ H ≤ 800
* 3 ≤ W ≤ 800
* 1 ≤ K ≤ H×W
* Each A_{i,j} is `#` , `.` or `S`.
* There uniquely exists (i,j) such that A_{i,j}= `S`, and it satisfies 2 ≤ i ≤ H-1 and 2 ≤ j ≤ W-1.
