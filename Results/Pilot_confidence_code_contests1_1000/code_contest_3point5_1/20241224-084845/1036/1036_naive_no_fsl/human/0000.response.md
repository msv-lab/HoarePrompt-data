Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the subrectangle dimensions do not perfectly match the required area `k`. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `k = 3`
- Array `a`: `[1, 0, 1]`
- Array `b`: `[1, 1, 1]`

Expected output: 
- Matrix `c`:
```
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```
- Subrectangles of size 3 consisting only of ones: 4

However, the program incorrectly counts the subrectangles. It does not correctly calculate the number of valid subrectangles by considering all possible row and column combinations. Instead, it uses a simplified approach that does not fully account for all possible subrectangles.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible subrectangles by iterating over all pairs of rows and columns and checking if their intersection forms a subrectangle of size `k` consisting only of ones. The current implementation does not fully cover this requirement.
