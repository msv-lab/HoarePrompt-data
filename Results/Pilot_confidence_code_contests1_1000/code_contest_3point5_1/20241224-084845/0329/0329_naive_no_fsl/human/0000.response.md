Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the greedy algorithm for building the tower as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses binary search to find the maximum \( a \) such that \( a^3 \leq m \), but it does not correctly handle the addition of subsequent blocks.

Let's consider the input `m = 6`. According to the problem description, the optimal solution should be 6 blocks with a total volume of 6. However, the program incorrectly returns (1, 5), which means it only considers one block with a volume of 5.

Here is the step-by-step analysis of why the program fails:

1. For \( m = 6 \):
   - The program finds \( a = 1 \) because \( 1^3 = 1 \leq 6 \).
   - The remaining volume is \( 6 - 1 = 5 \).
   - The program returns (1, 5), indicating that it only considers one block with volume 5.

2. The correct approach would be to consider the following:
   - Add the largest possible block first: \( 1^3 = 1 \), leaving \( 6 - 1 = 5 \).
   - Add the next largest possible block: \( 1^3 = 1 \), leaving \( 5 - 1 = 4 \).
   - Continue until the remaining volume is less than the cube of the next possible block size.
   - This would result in 6 blocks with volumes 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, summing up to 6.

The program fails to correctly simulate the greedy algorithm by only considering the largest possible block at each step without properly handling the remaining volume. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
