You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Limak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely many blocks of each side length.

A block with side a has volume a3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a1, a2, ..., ak has the total volume a13 + a23 + ... + ak3.

Limak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X — the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X.

Limak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X.

Can you help Limak? Find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and the maximum X ≤ m that results this number of blocks.

Input

The only line of the input contains one integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1015), meaning that Limak wants you to choose X between 1 and m, inclusive.

Output

Print two integers — the maximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X, resulting in the maximum number of blocks.

Examples

Input

48


Output

9 42


Input

6


Output

6 6

Note

In the first sample test, there will be 9 blocks if you choose X = 23 or X = 42. Limak wants to maximize X secondarily so you should choose 42.

In more detail, after choosing X = 42 the process of building a tower is:

  * Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42 - 27 = 15. 
  * The second added block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15 - 8 = 7. 
  * Finally, Limak adds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one. 



So, there are 9 blocks in the tower. The total volume is is 33 + 23 + 7·13 = 27 + 8 + 7 = 42.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

m = int(raw_input())
print(*func_1(m))

def func_1(m):
    if m == 0:
        return (0, 0)
    l = 0
    h = m + 1
    while l + 1 != h:
        mid = (l + h) / 2
        if mid ** 3 <= m:
            l = mid
        else:
            h = mid
    a = l
    one = m - a ** 3
    two = a ** 3 - 1 - (a - 1) ** 3
    if one >= two:
        return map(sum, zip(func_1(one), (1, a ** 3)))
    else:
        return map(sum, zip(func_1(two), (1, (a - 1) ** 3)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
