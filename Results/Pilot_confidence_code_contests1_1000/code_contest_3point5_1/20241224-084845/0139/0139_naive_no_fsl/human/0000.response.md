Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple robots with sufficient fuel and distance capabilities are available, but they are not utilized optimally due to sorting and selection logic issues. Specifically, the program sorts the robots based on the ratio of fuel to capacity but does not ensure that the most capable robots are used first. This can lead to suboptimal solutions where fewer robots are transported than could be if the selection logic was more robust.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 8 10
0 12 3
1 1 0
0 3 11
1 6 9
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution should be to transport 4 robots (all except the one with `ci=0` and `fi=12`) using 9 liters of fuel. However, the current implementation might not select the robot with `ci=1`, `fi=1`, and `li=0` first, leading to an incorrect result. The program should ensure that the most capable robots are prioritized, which this implementation does not do correctly.
