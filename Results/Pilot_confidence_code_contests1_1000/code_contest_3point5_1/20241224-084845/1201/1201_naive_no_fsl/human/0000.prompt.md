You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n stacks of blocks. The i-th stack contains h_i blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the i-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the i + 1-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing?

Note that the number of stacks always remains n: stacks don't disappear when they have 0 blocks.

Input

First line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line of each test case contains n integers h_i (0 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — starting heights of the stacks.

It's guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case output YES if you can make the sequence of heights strictly increasing and NO otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


6
2
1 2
2
1 0
3
4 4 4
2
0 0
3
0 1 0
4
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000


Output


YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case there is no need to make any moves, the sequence of heights is already increasing.

In the second test case we need to move one block from the first stack to the second. Then the heights become 0 1.

In the third test case we could move one block from the first stack to the second and then from the second to the third, which would make the heights 3 4 5.

In the fourth test case we can't make a move, but the sequence is not increasing, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth test case we can only make one move (from the second to the third stack), which would make the heights 0 0 1. Both 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 are not increasing sequences, so the answer is NO.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
