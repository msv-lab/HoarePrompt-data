Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program simply prints the first input line without performing any operations to check if the sequence of heights can be made strictly increasing. This means it will not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the sequence of heights strictly increasing for any given input.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
3
4 2 1
```

The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to make the sequence [4, 2, 1] strictly increasing by moving blocks between stacks. However, the current program will output something else since it does not perform the necessary checks.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
