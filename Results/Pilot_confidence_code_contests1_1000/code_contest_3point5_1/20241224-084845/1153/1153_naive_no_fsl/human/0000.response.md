Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the first card is a trump card and the second card is a non-trump card. According to the problem description, a trump card can beat any non-trump card regardless of their ranks. However, the provided solution only checks if the suits of the two cards are different and the first card's suit is the trump suit, which is insufficient.

For example, consider the following input:

Input

```
C
AS 9H
```

Expected Output:

```
YES
```

However, the program will output:

```
NO
```

This is because the program does not correctly implement the rule that a trump card (in this case, `AS`) can beat any non-trump card (`9H`). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
