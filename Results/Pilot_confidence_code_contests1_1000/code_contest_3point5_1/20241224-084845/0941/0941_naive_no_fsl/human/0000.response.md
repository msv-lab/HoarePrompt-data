Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it processes the digits within a line. Specifically, it appends digits to `digit` without properly converting the list of bytes back into an integer before summing. This results in the program concatenating all digits instead of summing them up individually. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
Thereare100100yenonthetable.Iam17yearsold.
Ishouldgohomeat6pm.
```

The program would output:
```
100100100176
```

However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
123123
```

This is because the sum of the numbers "100", "100", "100", "17", "6" should be calculated separately for each instance. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
