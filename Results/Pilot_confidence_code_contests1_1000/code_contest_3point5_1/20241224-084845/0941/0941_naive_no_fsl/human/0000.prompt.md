You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The new PIN is hard to remember. I was told that I shouldn't take notes, but I don't think I can remember them. Therefore, I decided to embed a numerical value in the text and make a note of the PIN. Here, the sum of all the numbers is the PIN.

Create a program that reads the memorandum and outputs the PIN code.



Input

Sentences with embedded positive integers are given over multiple lines. Each line is a character string containing single-byte alphanumeric characters, symbols, and spaces, or a blank line. However, you are guaranteed to enter no more than 80 characters per line and a PIN of 10,000 or less.

Output

The PIN (the sum of positive integers in the text) is output on one line.

Example

Input

Thereare100yenonthetable.Iam17yearsold.
Ishouldgohomeat6pm.


Output

123
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func():
    s = 0
    for line in stdin:
        digit = bytearray()
        for c in line:
            if c.isdigit():
                digit.append(c)
            elif digit:
                s += int(digit)
                digit = bytearray()
    print(s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
