Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to check a few specific conditions but does not account for all possible scenarios where the rotations could sum up to 360 degrees in total, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
10
20
30
```

The correct solution would check if it is possible to achieve a net rotation of 0 degrees through any combination of clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. However, the provided program does not handle this logic properly. It only checks a few specific conditions and appends values to the `yes` list without considering the direction of the rotations.

A correct approach would involve generating all possible combinations of clockwise and counterclockwise rotations and checking if any of these combinations result in a net rotation of 0 degrees. The current implementation is insufficient and fails to cover all necessary cases.
