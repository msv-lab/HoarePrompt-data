You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iahub recently has learned Bubble Sort, an algorithm that is used to sort a permutation with n elements a1, a2, ..., an in ascending order. He is bored of this so simple algorithm, so he invents his own graph. The graph (let's call it G) initially has n vertices and 0 edges. During Bubble Sort execution, edges appear as described in the following algorithm (pseudocode). 
    
    
      
    procedure bubbleSortGraph()  
        build a graph G with n vertices and 0 edges  
        repeat  
            swapped = false  
            for i = 1 to n - 1 inclusive do:  
                if a[i] > a[i + 1] then  
                    add an undirected edge in G between a[i] and a[i + 1]  
                    swap( a[i], a[i + 1] )  
                    swapped = true  
                end if  
            end for  
        until not swapped   
        /* repeat the algorithm as long as swapped value is true. */   
    end procedure  
    

For a graph, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (so there are no edges between vertices of an independent set). A maximum independent set is an independent set which has maximum cardinality. Given the permutation, find the size of the maximum independent set of graph G, if we use such permutation as the premutation a in procedure bubbleSortGraph.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output

Output a single integer — the answer to the problem. 

Examples

Input

3
3 1 2


Output

2

Note

Consider the first example. Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now [1, 3, 2]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is [1, 2].
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from bisect import *

def func():
    class segmenttree:
    
        def __init__(self, arr, n):
            (self.tree, self.n) = ([0] * (2 * n), n)
            if arr:
                for i in range(2 * n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if i >= n:
                        self.tree[i] = arr[i - n]
                    else:
                        self.tree[i] = max(self.tree[i << 1], self.tree[(i << 1) + 1])
    
        def query(self, l, r):
            res = 0
            l += self.n
            r += self.n
            while l < r:
                if l & 1:
                    res = max(self.tree[l], res)
                    l += 1
                if r & 1:
                    r -= 1
                    res = max(self.tree[r], res)
                l >>= 1
                r >>= 1
            return res
    
        def update(self, ix, val):
            ix += self.n
            self.tree[ix] = val
            while ix > 1:
                self.tree[ix >> 1] = max(self.tree[ix], self.tree[ix ^ 1])
                ix >>= 1
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, a, tree) = (int(input()), rints(), segmenttree([], 10 ** 5 + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        val = tree.query(0, a[i])
        tree.update(a[i], val + 1)
    print(tree.query(0, n + 1))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
