Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program seems to be implementing a Segment Tree to keep track of some values, but it does not construct the graph as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not add edges between vertices based on the conditions of the Bubble Sort algorithm. Instead, it appears to be updating a segment tree with values from the input array, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the size of the maximum independent set of the graph constructed by the Bubble Sort algorithm.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the Bubble Sort algorithm, construct the graph by adding edges when necessary, and then find the size of the maximum independent set of the resulting graph. The current implementation does not achieve this and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
