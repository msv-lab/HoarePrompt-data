Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that each key is paired with exactly one other key, and it does not properly handle the scenario where no swaps are needed. Let's consider a case where the program might fail:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  helloworld
  helloworld
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

However, the current implementation does not correctly identify this case. It tries to find pairs and prints `-1` if it cannot find valid pairs, but it does not handle the scenario where no swaps are needed.

### Issue:
- The program checks if `s` and `t` are identical and prints `0` directly. However, it also attempts to find pairs and prints `-1` if it fails to find valid pairs. This means that for the case where `s` and `t` are identical, the program still tries to find pairs, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Fix:
- The program should check if `s` and `t` are identical first and print `0` directly if they are. This would simplify the logic and ensure that the program handles the case correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    t = input()
    
    if s == t:
        print(0)
        return
    
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    pairs = {i: -1 for i in alphabet}
    added = {i: False for i in alphabet}
    
    for i in range(len(t)):
        if pairs[t[i]] == -1 and not added[s[i]]:
            pairs[t[i]] = s[i]
            pairs[s[i]] = t[i]
            added[s[i]] = True
        elif pairs[t[i]] != s[i] and pairs[s[i]] != t[i]:
            print(-1)
            return
    
    # Check if the resulting mapping forms a valid set of pairs
    for i in range(len(t)):
        if pairs[t[i]] == -1:
            print(-1)
            return
    
    qty = 0
    valid_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(alphabet)):
        if pairs[alphabet[i]] != -1 and pairs[alphabet[i]] != alphabet[i]:
            valid_pairs.append((alphabet[i], pairs[alphabet[i]]))
            qty += 1
    
    print(qty)
    for (key, value) in valid_pairs:
        print(f'{key} {value}')
    return

func_1()
```

This corrected version first checks if `s` and `t` are identical and prints `0` directly if they are, ensuring that the program handles this case correctly.
