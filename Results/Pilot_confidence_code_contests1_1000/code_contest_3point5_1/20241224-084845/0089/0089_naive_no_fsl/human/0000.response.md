Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple special vertices and the graph structure allows for different farthest distances for each special vertex. Specifically, the program uses union-find to merge sets but does not correctly compute the distances between special vertices. It also does not initialize the distances properly or update them during the process.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
4 5 3
1 2 3
1 2 5
4 2 1
2 3 2
1 4 4
1 3 3
```

The expected output is `3 3 3`, but the program does not produce this output. Instead, it appears to use a fixed distance value `x` derived from the first edge processed, which does not account for the actual farthest distances from each special vertex.

Here is a breakdown of why the program fails:
1. The program uses union-find to merge sets but does not use it to compute distances.
2. The distance calculation logic is missing, and the program incorrectly assumes a fixed distance.
3. The program does not handle the requirement to find the farthest special vertex for each special vertex.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
