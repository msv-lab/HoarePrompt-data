You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Chouti was tired of the tedious homework, so he opened up an old programming problem he created years ago.

You are given a connected undirected graph with n vertices and m weighted edges. There are k special vertices: x_1, x_2, …, x_k.

Let's define the cost of the path as the maximum weight of the edges in it. And the distance between two vertexes as the minimum cost of the paths connecting them.

For each special vertex, find another special vertex which is farthest from it (in terms of the previous paragraph, i.e. the corresponding distance is maximum possible) and output the distance between them.

The original constraints are really small so he thought the problem was boring. Now, he raises the constraints and hopes you can solve it for him.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, n-1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of special vertices.

The second line contains k distinct integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n).

Each of the following m lines contains three integers u, v and w (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), denoting there is an edge between u and v of weight w. The given graph is undirected, so an edge (u, v) can be used in the both directions.

The graph may have multiple edges and self-loops.

It is guaranteed, that the graph is connected.

Output

The first and only line should contain k integers. The i-th integer is the distance between x_i and the farthest special vertex from it.

Examples

Input

2 3 2
2 1
1 2 3
1 2 2
2 2 1


Output

2 2 


Input

4 5 3
1 2 3
1 2 5
4 2 1
2 3 2
1 4 4
1 3 3


Output

3 3 3 

Note

In the first example, the distance between vertex 1 and 2 equals to 2 because one can walk through the edge of weight 2 connecting them. So the distance to the farthest node for both 1 and 2 equals to 2.

In the second example, one can find that distance between 1 and 2, distance between 1 and 3 are both 3 and the distance between 2 and 3 is 2.

The graph may have multiple edges between and self-loops, as in the first example.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
ind = [int(i) for i in input().split() if i != '\n']
special = [0] * n
for i in range(k):
    special[ind[i] - 1] = 1
p = [i for i in range(n)]
store = []
sz = [0] * n
for i in range(m):
    (x, y, w) = map(int, input().split())
    store.append([w, x - 1, y - 1])
store.sort()
i = 0
while True:
    g = func_1(store[i][1])
    h = func_1(store[i][2])
    if g != h:
        t = func_2(store[i][1], store[i][2])
        if t == 1:
            x = store[i][0]
            break
    i += 1
ans = [x for i in range(k)]
ans = ' '.join(map(str, ans))
sys.stdout.write(ans)

def func_1(x):
    while p[x] != x:
        x = p[p[x]]
    return x

def func_2(u, v):
    a = func_1(u)
    b = func_1(v)
    if sz[a] > sz[b]:
        p[b] = a
        special[a] += special[b]
        if special[a] == k:
            return 1
    elif sz[a] < sz[b]:
        p[a] = b
        special[b] += special[a]
        if special[b] == k:
            return 1
    else:
        p[b] = a
        sz[a] += 1
        special[a] += special[b]
        if special[a] == k:
            return 1
    return 0


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
