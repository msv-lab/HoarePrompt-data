Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input `n` is 2. According to the problem description, for `n = 2`, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation since the only possible values for `a` and `b` are 2, and no valid `x` exists such that `2 * x = 2` or `2 * x = 2` with `|x| > 1`.

The program calculates the maximum score by iterating from 2 to `n` and adding `4 * cur` to the answer for each iteration. This approach works for `n > 2`, but for `n = 2`, it will output 0, which is incorrect because the problem states that the maximum score for `n = 2` should be 0.

To fix this, the program should include a special case check for `n = 2`:

```python
if n == 2:
    print(0)
else:
    # existing code
    (n, ans) = (int(input()), 0)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        cur = 2
        while i * cur <= n:
            ans += 4 * cur
            cur += 1
    print(ans)
```

With this modification, the program would correctly handle the case for `n = 2`.
