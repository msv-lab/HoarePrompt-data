Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the k-amazing numbers for all cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where multiple values have the same frequency in the subsegments of length k. The current implementation only considers the last occurrence of the minimum value in subsegments of length k, which might not always yield the correct k-amazing number.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
1 1 2 2 3
5
4 4 4 4 2
6
1 3 1 5 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
-1 -1 1 1 1 
-1 4 4 4 2 
-1 -1 1 1 1 1 
```

Actual Output (from the provided code):
```
-1 -1 3 2 1 
-1 4 4 4 2 
-1 -1 1 1 1 1 
```

In the first test case, for k=2, both 1 and 2 occur twice in the subsegments, but the program returns 3 as the 2-amazing number, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, as 1 is the minimum value occurring in all subsegments of length 2.

This failure indicates that the program does not correctly track the minimum values across all subsegments for each k. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
