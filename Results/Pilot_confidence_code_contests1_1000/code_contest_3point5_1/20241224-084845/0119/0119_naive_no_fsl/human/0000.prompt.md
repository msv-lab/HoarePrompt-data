You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a Petri dish with bacteria and you are preparing to dive into the harsh micro-world. But, unfortunately, you don't have any microscope nearby, so you can't watch them.

You know that you have n bacteria in the Petri dish and size of the i-th bacteria is a_i. Also you know intergalactic positive integer constant K.

The i-th bacteria can swallow the j-th bacteria if and only if a_i > a_j and a_i ≤ a_j + K. The j-th bacteria disappear, but the i-th bacteria doesn't change its size. The bacteria can perform multiple swallows. On each swallow operation any bacteria i can swallow any bacteria j if a_i > a_j and a_i ≤ a_j + K. The swallow operations go one after another.

For example, the sequence of bacteria sizes a=[101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54] and K=1. The one of possible sequences of swallows is: [101, 53, 42, 102, \underline{101}, 55, 54] → [101, \underline{53}, 42, 102, 55, 54] → [\underline{101}, 42, 102, 55, 54] → [42, 102, 55, \underline{54}] → [42, 102, 55]. In total there are 3 bacteria remained in the Petri dish.

Since you don't have a microscope, you can only guess, what the minimal possible number of bacteria can remain in your Petri dish when you finally will find any microscope.

Input

The first line contains two space separated positive integers n and K (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6) — number of bacteria and intergalactic constant K.

The second line contains n space separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — sizes of bacteria you have.

Output

Print the only integer — minimal possible number of bacteria can remain.

Note

The first example is clarified in the problem statement.

In the second example an optimal possible sequence of swallows is: [20, 15, 10, 15, \underline{20}, 25] → [20, 15, 10, \underline{15}, 25] → [20, 15, \underline{10}, 25] → [20, \underline{15}, 25] → [\underline{20}, 25] → [25].

In the third example no bacteria can swallow any other bacteria.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    freq = dict()
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)
        freq[i] += 1
    arr = list(set(arr))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = freq[arr[0]]
    pres = arr[0]
    for i in arr[1:]:
        if pres > i and pres <= i + k:
            pass
        else:
            ans += freq[i]
        pres = i
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
