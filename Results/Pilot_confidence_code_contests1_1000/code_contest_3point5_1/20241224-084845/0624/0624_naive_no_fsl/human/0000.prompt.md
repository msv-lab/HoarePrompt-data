You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Homer has two friends Alice and Bob. Both of them are string fans. 

One day, Alice and Bob decide to play a game on a string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_n of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. They move in turns alternatively and Alice makes the first move.

In a move, a player must choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) that has not been chosen before, and change s_i to any other lowercase English letter c that c ≠ s_i.

When all indices have been chosen, the game ends. 

The goal of Alice is to make the final string lexicographically as small as possible, while the goal of Bob is to make the final string lexicographically as large as possible. Both of them are game experts, so they always play games optimally. Homer is not a game expert, so he wonders what the final string will be.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: 

  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; 
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, print the final string in a single line.

Example

Input


3
a
bbbb
az


Output


b
azaz
by

Note

In the first test case: Alice makes the first move and must change the only letter to a different one, so she changes it to 'b'.

In the second test case: Alice changes the first letter to 'a', then Bob changes the second letter to 'z', Alice changes the third letter to 'a' and then Bob changes the fourth letter to 'z'.

In the third test case: Alice changes the first letter to 'b', and then Bob changes the second letter to 'y'.
Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = list(raw_input())
        s.pop(-1)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                if s[i] != 'a':
                    s[i] = 'a'
                else:
                    s[i] = 'b'
            elif s[i] != 'z':
                s[i] = 'z'
            else:
                s[i] = 'y'
        print(''.join(s))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
