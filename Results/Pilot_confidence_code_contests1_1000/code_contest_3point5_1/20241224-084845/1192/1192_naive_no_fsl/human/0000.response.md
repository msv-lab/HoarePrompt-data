Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It constructs the graph representing friendships and uses breadth-first search (BFS) to determine the number of users who will know the news starting from each user. The BFS ensures that all reachable nodes from a starting user are identified, and the program updates the count accordingly. Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. No edge cases were found that would cause the program to fail, hence the correctness is True.
