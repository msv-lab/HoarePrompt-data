You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In some social network, there are n users communicating with each other in m groups of friends. Let's analyze the process of distributing some news between users.

Initially, some user x receives the news from some source. Then he or she sends the news to his or her friends (two users are friends if there is at least one group such that both of them belong to this group). Friends continue sending the news to their friends, and so on. The process ends when there is no pair of friends such that one of them knows the news, and another one doesn't know.

For each user x you have to determine what is the number of users that will know the news if initially only user x starts distributing it. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of users and the number of groups of friends, respectively.

Then m lines follow, each describing a group of friends. The i-th line begins with integer k_i (0 ≤ k_i ≤ n) — the number of users in the i-th group. Then k_i distinct integers follow, denoting the users belonging to the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that ∑ _{i = 1}^{m} k_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print n integers. The i-th integer should be equal to the number of users that will know the news if user i starts distributing it.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
