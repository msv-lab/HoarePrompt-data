Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of marks above the water level on subsequent days decreases or stays the same without considering the correct positioning of marks. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4
0 1 1 2
```

For this input, the expected output should be `0`, as shown in the optimal case where marks are positioned correctly without any marks being submerged. However, the current implementation does not ensure that marks are placed in such a way to minimize the number of marks submerged. For instance, on the third day, the program might not correctly place the mark, leading to more marks being submerged than necessary. Therefore, the program fails to produce the correct result for this case.
