You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is going to sleep now and wants to set his alarm clock. There will be many necessary events tomorrow, the i-th of them will start during the x_i-th minute. Ivan doesn't want to skip any of the events, so he has to set his alarm clock in such a way that it rings during minutes x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, so he will be awake during each of these minutes (note that it does not matter if his alarm clock will ring during any other minute).

Ivan can choose two properties for the alarm clock — the first minute it will ring (let's denote it as y) and the interval between two consecutive signals (let's denote it by p). After the clock is set, it will ring during minutes y, y + p, y + 2p, y + 3p and so on.

Ivan can choose any minute as the first one, but he cannot choose any arbitrary value of p. He has to pick it among the given values p_1, p_2, ..., p_m (his phone does not support any other options for this setting).

So Ivan has to choose the first minute y when the alarm clock should start ringing and the interval between two consecutive signals p_j in such a way that it will ring during all given minutes x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (and it does not matter if his alarm clock will ring in any other minutes).

Your task is to tell the first minute y and the index j such that if Ivan sets his alarm clock with properties y and p_j it will ring during all given minutes x_1, x_2, ..., x_n or say that it is impossible to choose such values of the given properties. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of events and the number of possible settings for the interval between signals.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^{18}), where x_i is the minute when i-th event starts. It is guaranteed that all x_i are given in increasing order (i. e. the condition x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n holds).

The third line of the input contains m integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_m (1 ≤ p_j ≤ 10^{18}), where p_j is the j-th option for the interval between two consecutive signals.

Output

If it's impossible to choose such values y and j so all constraints are satisfied, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. Then print two integers y (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^{18}) and j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) in the second line, where y is the first minute Ivan's alarm clock should start ringing and j is the index of the option for the interval between two consecutive signals (options are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given input). These values should be chosen in such a way that the alarm clock will ring during all given minutes x_1, x_2, ..., x_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
