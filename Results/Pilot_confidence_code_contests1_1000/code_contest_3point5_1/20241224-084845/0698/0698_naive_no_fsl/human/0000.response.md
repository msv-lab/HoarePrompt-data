Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the event times `x`. This GCD (`g`) represents the smallest interval that needs to be covered to ensure the alarm rings at all given event times.

2. **Checking Divisibility**: For each possible interval `p_j` given in the input, the program checks if `g` is divisible by `p_j`. If it is, then setting the alarm to start at the first event time `x[0]` and using the interval `p_j` will ensure that the alarm rings at all required times.

3. **Output**: If a valid interval `p_j` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the starting time `x[0]` and the index of the valid interval `j + 1`.

4. **Handling All Cases**: The logic ensures that the solution works for any set of event times and intervals. The use of GCD guarantees that any interval that can evenly cover the smallest gap between the event times is considered.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
