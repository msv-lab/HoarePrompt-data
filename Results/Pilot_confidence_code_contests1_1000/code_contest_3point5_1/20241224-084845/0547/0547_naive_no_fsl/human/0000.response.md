Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the skills are already at their maximum value (100). Specifically, the program continues to attempt to improve skills until it runs out of improvement units, but it does not properly account for skills that are already at 100. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
99 100
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy is to increase the first skill to 100, resulting in a total rating of \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor = 10 + 10 = 20 \).

However, the program attempts to increment the first skill again, even though it is already at 100, and does not update the total rating correctly. This leads to an incorrect output of 2 instead of 20.

To fix this issue, the program needs to handle skills that are already at 100 differently, ensuring that they are not incremented further.
