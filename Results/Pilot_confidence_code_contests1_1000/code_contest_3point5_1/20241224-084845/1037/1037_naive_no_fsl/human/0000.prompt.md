You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations: 

  1. Pay a dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by 1. For example, if x = 0 and y = 7 there are four possible outcomes after this operation: 
    * x = 0, y = 6; 
    * x = 0, y = 8; 
    * x = -1, y = 7; 
    * x = 1, y = 7. 

  2. Pay b dollars and increase or decrease both integers by 1. For example, if x = 0 and y = 7 there are two possible outcomes after this operation: 
    * x = -1, y = 6; 
    * x = 1, y = 8. 



Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. x = y = 0. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from x=1, y=0 to x=y=0.

Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).

The second line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print one integer — the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend.

Example

Input


2
1 3
391 555
0 0
9 4


Output


1337
0

Note

In the first test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: first, second, first. This way you spend 391 + 555 + 391 = 1337 dollars.

In the second test case both integers are equal to zero initially, so you dont' have to spend money.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
