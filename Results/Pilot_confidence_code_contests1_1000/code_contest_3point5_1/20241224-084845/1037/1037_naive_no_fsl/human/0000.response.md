Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the cost of performing two operations (one with `a` and one with `b`) might be cheaper than performing one operation with `b` twice. Specifically, the cost calculation for `cst1` and `cst2` does not cover all possible scenarios.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 2
  10 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  10
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  15
  ```

Explanation for the expected output:
- The most efficient way to make `x` and `y` both zero is to use the operation that costs `a` for each unit change, since `a < b`. We need to change `x` from 1 to 0 (cost: `10 * 1 = 10`) and `y` from 2 to 0 (cost: `5 * 2 = 10`). The total cost is `10 + 10 = 20`, but since we are only changing `y` once, the correct cost should be `10`.

However, the program calculates:
- `cst1 = max(10 * (1 - 1) + 10 * (2 - 1) + 5, 0) = max(10, 0) = 10`
- `cst2 = max(0, 10 * abs(2 - 1) + 5 * min(1, 2)) = max(0, 15) = 15`

The program then selects the minimum of these two values, which is 10. However, the correct answer should be 10, not 15.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where using two individual `a` operations might be cheaper than one combined `b` operation. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
