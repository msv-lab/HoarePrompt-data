Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated string is lexicographically smallest. Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
9 3
abaabaaaa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abaabaaab
```

However, the program might generate a different string that is not lexicographically smallest. For example, it might generate "abaabaaaab", which is not the lexicographically smallest beautiful string.

The issue lies in the way the program tries to increment characters and distribute the remaining characters. It does not guarantee that the resulting string will be the lexicographically smallest one that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
