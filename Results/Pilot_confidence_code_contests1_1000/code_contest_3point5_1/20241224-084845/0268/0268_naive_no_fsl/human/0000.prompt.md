You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and a number k. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters beautiful if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by k. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string s. If such a string does not exist, output -1.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: 

  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; 
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases.

The next 2 ⋅ T lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of the description contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of string s and number k respectively.

The second line contains string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case output in a separate line lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n, which is greater or equal to string s, or -1 if such a string does not exist.

Example

Input


4
4 2
abcd
3 1
abc
4 3
aaaa
9 3
abaabaaaa


Output


acac
abc
-1
abaabaaab

Note

In the first test case "acac" is greater than or equal to s, and each letter appears 2 or 0 times in it, so it is beautiful.

In the second test case each letter appears 0 or 1 times in s, so s itself is the answer.

We can show that there is no suitable string in the third test case.

In the fourth test case each letter appears 0, 3, or 6 times in "abaabaaab". All these integers are divisible by 3.
Program:
```
for _ in range(input()):
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = list(raw_input())
    freq = [0] * 26
    if func_1(s, freq, k, 0):
        print(''.join(s))
    else:
        print(-1)

def func_1(s, freq, k, i):
    if i == len(s):
        return False
    freq[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
    if func_1(s, freq, k, i + 1):
        return s
    freq[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    if s[i] == 'z':
        return False
    else:
        for c in range(ord(s[i]) + 1, ord('z') + 1):
            freq[c - ord('a')] += 1
            mand = 0
            for j in range(26):
                if freq[j] % k != 0:
                    mand += k - freq[j] % k
            left = n - i - 1
            if left < mand or (left - mand) % k != 0:
                freq[c - ord('a')] -= 1
                continue
            else:
                s[i] = chr(c)
                remain = []
                for j in range(26):
                    if freq[j] % k != 0:
                        remain += [chr(ord('a') + j)] * (k - freq[j] % k)
                if mand < left:
                    remain += ['a'] * (left - mand)
                remain.sort()
                s[i + 1:] = remain
                return True
        return False


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
