You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n piles of pebbles on the table, the i-th pile contains ai pebbles. Your task is to paint each pebble using one of the k given colors so that for each color c and any two piles i and j the difference between the number of pebbles of color c in pile i and number of pebbles of color c in pile j is at most one.

In other words, let's say that bi, c is the number of pebbles of color c in the i-th pile. Then for any 1 ≤ c ≤ k, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n the following condition must be satisfied |bi, c - bj, c| ≤ 1. It isn't necessary to use all k colors: if color c hasn't been used in pile i, then bi, c is considered to be zero.

Input

The first line of the input contains positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100), separated by a space — the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.

The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.

Output

If there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output "NO" (without quotes) .

Otherwise in the first line output "YES" (without quotes). Then n lines should follow, the i-th of them should contain ai space-separated integers. j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ ai) of these integers should be equal to the color of the j-th pebble in the i-th pile. If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.

    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if abs(a[i] - a[i - 1]) > k:
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES')
    for i in a:
        tmp = 1
        for x in range(1, i + 1):
            if x > k:
                print(tmp, end=' ')
                tmp += 1
                if tmp > k:
                    tmp = 1
                continue
            print(x, end=' ')
        print()

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
