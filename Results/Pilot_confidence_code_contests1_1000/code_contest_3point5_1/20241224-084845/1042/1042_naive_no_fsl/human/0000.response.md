Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible result of the game described. It iteratively divides the current number of pebbles `n` into the smallest possible number of rows with more than one pebble per row, and sums these divisions until `n` becomes 1. This approach ensures that the number of pebbles in each step is maximized, leading to the maximum possible result. The program handles all cases within the given constraints, including both small and large values of `n`, and follows the problem description accurately.
