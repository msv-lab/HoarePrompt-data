You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Balph is learning to play a game called Buma. In this game, he is given a row of colored balls. He has to choose the color of one new ball and the place to insert it (between two balls, or to the left of all the balls, or to the right of all the balls).

When the ball is inserted the following happens repeatedly: if some segment of balls of the same color became longer as a result of a previous action and its length became at least 3, then all the balls of this segment are eliminated. 

Consider, for example, a row of balls 'AAABBBWWBB'. Suppose Balph chooses a ball of color 'W' and the place to insert it after the sixth ball, i. e. to the left of the two 'W's. After Balph inserts this ball, the balls of color 'W' are eliminated, since this segment was made longer and has length 3 now, so the row becomes 'AAABBBBB'. The balls of color 'B' are eliminated now, because the segment of balls of color 'B' became longer and has length 5 now. Thus, the row becomes 'AAA'. However, none of the balls are eliminated now, because there is no elongated segment.

Help Balph count the number of possible ways to choose a color of a new ball and a place to insert it that leads to the elimination of all the balls.

Input

The only line contains a non-empty string of uppercase English letters of length at most 3 â‹… 10^5. Each letter represents a ball with the corresponding color.

Output

Output the number of ways to choose a color and a position of a new ball in order to eliminate all the balls.

            lst = [i, 0]
        lst[-1] += 1
    all.append(lst)
    if len(all) & 1:
        l = r = len(all) >> 1
        if all[r][1] >= 2:
            ans = all[r][1] + 1
            l -= 1
            r += 1
            while l > -1:
                if all[l][0] != all[r][0] or all[l][1] + all[r][1] < 3:
                    ans = 0
                    break
                l -= 1
                r += 1
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
