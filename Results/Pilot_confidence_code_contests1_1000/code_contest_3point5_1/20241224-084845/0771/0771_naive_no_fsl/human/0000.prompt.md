You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel has several sticks with lengths equal to powers of two.

He has a_0 sticks of length 2^0 = 1, a_1 sticks of length 2^1 = 2, ..., a_{n-1} sticks of length 2^{n-1}. 

Pavel wants to make the maximum possible number of triangles using these sticks. The triangles should have strictly positive area, each stick can be used in at most one triangle.

It is forbidden to break sticks, and each triangle should consist of exactly three sticks.

Find the maximum possible number of triangles.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000) — the number of different lengths of sticks.

The second line contains n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the number of sticks with the length equal to 2^i.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of non-degenerate triangles that Pavel can make.

Examples

1 2 2 2 2

3 3 3


Output


3

Note

In the first example, Pavel can, for example, make this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): (2^0, 2^4, 2^4), (2^1, 2^3, 2^3), (2^1, 2^2, 2^2).

In the second example, Pavel cannot make a single triangle.

In the third example, Pavel can, for example, create this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): (2^0, 2^0, 2^0), (2^1, 2^1, 2^1), (2^2, 2^2, 2^2).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
