Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the most efficient way to free the required memory involves removing both types of applications (those with `b_i = 1` and `b_i = 2`). Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function assumes that it can always preferentially remove high-value applications (`b_i = 2`) before low-value ones (`b_i = 1`), which is not necessarily true.

Consider the following example:
- `n = 4`, `m = 10`
- `a = [5, 3, 2, 3]`
- `b = [1, 2, 1, 2]`

In this case, the optimal solution would be to remove applications with indices 1 and 3 (both with `b_i = 1`), freeing 7 units of memory and losing 2 convenience points. However, the current implementation might incorrectly try to remove high-value applications first, potentially missing this optimal solution.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed to explore all possible combinations of removing applications, considering both types together. This could involve dynamic programming or a more exhaustive search method.
