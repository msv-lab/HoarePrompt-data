Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the addition and subtraction of weights. Specifically, the program only checks for the existence of a weight in the `team` set before adding a new weight, but it does not ensure that all possible weights within the range are considered. This means the program may miss some valid combinations of weights that could result in a larger team.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
1 1 1 3 3 3
```

The program's output for this input would be 6, because it tries to add each weight directly or by Â±1 without considering if intermediate weights are missing. However, the correct solution should account for the fact that weights can overlap, and we need to find the longest sequence of unique weights. In this case, we can form a team with weights 1, 2, 3, which is only 3 members, not 6.

A correct approach would involve using a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to ensure all gaps are filled and the maximum number of unique weights is counted. The current implementation fails to handle such cases properly.
