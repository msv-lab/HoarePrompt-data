Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest possible expression value. The issue lies in how the maximum digit `m` is determined and used in the conversion process. 

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

For the input `1 1`, the program should output `2` because the sum `1 + 1` is `2`, and the longest representation in any valid base would be `2` (for base 3 and above). However, the program incorrectly calculates the length.

Let's walk through the steps for the input `1 1`:
1. The input is split into `a = '1'` and `b = '1'`.
2. `s = '11'`.
3. The maximum digit `m` is `1`.
4. The sum `t = 1 + 1 = 2`.
5. The program attempts to convert `2` to a string representation using base `m + 1 = 2`. The result is `2`, and the length is `1`.

The program should handle cases where the sum of `a` and `b` might require a larger base to fit all digits. This is not properly accounted for in the current implementation.
