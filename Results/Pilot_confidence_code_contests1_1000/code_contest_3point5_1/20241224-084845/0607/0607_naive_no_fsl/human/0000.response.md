Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains some logical issues that may lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the way the `midway` and `last` arrays are updated and used might not always correctly track the participant with the highest number of smelt.

Consider the following example:

```
3 5
1 4
2 5
1 3
3 6
2 7
```

- After the first event (`1 4`), participant 1 has 4 smelt.
- After the second event (`2 5`), participant 2 has 5 smelt.
- After the third event (`1 3`), participant 1 has 7 smelt.
- After the fourth event (`3 6`), participant 3 has 6 smelt.
- After the fifth event (`2 7`), participant 2 has 12 smelt.

Expected output:
```
1 4
2 5
1 7
1 7
2 12
```

However, the provided code might not handle the updates correctly due to the way the `midway` and `last` arrays are managed. This could lead to incorrect tracking of the participant with the highest number of smelt, especially when dealing with large numbers of events and participants.

To ensure correctness, a more straightforward approach might be needed, such as maintaining a dictionary to keep track of the smelt count for each participant and directly finding the maximum value and corresponding key after each event.
