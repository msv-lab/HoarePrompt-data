Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and the initial positions of the pieces.
2. **Sorting Positions**: The positions of the pieces are sorted before processing, which helps in calculating the minimum moves needed.
3. **Calculating Moves to Black Cells**: The program calculates the minimum moves required to place all pieces on black cells.
4. **Calculating Moves to White Cells**: Similarly, it calculates the minimum moves required to place all pieces on white cells.
5. **Finding Minimum Moves**: The program finds the minimum of the two calculated moves and prints it.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to handle all cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that the program does not address properly. Therefore, the program is correct.
