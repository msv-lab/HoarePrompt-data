Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest possible `a` does not exist within the given constraints. Specifically, the function `func_9()` uses binary search to find the smallest prime `p[j]` such that `p[j] - p[i] >= d`. However, if no such pair exists, the program will not handle this scenario correctly.

For example, consider the test case where `d = 10000`. In this case, the smallest possible `a` would be the product of the two smallest primes greater than \( \sqrt{2 \times 10000} = 200 \), which are 201 and 202. Since 201 is not a prime number, we need to check the next pair of primes, which are 223 and 227. The product of these primes is 50621, which has more than 4 divisors and satisfies the condition that the difference between any two divisors is at least 10000.

However, the current implementation of `func_9()` does not account for this scenario. It assumes that such a pair of primes will always exist and does not handle the case where no such pair exists. This means that for some values of `d`, the program may fail to produce the correct output.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the smallest possible `a` exists and handle the case where no such pair of primes exists.
