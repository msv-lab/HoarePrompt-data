Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not initialize the velocity components (`vx` and `vy`) correctly. The `Turtle` class initializes `vx` and `vy` to 0, which means the normalization function has no effect because the velocity is always 0. As a result, the `move` function does not change the position of the turtle, and the rotation function also does not affect the direction since the velocity is always 0. This leads to the turtle staying at the origin (0, 0) regardless of the inputs provided.

To fix this, the initial values of `vx` and `vy` should be set to 1 (or any non-zero value) in the `__init__` method to ensure proper movement and rotation.
