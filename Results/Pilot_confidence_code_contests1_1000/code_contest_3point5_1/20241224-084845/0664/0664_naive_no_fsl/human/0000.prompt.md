You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three integers x, y and n. Your task is to find the maximum integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n that k mod x = y, where mod is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.

In other words, with given x, y and n you need to find the maximum possible integer from 0 to n that has the remainder y modulo x.

You have to answer t independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such k exists for each test case.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The next t lines contain test cases.

The only line of the test case contains three integers x, y and n (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9;~ 0 ≤ y < x;~ y ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

It can be shown that such k always exists under the given constraints.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — maximum non-negative integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n and k mod x = y. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

Example

Input


7
7 5 12345
5 0 4
10 5 15
17 8 54321
499999993 9 1000000000
10 5 187
2 0 999999999


Output


12339
0
15
54306
999999995
185
999999998

Note

In the first test case of the example, the answer is 12339 = 7 ⋅ 1762 + 5 (thus, 12339 mod 7 = 5). It is obvious that there is no greater integer not exceeding 12345 which has the remainder 5 modulo 7.
Program:
```
def func():
    l = []
    for i in range(int(raw_input())):
        (x, y, n) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if n < x:
            l.append(0)
        else:
            a = n // x * x
            if a + y > n:
                l.append(a - (x - y))
            else:
                l.append(a + y)
    for j in l:
        print(j)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
