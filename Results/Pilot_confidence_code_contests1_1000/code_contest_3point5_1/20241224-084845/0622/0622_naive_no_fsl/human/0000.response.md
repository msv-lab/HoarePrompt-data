Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to check if making the matrix "good" is even possible, and it does not properly account for all edge cases, especially when `min(n, m) >= 4`.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Case where the matrix cannot be made good:**
   - Consider a 4x4 matrix with all zeros. According to the problem description, this matrix cannot be made good because every 2x2 sub-matrix will always have an even number of ones (0 in this case).
   - The program should output `-1` in such a case, but it does not perform this check.

2. **Case where the matrix can be made good:**
   - For smaller matrices, the program attempts to transform the matrix into a good one using dynamic programming. However, it does not ensure that the transformation is valid for all possible configurations of the matrix.
   - The program uses a bitmask approach to represent different states of the first row and updates these states iteratively. However, it does not guarantee that the resulting matrix will meet the requirement for all even-length square sub-matrices.

### Example:
For the input:
```
4 4
0000
0000
0000
0000
```
The correct output should be `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make the matrix good. However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and may produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not validate whether it is possible to make the matrix good and does not handle all edge cases properly.
