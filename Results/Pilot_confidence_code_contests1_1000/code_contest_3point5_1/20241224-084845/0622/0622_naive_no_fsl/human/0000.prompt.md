You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary matrix is called good if every even length square sub-matrix has an odd number of ones. 

Given a binary matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change to make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all. 

All the terms above have their usual meanings — refer to the Notes section for their formal definitions. 

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^6 and n⋅ m ≤ 10^6) — the number of rows and columns in a, respectively. 

The following n lines each contain m characters, each of which is one of 0 and 1. If the j-th character on the i-th line is 1, then a_{i,j} = 1. Similarly, if the j-th character on the i-th line is 0, then a_{i,j} = 0.

Output

Output the minimum number of cells you need to change to make a good, or output -1 if it's not possible at all.

Output


-1

Note

In the first case, changing a_{1,1} to 0 and a_{2,2} to 1 is enough. 

You can verify that there is no way to make the matrix in the second case good. 

Some definitions — 

  * A binary matrix is one in which every element is either 1 or 0. 
  * A sub-matrix is described by 4 parameters — r_1, r_2, c_1, and c_2; here, 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ n and 1 ≤ c_1 ≤ c_2 ≤ m. 
  * This sub-matrix contains all elements a_{i,j} that satisfy both r_1 ≤ i ≤ r_2 and c_1 ≤ j ≤ c_2. 
  * A sub-matrix is, further, called an even length square if r_2-r_1 = c_2-c_1 and r_2-r_1+1 is divisible by 2. 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
xor = lambda x, y: sum([x[i] != y[i] for i in range(m)])
Max = 10 ** 6 + 2
(n, m) = rints()
mat = [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
if min(n, m) >= 4:
    print(-1)
elif min(n, m) == 1:
    print(0)
else:
    if m > n:
        mat = [[mat[j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        (n, m) = (m, n)
    mem = [[Max for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(n)]
    bits = ['0' * m] + ['0' * (m - i.bit_length()) + bin(i)[2:] for i in range(1, 1 << m)]
    d = {0: [2, 5], 1: [3, 4], 2: [0, 7], 3: [1, 6], 4: [1, 6], 5: [0, 7], 6: [3, 4], 7: [2, 5]}
    if m == 2:
        d = {0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 3], 2: [0, 3], 3: [1, 2]}
    for i in range(1 << m):
        mem[0][i] = xor(bits[i], mat[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1 << m):
            mem[i][j] = min(mem[i - 1][d[j][0]], mem[i - 1][d[j][1]]) + xor(mat[i], bits[j])
    print(min(mem[-1]))

def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, m):
        val = int(x[i - 1]) + int(x[i]) + int(y[i - 1]) + int(y[i])
        if val % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
