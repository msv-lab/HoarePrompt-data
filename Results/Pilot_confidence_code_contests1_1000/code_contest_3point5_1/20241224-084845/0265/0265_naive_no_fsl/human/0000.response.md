Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input number consists only of the digit 0. For example, consider the input `0`. The program should output `0` and `0`, but the current implementation will fail because it involves complex calculations and digit manipulations that do not account for this specific edge case. Specifically, the loop and logic for calculating the maximum number of trailing zeros will not work correctly when the input is `0`.
