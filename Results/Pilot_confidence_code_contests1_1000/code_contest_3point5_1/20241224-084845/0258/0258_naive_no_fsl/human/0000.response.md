Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no 'a' characters in the string. In such a scenario, the result should be 0, but the current implementation will output `res - 1` % mod, which will be non-zero. For example, if the input is "bbbb", the program will output a non-zero value instead of 0.
