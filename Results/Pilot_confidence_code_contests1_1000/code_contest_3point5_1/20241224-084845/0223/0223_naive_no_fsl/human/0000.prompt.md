You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alica and Bob are playing a game.

Initially they have a binary string s consisting of only characters 0 and 1.

Alice and Bob make alternating moves: Alice makes the first move, Bob makes the second move, Alice makes the third one, and so on. During each move, the current player must choose two different adjacent characters of string s and delete them. For example, if s = 1011001 then the following moves are possible: 

  1. delete s_1 and s_2: 1011001 → 11001; 
  2. delete s_2 and s_3: 1011001 → 11001; 
  3. delete s_4 and s_5: 1011001 → 10101; 
  4. delete s_6 and s_7: 1011001 → 10110. 



If a player can't make any move, they lose. Both players play optimally. You have to determine if Alice can win.

Input

First line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Only line of each test case contains one string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), consisting of only characters 0 and 1.

Output

For each test case print answer in the single line.

If Alice can win print DA (YES in Russian) in any register. Otherwise print NET (NO in Russian) in any register.

Example

Input


3
01
1111
0011


Output


DA
NET
NET

Note

In the first test case after Alice's move string s become empty and Bob can not make any move.

In the second test case Alice can not make any move initially.

In the third test case after Alice's move string s turn into 01. Then, after Bob's move string s become empty and Alice can not make any move.
Program:
```
s5 = []
for t in range(int(raw_input())):
    s = raw_input()
    a = str(s)
    s5.append(a)
for t1 in s5:
    print(t1)

def func_1(s):
    s3 = list(s)
    i = 1
    j = 0
    s1 = ''
    while i < len(s3):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            s3.pop(i)
            s3.pop(i - 1)
            s = s1.join(s3)
            j += 1
            i = 0
        else:
            i += 1
            continue
        i += 1
    if j == 0 or j % 2 == 0:
        w = 'NET'
    else:
        w = 'DA'
    return w


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
