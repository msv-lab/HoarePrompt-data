Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the game turns alternately between Alice and Bob. Instead, it simply removes pairs of adjacent different characters from the string until no such pairs exist. This means it doesn't account for the alternating moves and the fact that a player can only make a move if there are valid pairs to remove.

For example, consider the input "0011":
- According to the problem description, Alice should be able to win because she can remove "01" first, leaving "01". Then Bob has no valid move since there are no adjacent different characters left.
- However, the provided program will incorrectly handle this case. It will not alternate between players and will instead focus on removing pairs of different characters, which does not reflect the alternating move nature of the game.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the game with alternating turns and check who can make a move at each step.
