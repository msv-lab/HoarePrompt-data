Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum average temperature. Specifically, the variable `cur_max` is used to store the maximum sum of temperatures for each segment of length `i`, but it should instead be used to store the maximum average temperature for each segment. Additionally, the division operation to calculate the average should be performed within the inner loop to ensure the correct average is calculated for each segment.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_avg = 0
    for i in range(k, n + 1):
        cur_sum = sum(arr[:i])
        cur_avg = cur_sum / float(i)
        max_avg = max(max_avg, cur_avg)
        for j in range(i, n):
            cur_sum = cur_sum - arr[j - i] + arr[j]
            cur_avg = cur_sum / float(i)
            max_avg = max(max_avg, cur_avg)
    print(max_avg)

func()
```

In the corrected version, the average is calculated directly using `cur_sum / float(i)` and updated in each iteration of the inner loop. This ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum average temperature over all segments of not less than `k` consecutive days.
