Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a switch that can be ignored while still turning on all the lamps. Specifically, the program checks if any lamp is turned on by exactly one switch, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The problem requires checking if there is any switch whose removal allows all lamps to still be turned on. The current implementation only checks if any lamp is toggled by exactly one switch, which is not a necessary condition. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4
1010
0110
0001
```

In this case, pressing all three switches turns on all four lamps. However, removing the third switch (which only turns on the fourth lamp) would leave the fourth lamp off. Therefore, the program should output "NO" for this case, but the current implementation will incorrectly output "YES" because it does not properly handle the scenario where multiple switches can turn on a single lamp.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there is any lamp that is not turned on by any of the remaining \( n-1 \) switches if one specific switch is removed. This requires a more comprehensive check of each switch's impact on the lamps.
