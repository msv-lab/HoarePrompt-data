Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the two strings equal. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of matching characters from the end of the strings and adds twice the count to the result, which does not accurately reflect the minimum number of moves needed.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
test
yes
```

Expected output:
```
7
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
```

This is because the program compares the strings from the end and counts the matching characters, but it should actually compare the strings from the beginning and count the non-matching characters to determine the minimum number of moves.

A correct approach would involve comparing the strings character by character from the start and counting the total number of characters that do not match until one of the strings is fully consumed. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    t = input().strip()
    N, M = len(s), len(t)
    i = 0
    while i < min(N, M) and s[i] == t[i]:
        i += 1
    ret = N + M - 2 * i
    print(ret)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through the strings from the start, skipping matching characters, and then calculates the total number of moves required by subtracting twice the number of matching characters from the sum of the lengths of the strings.
