Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the given problem. The issue lies in how the midpoint condition is checked. Specifically, the program uses a set to store potential midpoints but does not correctly handle the coordinate values. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `2` because there are two valid groups: ((1,1), (2,2), (3,3)) and ((2,2), (3,3), (4,4)).

Additionally, the program incorrectly combines the x and y coordinates into a single value using `10000 * (x + 1000) + y + 1000`, which may lead to collisions for different points with the same combined value. This approach does not guarantee that the midpoints are correctly identified.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to compare each pair of points directly to check if the midpoint exists among the remaining points.
