Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to use a union-find data structure to manage the merging of components, but there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**: The `func_2` function updates the parent pointers and sizes incorrectly. Specifically, the sizes are updated without ensuring they reflect the correct component size after the union operation. This can lead to incorrect merging and ultimately affect the final result.

2. **Logic Flaw in Main Loop**: The main loop processes the cards and attempts to merge components using `func_1` and `func_2`. However, the logic for selecting the maximum value from each row and column is flawed. It does not ensure that the maximum value is selected from each row and column independently and efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
(N, H, W) = map(int, input().split())

cards = [(0, 0, 0)] * (H + W)
for _ in range(N):
    (r, c, a) = map(int, input().split())
    cards[r - 1] = max(cards[r - 1], (a, r - 1, c + W - 1))
    cards[c + W - 1] = max(cards[c + W - 1], (a, r - 1, c + W - 1))

max_sum = 0
row_taken = set()
col_taken = set()

for i in range(H):
    if cards[i][1] not in row_taken:
        max_sum += cards[i][0]
        row_taken.add(cards[i][1])

for j in range(W):
    if cards[j + W][2] not in col_taken:
        max_sum += cards[j + W][0]
        col_taken.add(cards[j + W][2])

print(max_sum)
```

This corrected version directly processes the cards and ensures that the maximum value is selected from each row and column independently. It avoids the union-find overhead and ensures the correct selection logic.
