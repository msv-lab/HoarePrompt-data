You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A PIN code is a string that consists of exactly 4 digits. Examples of possible PIN codes: 7013, 0000 and 0990. Please note that the PIN code can begin with any digit, even with 0.

Polycarp has n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) bank cards, the PIN code of the i-th card is p_i.

Polycarp has recently read a recommendation that it is better to set different PIN codes on different cards. Thus he wants to change the minimal number of digits in the PIN codes of his cards so that all n codes would become different.

Formally, in one step, Polycarp picks i-th card (1 ≤ i ≤ n), then in its PIN code p_i selects one position (from 1 to 4), and changes the digit in this position to any other. He needs to change the minimum number of digits so that all PIN codes become different.

Polycarp quickly solved this problem. Can you solve it?

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.

The first line of each of t test sets contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the number of Polycarp's bank cards. The next n lines contain the PIN codes p_1, p_2, ..., p_n — one per line. The length of each of them is 4. All PIN codes consist of digits only.

Output

Print the answers to t test sets. The answer to each set should consist of a n + 1 lines

In the first line print k — the least number of changes to make all PIN codes different. In the next n lines output the changed PIN codes in the order corresponding to their appearance in the input. If there are several optimal answers, print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
