Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program reads inputs from stdin, which is not aligned with the problem description that specifies the input should be read from a file. Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. However, the main issue is that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make string `a` equal to string `b` by swapping characters between `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The program checks if for each position `j`, `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`. If this condition is true for any position, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making `a` and `b` equal through the allowed swaps.

A correct implementation would involve checking if for each character in `a` and `b`, there exists a corresponding character in `c` that can be swapped to make `a` and `b` equal. The given program fails to handle this correctly.
