You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.

For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i ↔ a_i or c_i ↔ b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).

For example, if a is "code", b is "true", and c is "help", you can make c equal to "crue" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "hodp" and b becomes "tele".

Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters a.

The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters b.

The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters c.

It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding 100.

Output

Print t lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:

If it is possible to make string a equal to string b print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.

Example

Input


4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim


Output


NO
YES
YES
NO

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.

In the second test case, you should swap c_i with a_i for all possible i. After the swaps a becomes "bca", b becomes "bca" and c becomes "abc". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the third test case, you should swap c_1 with a_1, c_2 with b_2, c_3 with b_3 and c_4 with a_4. Then string a becomes "baba", string b becomes "baba" and string c becomes "abab". Here the strings a and b are equal.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string a becomes exactly the same as string b.
Program:
```
import math
import heapq
import sys

def func():
    num = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(num):
        a = raw_input()
        b = raw_input()
        c = raw_input()
        f = 0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if b[j] != c[j] and a[j] != c[j]:
                f = 1
                break
        if f == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
