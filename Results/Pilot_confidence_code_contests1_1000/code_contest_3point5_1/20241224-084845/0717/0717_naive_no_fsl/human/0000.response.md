Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of green balloons (`g`) is less than the number of red balloons (`r`), but more than zero. Specifically, when `g < r`, the program incorrectly assumes that all green balloons can be paired with red balloons, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum number of tables that can be decorated.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- We have 3 red, 2 green, and 3 blue balloons.
- We can form 2 tables with the following combinations: "rgr", "rbg".
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of tables as 1 because it subtracts `r` from `g` and then performs the division by 3, leading to an incorrect result.

Actual Output (from the provided code):
```
1
```

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the case where `g < r`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
