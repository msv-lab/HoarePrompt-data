Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones in the pile is less than the maximum number of stones removed. According to the problem description, the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. However, the program does not account for the initial number of stones, which can be less than the maximum number of stones removed.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
---
```

The program output is `0`, but according to the problem description, the initial number of stones must be at least 3 to ensure the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking one stone. Therefore, the minimal possible number of stones after the operations should be `0`, but the program does not consider the initial number of stones, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the initial number of stones, ensuring it is at least the maximum number of stones removed plus the net increase in stones due to additions.
