You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input

The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s_i is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, s_i is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Note

In the first test, if Vasya had 3 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 0. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is 0. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than 3, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 4. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making 4 operations the number of stones in the pile increases on 4 stones. So, the answer is 4.

In the third test, if Vasya had 1 stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 1. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 3.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
