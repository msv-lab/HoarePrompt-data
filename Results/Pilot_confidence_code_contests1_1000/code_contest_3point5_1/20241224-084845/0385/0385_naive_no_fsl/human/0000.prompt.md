You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: During the research on properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers, Ildar, a famous mathematician, introduced a brand new concept of the weakened common divisor (WCD) of a list of pairs of integers.

For a given list of pairs of integers (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) their WCD is arbitrary integer greater than 1, such that it divides at least one element in each pair. WCD may not exist for some lists.

For example, if the list looks like [(12, 15), (25, 18), (10, 24)], then their WCD can be equal to 2, 3, 5 or 6 (each of these numbers is strictly greater than 1 and divides at least one number in each pair).

You're currently pursuing your PhD degree under Ildar's mentorship, and that's why this problem was delegated to you. Your task is to calculate WCD efficiently.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150 000) — the number of pairs.

Each of the next n lines contains two integer values a_i, b_i (2 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the WCD of the set of pairs. 

If there are multiple possible answers, output any; if there is no answer, print -1.

Examples

Input

3
17 18
15 24
12 15


Output

6

Input

2
10 16
7 17


Output

-1


Input

5
90 108
45 105
75 40
165 175
33 30


Output

5

Note

In the first example the answer is 6 since it divides 18 from the first pair, 24 from the second and 12 from the third ones. Note that other valid answers will also be accepted.

In the second example there are no integers greater than 1 satisfying the conditions.

In the third example one of the possible answers is 5. Note that, for example, 15 is also allowed, but it's not necessary to maximize the output.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin,stdout
from sets import Set

n = int(stdin.readline())
a = []
for i in range(n):
    x = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    a.append(x)
spf = func_1(20000000)
s1 = func_2(spf, a[0][0])
s2 = func_2(spf, a[0][1])
for i in s1:
    s2[i] = 1
flag = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if len(s2) == 0:
        flag = 0
        break
    else:
        kata = {}
        for j in s2:
            if j <= a[i][0] and a[i][0] % j == 0:
                kata[j] = 1
            if j <= a[i][1] and a[i][1] % j == 0:
                kata[j] = 1
        s2 = kata
if flag == 1 and len(s2) >= 1:
    for i in s2:
        stdout.write(str(i))
        break
else:
    stdout.write(str(-1))

def func_1(max_num):
    newp = []
    max_num += 1
    prime = [0] * max_num
    for i in range(2, max_num):
        if prime[i] == 0:
            for j in range(i * i, max_num, i):
                prime[j] = i
    for i in range(2, max_num):
        if prime[i] == 0:
            newp.append(i)
    return newp

def func_2(spf, x):
    s = {}
    for i in spf:
        if i <= x:
            if x % i == 0:
                s[i] = 1
        else:
            break
    s[x] = 1
    return s

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
