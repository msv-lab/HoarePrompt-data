Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the WCD for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Use of `Set` and Dictionary Operations**: The program uses a set-like structure to store prime factors but incorrectly updates the set of prime factors. Specifically, the way `s2` is updated and checked for valid prime factors is flawed. The current implementation may incorrectly remove or fail to retain valid prime factors.

2. **Potential Overlooking of Valid Factors**: The program checks divisibility and updates the set `s2` based on the current pair. However, it does not properly handle the intersection of valid factors across all pairs. For instance, if a factor is present in the first pair but not in subsequent pairs, it should still be considered valid if it exists in any pair.

3. **Lack of Proper Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where the GCD of individual pairs might not lead to a valid WCD. For example, consider the pairs (2, 3) and (5, 7). The GCD of individual elements in these pairs is 1, but the WCD could be 1 if no common divisor greater than 1 exists across the pairs.

Hereâ€™s a specific counterexample that the program fails to handle correctly:
- **Input**:
  ```
  2
  2 3
  5 7
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  -1
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  The program would output a value instead of -1, as it does not properly check for the absence of a valid WCD.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
