Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the wall can be completed using horizontal bricks.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
6
2 1 1 2 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

The issue arises because the program incorrectly checks if the maximum height `h` is greater than the last element in the `res` list. It should instead check if it is possible to make all elements in the list equal by using horizontal bricks. Here's a brief analysis of why the current implementation fails:

1. The program initializes an empty list `res`.
2. It iterates through the input array `arr` and appends elements to `res` if they are different from the last element.
3. If the last element is less than the maximum height `h`, it prints "NO".
4. If `res` has more than one element, it prints "NO".
5. If `res` is empty, it prints "YES".

This logic does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by placing horizontal bricks between equal elements. For example, in the input `[2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, Vova can place a horizontal brick between the two `2`s to make the wall `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]` and then another brick between the `2` and `3` to make the entire wall uniform.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all elements in the list can be made equal by placing horizontal bricks between adjacent equal elements.
