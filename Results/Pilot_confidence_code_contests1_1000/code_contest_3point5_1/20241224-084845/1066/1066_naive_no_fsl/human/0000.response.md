Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for handling cases where there are multiple avengers in the same position. Specifically, the program treats each position independently, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem states that "each position can be occupied by many avengers, but one avenger can occupy only one position." However, the program does not account for the fact that multiple avengers in the same position should be treated as a single entity.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:

Input:
```
2 2 1 2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: Since both avengers are in the same position (1), burning this position should take `B * n_a * l = 2 * 2 * 1 = 4` power. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the power as if there were two separate avengers, leading to an incorrect result.

The correct implementation should group avengers at the same positions and treat them as a single unit when calculating the power required to destroy the base.
