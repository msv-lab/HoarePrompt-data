You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and a positive integer m. It is guaranteed that m is a divisor of n.

In a single move, you can choose any position i between 1 and n and increase a_i by 1.

Let's calculate c_r (0 ≤ r ≤ m-1) — the number of elements having remainder r when divided by m. In other words, for each remainder, let's find the number of corresponding elements in a with that remainder.

Your task is to change the array in such a way that c_0 = c_1 = ... = c_{m-1} = n/m.

Find the minimum number of moves to satisfy the above requirement.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ n). It is guaranteed that m is a divisor of n.

The second line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array.

Output

In the first line, print a single integer — the minimum number of moves required to satisfy the following condition: for each remainder from 0 to m - 1, the number of elements of the array having this remainder equals n/m.

In the second line, print any array satisfying the condition and can be obtained from the given array with the minimum number of moves. The values of the elements of the resulting array must not exceed 10^{18}.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
