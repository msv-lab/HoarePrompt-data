Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the initial array already satisfies the condition \(c_0 = c_1 = \ldots = c_{m-1} = \frac{n}{m}\). In such a scenario, the program incorrectly computes a non-zero cost, which results in unnecessary changes to the array.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
4 2
0 1 2 3
```

For this input, the initial array already satisfies the condition \(c_0 = 2\) and \(c_1 = 2\). Therefore, no moves are needed. However, the program will still output a non-zero cost and make unnecessary changes to the array, such as:

```
Output:
0
0 1 2 3
```

Although the output is correct, the cost computation is unnecessary and indicates a potential bug in the logic. This behavior violates the requirement to compute the minimum number of moves required to satisfy the condition, and it may mislead users about the actual cost needed. Hence, the program is not fully correct.
