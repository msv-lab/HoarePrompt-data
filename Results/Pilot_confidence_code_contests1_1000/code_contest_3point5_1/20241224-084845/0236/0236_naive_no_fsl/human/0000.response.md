Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of "o" cards is zero and the number of "x" cards is more than one. Specifically, the program logic fails to handle this scenario correctly. 

Consider the following input:
```
0 4
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
-16
xxxx
```

However, the program will produce an incorrect output. The relevant part of the program logic is:
```python
if not a or not b:
    stdout.write(str(a * a - b * b) + '\n')
    stdout.write('o' * a + 'x' * b)
    return
```

This block handles the case where `a` or `b` is zero. However, when `a` is zero and `b` is greater than zero, it incorrectly calculates the score and constructs the string. The program should directly output `-16` and `xxxx` but instead, it might produce some other incorrect output due to the way the logic is structured.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where there are only "x" cards.
