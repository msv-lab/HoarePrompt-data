Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are some cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. **Example where the program fails to handle the correct number of shifts**: Consider the input `4` followed by the sequence `3 1 2 4`. The correct answer should be `3`, but the program will output `-1`.

2. **Example where the program fails to handle the correct detection of sorting**: Consider the input `3` followed by the sequence `1 3 2`. The program incorrectly outputs `-1`, but the correct answer should be `-1` because no series of shifts can sort the sequence.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Correctly identify the point where the sequence breaks the non-decreasing order.
- Ensure that the number of shifts needed to sort the sequence is calculated accurately.
- Handle cases where it is impossible to sort the sequence with unit shifts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_index = None
    max_index = -1
    
    # Find the first index where the sequence breaks the non-decreasing order
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            if min_index is None:
                min_index = i + 1
            max_index = i + 1
    
    # Check if it's possible to sort the sequence
    if min_index is None:
        print(0)
    elif a[max_index:] + a[:max_index] == sorted(a):
        print(n - max_index)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected program properly identifies the minimum number of shifts required to sort the sequence or determines if it's impossible to do so.
