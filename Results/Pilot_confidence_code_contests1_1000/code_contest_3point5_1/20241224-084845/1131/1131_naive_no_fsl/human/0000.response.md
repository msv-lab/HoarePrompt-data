Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of destroying boundary blocks. According to the problem description, an internal block must have all four sides (top, left, down, and right) adjacent to another block or the floor. However, the program incorrectly assumes that the height of the boundary block is determined by the minimum of the heights of its neighboring blocks plus one. This approach does not accurately reflect the process of destroying boundary blocks.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3 3 1 3 3
```

The program's output would be `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the correct process:

1. Initial state:
   ```
   3 3 1 3 3
   ```
2. After the first operation, the boundary blocks are removed:
   ```
   3 1 3
   ```
3. After the second operation, the remaining boundary blocks are removed:
   ```
   3
   ```
4. After the third operation, the last block is removed.

The program fails to correctly simulate this process, as it does not properly handle the reduction of the height of the middle tower to `1` after the first operation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
