You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of hi identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample.

Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed.

Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time.

Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n space-separated integers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 ≤ hi ≤ 109) — sizes of towers.

Output

Print the number of operations needed to destroy all towers.

Examples

Input

6
2 1 4 6 2 2


Output

3


Input

7
3 3 3 1 3 3 3


Output

2

Note

The picture below shows all three operations for the first sample test. Each time boundary blocks are marked with red color. 

<image> After first operation there are four blocks left and only one remains after second operation. This last block is destroyed in third operation.
Program:
```
from math import *
from Queue import *
from sys import *
from random import *

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    h = map(int, raw_input().split())
    l = [0 for i in range(n)]
    r = [0 for i in range(n)]
    l[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        l[i] = min(l[i - 1] + 1, h[i])
    r[-1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        r[i] = min(r[i + 1] + 1, h[i])
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, min(l[i], r[i]))
    print(res)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
