You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Scrooge, a very busy man, decided to count the time he wastes on all sorts of useless stuff to evaluate the lost profit. He has already counted the time he wastes sleeping and eating. And now Mr. Scrooge wants to count the time he has wasted signing papers.

Mr. Scrooge's signature can be represented as a polyline A1A2... An. Scrooge signs like that: first it places a pen at the point A1, then draws a segment from point A1 to point A2, then he draws a segment from point A2 to point A3 and so on to point An, where he stops signing and takes the pen off the paper. At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style. As Scrooge makes the signature, he never takes the pen off the paper and his writing speed is constant — 50 millimeters per second.

Scrooge signed exactly k papers throughout his life and all those signatures look the same.

Find the total time Scrooge wasted signing the papers.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000). Each of the following n lines contains the coordinates of the polyline's endpoints. The i-th one contains coordinates of the point Ai — integers xi and yi, separated by a space.

All points Ai are different. The absolute value of all coordinates does not exceed 20. The coordinates are measured in millimeters.

Output

Print one real number — the total time Scrooges wastes on signing the papers in seconds. The absolute or relative error should not exceed 10 - 6.

    k = input()
    x = input()
    y = input()
    n = n - 1
    for i in range(0, n):
        z = input()
        l = input()
        t += func_1(x, y, z, l)
        x = z
        y = l
    print(t * k) / 50.0

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
