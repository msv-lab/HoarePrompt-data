Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the described functionality:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` instead of `int(input())` or `map(int, input().split())` to read integer inputs. This will cause errors if the inputs are not correctly formatted as integers.

2. **Missing Import Statement**: The `sqrt` function from the `math` module is used without importing the `math` module. This should be corrected to `from math import sqrt`.

3. **Logic Error in Loop**: The loop should iterate `n-1` times, but the initial value of `n` is read as a string and then decremented by 1. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not parsed correctly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Time**: The calculation of the total time is done incorrectly. The sum of distances should be calculated before multiplying by `k` and dividing by 50. The current implementation attempts to multiply `k` and divide by 50 within the loop, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)

n, k = map(int, input().split())
x, y = map(int, input().split())

total_distance = 0
for _ in range(n - 1):
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    total_distance += func_1(x, y, x2, y2)
    x, y = x2, y2

print(total_distance * k / 50.0)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program reads inputs correctly, calculates the total distance properly, and multiplies it by `k` and divides by 50 outside the loop.
