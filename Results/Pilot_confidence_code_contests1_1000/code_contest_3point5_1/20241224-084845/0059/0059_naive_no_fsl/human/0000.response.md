Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program counts the number of games where the host team wears the guest uniform, but it does not account for the special case where the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform color. This means that for any pair of teams where the home uniform color of the host team matches the guest uniform color of the visiting team, the program will not increment the count `otv`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2
2 4
3 1
```

- Team 1 (home uniform: 1, guest uniform: 2) vs Team 3 (home uniform: 3, guest uniform: 1): Here, the home uniform color of Team 3 (3) matches the guest uniform color of Team 1 (1), so Team 3 should wear its guest uniform (4). However, the program will not count this game because it only compares the home uniform of the host team with the guest uniform of the visiting team without considering the reverse condition.

The correct implementation should check for both conditions (home uniform of host matches guest uniform of visitor and vice versa) to ensure the program works for all cases as described in the problem statement.
