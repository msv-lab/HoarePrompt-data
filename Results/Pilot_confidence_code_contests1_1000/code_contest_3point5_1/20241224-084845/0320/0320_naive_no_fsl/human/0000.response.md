Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that the product of the numbers in the first set is negative, the product of the numbers in the second set is positive, and the product of the numbers in the third set is zero, while also ensuring that each number appears in exactly one set.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-1 -2 -3 0
```

The program outputs:
```
2 -1 -2
1 -3
1 0
```

However, this output does not satisfy the condition that the product of the numbers in the first set must be negative. In this case, the product of the numbers in the first set (-1 * -2 = 2) is positive, which violates the requirement.

To correct this, the program needs to ensure that the first set contains exactly one negative number (to make its product negative), and the remaining numbers should be distributed between the other two sets to satisfy the given conditions.
