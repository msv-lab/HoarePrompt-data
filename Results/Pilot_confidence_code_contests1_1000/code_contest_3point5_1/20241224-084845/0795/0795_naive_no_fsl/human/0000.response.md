Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to cut a part of the fence so that the remaining fence remains good. Specifically, the calculation of `result` and `left_boundary` does not accurately reflect the conditions required for the remaining fence to be good after the cut.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
3 4 2
```

According to the problem description, the possible ways to cut the fence are as follows:
- Cut between the first and second boards: The heights become 3, 3, and the new maximum height is 3 (since 3 <= 4 - 1).
- Cut between the second and third boards: The heights become 4, 2, and the new maximum height is 2 (since 2 <= 3 - 1).

The program should calculate these possibilities correctly. However, the current implementation does not account for these scenarios properly, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the output for the given example should be 13, but the program outputs an incorrect value due to the flawed logic in calculating the valid cuts.
