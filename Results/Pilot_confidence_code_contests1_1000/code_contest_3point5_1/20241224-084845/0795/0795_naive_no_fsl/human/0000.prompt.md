You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long ago, Vasily built a good fence at his country house. Vasily calls a fence good, if it is a series of n consecutively fastened vertical boards of centimeter width, the height of each in centimeters is a positive integer. The house owner remembers that the height of the i-th board to the left is hi.

Today Vasily decided to change the design of the fence he had built, by cutting his top connected part so that the fence remained good. The cut part should consist of only the upper parts of the boards, while the adjacent parts must be interconnected (share a non-zero length before cutting out of the fence).

You, as Vasily's curious neighbor, will count the number of possible ways to cut exactly one part as is described above. Two ways to cut a part are called distinct, if for the remaining fences there is such i, that the height of the i-th boards vary.

As Vasily's fence can be very high and long, get the remainder after dividing the required number of ways by 1 000 000 007 (109 + 7).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of boards in Vasily's fence.

The second line contains n space-separated numbers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 ≤ hi ≤ 109), where hi equals the height of the i-th board to the left.

Output

Print the remainder after dividing r by 1 000 000 007, where r is the number of ways to cut exactly one connected part so that the part consisted of the upper parts of the boards and the remaining fence was good.

Note

From the fence from the first example it is impossible to cut exactly one piece so as the remaining fence was good.

All the possible variants of the resulting fence from the second sample look as follows (the grey shows the cut out part):

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
    N = int(lines[0])
    h_vec = [int(i) for i in lines[1].split(' ')]
    h_vec.append(0)
    R = 1000000007
    summ = 0
    prev = 0
    for i in xrange(N - 1, 0, -1):
        result = min(h_vec[i] - 1, h_vec[i - 1] - 1) + min(h_vec[i] - 1, h_vec[i - 1] - 1, h_vec[i + 1] - 1) * prev
        prev = result
        prev %= R
        left_boundary = min(h_vec[i - 1] - 1, h_vec[i] - 1)
        summ += left_boundary * result
        summ %= R
    single_sum = sum(h_vec) - N
    summ += single_sum
    summ %= R
    sys.stdout.write(str(summ))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
