Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the problem description accurately. It iterates through each test case, compares the red and blue numbers for each possible permutation of card orders, and determines whether Red, Blue, or if it's an equal chance. 

Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Digit Comparison**: For each test case, it compares the red and blue numbers for all permutations of the card orders. This is done by iterating over all possible permutations using `itertools.permutations`.
3. **Comparison Logic**: It counts the number of times the red number is greater than the blue number (`first`) and the number of times the blue number is greater than the red number (`second`).
4. **Output Determination**: Based on the counts, it prints whether Red, Blue, or the game is equal.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution handles all potential cases correctly. The program checks all permutations and ensures the logic for comparison is applied uniformly. Therefore, the program is correct.
