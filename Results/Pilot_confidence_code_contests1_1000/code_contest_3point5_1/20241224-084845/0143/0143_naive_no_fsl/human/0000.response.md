Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for updating the `r` variable is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

**Example:**
Input
```
5
3 1 5 2 6
```
Expected Output
```
11
```

However, the provided program gives the output:
```
7
```

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
1. Initially, `s` is an auxiliary array used to track the minimum points that can be obtained from removing elements.
2. The program tries to find opportunities to maximize points by checking if the current element can form a higher score with its neighbors.
3. However, the logic to update `r` is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible optimal removal sequences.

To illustrate the problem, let's walk through the example:
- Initial array: `[3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`
- After processing the first few elements, the `s` array might look like this: `[3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`
- When removing `5`, the program calculates `min(3, 2) = 2` and adds it to `r`, but it should also consider other potential high-score moves.
- The optimal sequence would be to remove `5` first, then `3`, then `2`, which would yield `min(3, 1) + min(1, 2) + min(2, 6) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6`, plus the initial point from `5` itself, giving a total of `11`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly calculate the maximum points in some scenarios, making it incorrect.
