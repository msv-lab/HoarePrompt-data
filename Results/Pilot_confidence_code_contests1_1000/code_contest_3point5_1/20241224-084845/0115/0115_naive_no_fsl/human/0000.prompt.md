You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Stepan likes to repeat vowel letters when he writes words. For example, instead of the word "pobeda" he can write "pobeeeedaaaaa".

Sergey does not like such behavior, so he wants to write a program to format the words written by Stepan. This program must combine all consecutive equal vowels to a single vowel. The vowel letters are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" and "y".

There are exceptions: if letters "e" or "o" repeat in a row exactly 2 times, like in words "feet" and "foot", the program must skip them and do not transform in one vowel. For example, the word "iiiimpleeemeentatiioon" must be converted to the word "implemeentatioon".

Sergey is very busy and asks you to help him and write the required program.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of letters in the word written by Stepan.

The second line contains the string s which has length that equals to n and contains only lowercase English letters — the word written by Stepan.

Output

Print the single string — the word written by Stepan converted according to the rules described in the statement.

Examples

Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input()
    s += '#'
    ans = []
    tmp = [s[0]]
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            if tmp[0] == 'a' or tmp[0] == 'e' or tmp[0] == 'i' or (tmp[0] == 'o') or (tmp[0] == 'u') or (tmp[0] == 'y'):
                if (tmp[0] == 'e' or tmp[0] == 'o') and len(tmp) == 2:
                    ans.extend(tmp)
                else:
                    ans.append(tmp[0])
            else:
                ans.extend(tmp)
            tmp = [s[i]]
        else:
            tmp.append(s[i])
    print(''.join(ans))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
