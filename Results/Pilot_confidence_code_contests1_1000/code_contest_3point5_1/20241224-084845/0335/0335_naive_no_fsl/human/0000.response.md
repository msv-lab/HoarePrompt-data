Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a letter appears in both the same row and column but is not repeated elsewhere in the row or column. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column, but it does not correctly update the matrix after marking the letter for removal, leading to potential false positives.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
aab
bcb
aba
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be `abc`, but the program will incorrectly output `abab`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why this happens:
1. The program reads the matrix and marks each letter in the matrix.
2. For the letter 'a' in the first row, the program checks its row and column and finds another 'a', so it marks it for removal.
3. Similarly, for the letter 'b' in the second row, the program checks its row and column and finds another 'b', so it marks it for removal.
4. However, for the letter 'a' in the third row, the program again checks its row and column and finds another 'a', so it marks it for removal, even though it was already marked in the first row.

This leads to the letter 'a' being counted twice, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should ensure that a letter is only marked for removal once, and it should not re-check already removed letters. One way to do this is to use a separate set to keep track of removed letters in each row and column.
