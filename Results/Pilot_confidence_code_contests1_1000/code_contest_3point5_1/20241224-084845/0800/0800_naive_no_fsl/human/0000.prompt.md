You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gleb ordered pizza home. When the courier delivered the pizza, he was very upset, because several pieces of sausage lay on the crust, and he does not really like the crust.

The pizza is a circle of radius r and center at the origin. Pizza consists of the main part — circle of radius r - d with center at the origin, and crust around the main part of the width d. Pieces of sausage are also circles. The radius of the i -th piece of the sausage is ri, and the center is given as a pair (xi, yi).

Gleb asks you to help determine the number of pieces of sausage caught on the crust. A piece of sausage got on the crust, if it completely lies on the crust.

Input

First string contains two integer numbers r and d (0 ≤ d < r ≤ 500) — the radius of pizza and the width of crust.

Next line contains one integer number n — the number of pieces of sausage (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Each of next n lines contains three integer numbers xi, yi and ri ( - 500 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 500, 0 ≤ ri ≤ 500), where xi and yi are coordinates of the center of i-th peace of sausage, ri — radius of i-th peace of sausage.

Output

Output the number of pieces of sausage that lay on the crust.

Note

Program:
```
def func():
    (rp, crust) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = int(raw_input())
    result = 0
    lower_bound = rp - crust
    upper_bound = rp
    lower_bound_sq = (rp - crust) ** 2
    upper_bound_sq = rp ** 2
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y, rs) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        ds = x * x + y * y
        if ds < lower_bound_sq or ds > upper_bound_sq:
            continue
        d_lower = int(ds ** 0.5)
        if d_lower ** 2 == ds:
            if d_lower - rs >= lower_bound and d_lower + rs <= upper_bound:
                result += 1
            continue
        l_estimate = 2 * rs * d_lower
        h_estimate = 2 * rs * d_lower + 1
        rs_sq = rs * rs
        if ds + rs_sq - l_estimate >= lower_bound_sq and ds + rs_sq + l_estimate <= upper_bound_sq:
            result += 1
    print(result)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
