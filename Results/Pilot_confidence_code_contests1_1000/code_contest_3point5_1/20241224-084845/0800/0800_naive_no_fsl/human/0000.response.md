Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where a piece of sausage is exactly on the boundary of the crust. Specifically, the program checks if `d_lower - rs >= lower_bound` and `d_lower + rs <= upper_bound`, but this condition does not account for the case where the piece of sausage is exactly on the boundary.

Consider the following test case:
```
8 4
1
0 0 4
```

In this case, the piece of sausage is exactly on the boundary of the crust. The program should count this piece, but it does not due to the condition check mentioned above.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the piece of sausage is on the boundary by considering the exact match condition more carefully.
