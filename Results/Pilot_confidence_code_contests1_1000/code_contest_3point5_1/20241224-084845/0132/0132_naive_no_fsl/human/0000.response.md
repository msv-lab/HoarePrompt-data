Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to output valid values for `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions when the input `X` is a prime number greater than 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
7
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 7
```

However, the provided program will fail to produce this output because it does not handle the case where `X` is a prime number greater than 2 correctly. The program logic is focused on finding factors of `X` and checking their properties, but it does not ensure that the output values `a` and `b` are chosen such that `max(a, b)` is minimized while maintaining the condition `LCM(a, b) == X`.

Since the program fails to work correctly for the input `7`, the overall correctness is **False**.
