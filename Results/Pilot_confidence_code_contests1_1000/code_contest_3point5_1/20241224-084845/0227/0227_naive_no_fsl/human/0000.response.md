Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not satisfy the condition `2 ∑ _{i = 1}^{n} |a_i - b_i| ≤ S` for all potential cases. Specifically, the program only ensures that the array `b` satisfies the divisibility condition but does not ensure the sum of absolute differences condition.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  1 2
  ```

- Expected output:
  A beautiful array `b` such that:
  - \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\)
  - For every pair of adjacent integers from the array, either \(b_i\) divides \(b_{i+1}\) or \(b_{i+1}\) divides \(b_i\).
  - \(2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - b_i| \leq S\)

- Actual output:
  ```
  1 2
  ```

In this case, the output array `[1, 2]` satisfies the divisibility condition, but the sum of absolute differences is \(2 \times (|1-1| + |2-2|) = 0\), which is trivially less than or equal to \(S = 3\). However, a better solution could be `[1, 1]` or `[2, 2]`, which would make the sum of absolute differences zero and thus meet the condition more effectively.

Since the program does not ensure that the sum of absolute differences is minimized while still satisfying the conditions, it fails to meet the requirement in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
