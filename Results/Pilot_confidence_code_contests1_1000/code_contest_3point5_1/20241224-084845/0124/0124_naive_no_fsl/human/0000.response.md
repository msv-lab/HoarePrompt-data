Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal but the parallelogram is not a rhombus because `a^2 + b^2 != c^2`. According to the problem description, a rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all four sides are equal. However, the current implementation increments the `diamond` counter whenever `a == b`, regardless of the value of `c`.

For example, consider the input:
```
4,4,6
```
In this case, `a == b` (both are 4), but since `4^2 + 4^2 != 6^2`, the parallelogram is not a rhombus. The program incorrectly counts this as a rhombus.

To fix this, the program should check both `a == b` and `a^2 + b^2 == c^2` to ensure it only counts true rhombuses.
