You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kalila and Dimna are two jackals living in a huge jungle. One day they decided to join a logging factory in order to make money. 

The manager of logging factory wants them to go to the jungle and cut n trees with heights a1, a2, ..., an. They bought a chain saw from a shop. Each time they use the chain saw on the tree number i, they can decrease the height of this tree by one unit. Each time that Kalila and Dimna use the chain saw, they need to recharge it. Cost of charging depends on the id of the trees which have been cut completely (a tree is cut completely if its height equal to 0). If the maximum id of a tree which has been cut completely is i (the tree that have height ai in the beginning), then the cost of charging the chain saw would be bi. If no tree is cut completely, Kalila and Dimna cannot charge the chain saw. The chainsaw is charged in the beginning. We know that for each i < j, ai < aj and bi > bj and also bn = 0 and a1 = 1. Kalila and Dimna want to cut all the trees completely, with minimum cost. 

They want you to help them! Will you?

Input

The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line of input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The third line of input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 109).

It's guaranteed that a1 = 1, bn = 0, a1 < a2 < ... < an and b1 > b2 > ... > bn.

Output

The only line of output must contain the minimum cost of cutting all the trees completely.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
