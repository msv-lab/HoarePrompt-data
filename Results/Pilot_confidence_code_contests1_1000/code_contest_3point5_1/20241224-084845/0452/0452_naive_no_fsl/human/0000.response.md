Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a different approach involving the `pt` class and dynamic programming techniques that do not align with the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to cut all trees completely using a chain saw, where the cost depends on the maximum ID of a completely cut tree.

The key issues are:
1. The `func_1` and `func_2` functions do not correctly calculate the minimum cost based on the given constraints.
2. The `pt` class and operations do not contribute to solving the problem as described.
3. The overall logic of the program does not match the problem requirements, as it does not properly handle the cost calculation for each tree based on the given conditions.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum cost to cut all trees completely, and thus it is incorrect.
