Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by both the customer and the clerk when making a payment for an item worth \( N \) using the available banknotes of values \( 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \ldots, 10^{(10^{100})} \).

The given program attempts to solve a different problem related to digit manipulation, which is evident from its logic and variable names. Specifically, the function `func_1` is trying to process digits of a number and perform some arithmetic operations, but it does not relate to the banknote problem at all.

For example, consider \( N = 100 \):
- According to the problem description, the optimal way to pay would be to give 100 (using one 100 banknote), and the clerk would give no change, resulting in a total of 1 banknote.
- However, the provided program would likely fail to produce the correct output because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
