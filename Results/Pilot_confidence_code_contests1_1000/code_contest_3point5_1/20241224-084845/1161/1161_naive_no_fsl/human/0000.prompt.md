You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given some Tetris field consisting of n columns. The initial height of the i-th column of the field is a_i blocks. On top of these columns you can place only figures of size 2 × 1 (i.e. the height of this figure is 2 blocks and the width of this figure is 1 block). Note that you cannot rotate these figures.

Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.

More formally, the problem can be described like this:

The following process occurs while at least one a_i is greater than 0:

  1. You place one figure 2 × 1 (choose some i from 1 to n and replace a_i with a_i + 2); 
  2. then, while all a_i are greater than zero, replace each a_i with a_i - 1. 



And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The next 2t lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of columns in the Tetris field. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a_i is the initial height of the i-th column of the Tetris field.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if you can clear the whole Tetris field and "NO" otherwise.

Example

Input


4
3
1 1 3
4
1 1 2 1
2
11 11
1
100


Output


YES
NO
YES
YES

Note

The first test case of the example field is shown below:

<image>

Gray lines are bounds of the Tetris field. Note that the field has no upper bound.

One of the correct answers is to first place the figure in the first column. Then after the second step of the process, the field becomes [2, 0, 2]. Then place the figure in the second column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes [0, 0, 0].

And the second test case of the example field is shown below:

<image>

It can be shown that you cannot do anything to end the process.

In the third test case of the example, you first place the figure in the second column after the second step of the process, the field becomes [0, 2]. Then place the figure in the first column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes [0, 0].

In the fourth test case of the example, place the figure in the first column, then the field becomes [102] after the first step of the process, and then the field becomes [0] after the second step of the process.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(n):
        columns = int(raw_input())
        blockColumn = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split(' ')]
        acc = 0
        allOdds = True
        doesntHaveZero = True
        for col in blockColumn:
            acc += col
            if col == 0:
                doesntHaveZero = False
            if col % 2 == 0:
                allOdds = False
        if n == 1 or acc == 0 or (allOdds and doesntHaveZero):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
