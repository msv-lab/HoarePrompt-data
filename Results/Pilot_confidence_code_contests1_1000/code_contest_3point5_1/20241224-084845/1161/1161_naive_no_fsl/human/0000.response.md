Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for the case where the total sum of the column heights is even and there is at least one column with an odd height. According to the problem description, if the total sum of the column heights is even and there is at least one column with an odd height, it is still possible to clear the field by strategically placing the figures. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 3 1
```

The program will output "NO", but according to the problem description, it should output "YES". Here's why:
- The total sum of the column heights is 5 (which is odd).
- There are two columns with odd heights (1 and 1).

By placing a figure in the first or the third column, we can reduce the heights as follows:
1. Place a figure in the first column: `[3, 3]`.
2. After the second step, the field becomes `[2, 2]`.
3. Place a figure in the second column: `[0, 0]`.

Thus, the field can be cleared, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

Another example to illustrate the issue:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program will also output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES". Here's why:
- The total sum of the column heights is 6 (which is even).
- All column heights are even.

We can clear the field by repeatedly placing figures and reducing the heights by 1 until all columns are cleared:
1. Place a figure in the first column: `[4, 2]`.
2. After the second step, the field becomes `[3, 1]`.
3. Place a figure in the second column: `[3, 3]`.
4. After the second step, the field becomes `[2, 2]`.
5. Place a figure in the first column: `[0, 2]`.
6. After the second step, the field becomes `[0, 0]`.

Therefore, the program fails to handle certain valid cases, making its correctness **False**.
