Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the required sum. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. The program calculates the sum of `s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1))` for each `i`, but this does not account for the maximum distance between all pairs of computers in each subset.

For instance, consider the second example provided:
- Input: `3`
- Coordinates: `4 3 1`

The correct output should be `9` as explained in the problem statement. However, the program will not produce this result because it does not correctly compute the maximum distance for each subset.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the maximum distance for each subset of computers and sum these values. The current implementation does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
