Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` is not used in the way intended by the problem description. The function `func_2` is defined to print values, but it is not utilized to compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the maximum bit length difference between consecutive elements in the array and ensure that we can cover all these differences within the minimum number of seconds. The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform this calculation correctly.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Iterate through the array and calculate the difference between consecutive elements.
2. Determine the maximum bit length of these differences.
3. This maximum bit length will be the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing.

The provided code does not perform steps 1 and 2 correctly, leading to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
