Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the input values do not satisfy the conditions \( x = \max(a, b) \), \( y = \max(a, c) \), and \( z = \max(b, c) \). 

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3 3
```

For this input, the program will output:
```
NO
```

However, a valid solution exists: \( a = 3 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = 3 \). Since the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
