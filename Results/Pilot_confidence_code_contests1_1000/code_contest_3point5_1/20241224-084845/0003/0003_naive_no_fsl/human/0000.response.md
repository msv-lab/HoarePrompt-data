Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the tree has more than one node with a degree greater than 2. Specifically, if a node has a degree of 2, the program incorrectly assumes it can achieve any configuration of real numbers on the edges through the given operations. However, this is not always true.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
```

In this case, node 1 has a degree of 3, which means it is not a leaf. The program does not check for this condition and will output "YES" for this input. However, it is not possible to achieve any arbitrary configuration of real numbers on the edges using the given operations since the operations can only affect paths between leaves.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all nodes with a degree greater than 1 are checked and handled appropriately. If any node with a degree greater than 1 exists, the program should output "NO".
