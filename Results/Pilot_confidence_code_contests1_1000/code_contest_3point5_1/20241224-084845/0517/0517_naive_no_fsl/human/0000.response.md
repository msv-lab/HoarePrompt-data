Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the permutation contains repeated elements that are not allowed according to the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that `P_i ≠ P_j` if `i ≠ j` and `P_i ≠ 0` and `P_j ≠ 0`. However, the program does not enforce this constraint and can still run without errors even if the input violates this rule. For example, if the input is:

```
4
0 2 2 0
```

This input is invalid because `P_2` and `P_3` are both 2, which violates the condition `P_i ≠ P_j` for `i ≠ j`. The program will still execute and produce an output, but the result will be incorrect because it does not account for this constraint.

Since the program does not handle the constraint correctly, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
