Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to count the number of divisions by 2, 3, and 5, but it does not account for the fact that the fox can only eat a fraction of the cheese that is divisible by these numbers. The function `func_1` returns the remaining value after division and the count of operations, but it does not ensure that the remaining values will eventually become equal.

For example, consider the input `14 8`. According to the problem description, the fox can only eat a fraction of the cheese that is divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what should happen:

1. The initial weights are 14 and 8.
2. The fox cannot eat from the 14-gram piece because it is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
3. The fox eats 2/3 of the 8-gram piece, leaving 8 * (1/3) = 8/3 â‰ˆ 2.67 grams.
4. The fox now eats 1/2 of the 14-gram piece, leaving 14 * (1/2) = 7 grams.
5. The fox then eats 1/2 of the 2.67-gram piece, leaving approximately 1.33 grams.
6. The fox eats 1/2 of the 7-gram piece, leaving 3.5 grams.
7. The fox continues to adjust the pieces until they are equal.

However, the provided program does not handle this logic correctly. It simply counts the number of divisions by 2, 3, and 5 without ensuring that the pieces will eventually become equal. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, particularly for the input `14 8`, where it outputs `-1` instead of the correct answer.
