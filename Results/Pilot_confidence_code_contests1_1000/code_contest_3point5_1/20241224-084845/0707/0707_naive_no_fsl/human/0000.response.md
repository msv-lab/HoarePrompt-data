Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating `ans_min` is incorrect. According to the problem, the minimum beauty can be achieved by summing all elements and then dividing by `x`, rounding up. However, the current implementation calculates the sum of individual elements divided by `x`, which is not equivalent to the minimum beauty.

A counterexample to show the program's incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
2 5
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2 6
```

The program incorrectly calculates `ans_min` as `2`, while the correct value should be `2` because the minimum beauty is achieved by summing all elements (1+2+3=6) and then dividing by 3, which is `2`.

To fix this, the calculation for `ans_min` should be:
```python
ans_min = (sum(lst) + x - 1) // x
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute both the minimum and maximum beauty for all test cases.
