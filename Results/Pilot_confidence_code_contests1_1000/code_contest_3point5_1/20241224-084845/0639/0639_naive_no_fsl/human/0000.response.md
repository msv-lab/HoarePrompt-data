Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the numbers in the interval [a, b] that are divisible by `k` but not by any number between 2 and `k-1`. Specifically, the `func_2` function seems to be attempting to count such numbers, but its implementation is flawed. 

Consider the following case:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 10`, `k = 7`

Expected output: Since `k = 7`, the numbers in the interval [1, 10] that are divisible by 7 but not by any number between 2 and 6 are 7. Hence, the expected output is `1`.

However, running the provided program with this input yields `0` because the `func_2` function does not correctly handle the logic to exclude numbers divisible by numbers between 2 and `k-1`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issue:
- The `func_2` function attempts to use a sieve-like approach to mark numbers that are multiples of primes up to `k-1`. However, the logic for counting the valid numbers (those divisible by `k` but not by numbers between 2 and `k-1`) is incorrect.
- The `dfs` function is used inappropriately and does not correctly count the desired numbers.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for this specific case, indicating it is incorrect.
