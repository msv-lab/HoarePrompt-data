Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of spiders and count the number of spiders Om Nom will see during his walk. Specifically, the program attempts to count spiders based on the initial positions and simple linear movements without considering the actual movement pattern of spiders over time.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 4
...
R.L
R.U
```

The expected output is:
```
0 2 2
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
0
0
0
```

This happens because the program does not properly simulate the movement of spiders. For instance, the spider at position (2, 1) moving left will eventually reach the boundary, but the program does not account for this and simply counts the initial positions.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the movement of each spider over time and track the number of spiders at each cell in each row. This involves iterating through each time step and updating the positions of the spiders accordingly.
