Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the shortest path calculation for Yura's journey home using Dijkstra's algorithm. It constructs the graph considering both direct moves between blocks and instant movements to locations sharing the same x or y coordinate. The program handles the adjacency matrix construction and the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation appropriately.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to cover all necessary cases. It calculates the minimum time required to reach the destination by considering both regular movement and instant movements. The program logic ensures that all possible paths are considered, and the minimum time is accurately computed.

Since the program correctly handles all tested cases and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
