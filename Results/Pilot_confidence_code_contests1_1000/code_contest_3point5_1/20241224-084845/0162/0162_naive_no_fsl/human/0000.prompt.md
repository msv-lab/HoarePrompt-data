You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long long ago, there was a thief. Looking for treasures, he was running about all over the world. One day, he heard a rumor that there were islands that had large amount of treasures, so he decided to head for there.

Finally he found n islands that had treasures and one island that had nothing. Most of islands had seashore and he can land only on an island which had nothing. He walked around the island and found that there was an old bridge between this island and each of all other n islands.

He tries to visit all islands one by one and pick all the treasures up. Since he is afraid to be stolen, he visits with bringing all treasures that he has picked up. He is a strong man and can bring all the treasures at a time, but the old bridges will break if he cross it with taking certain or more amount of treasures.

Please write a program that judges if he can collect all the treasures and can be back to the island where he land on by properly selecting an order of his visit.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 25

Input

Input consists of several datasets.

The first line of each dataset contains an integer n. Next n lines represents information of the islands. Each line has two integers, which means the amount of treasures of the island and the maximal amount that he can take when he crosses the bridge to the islands, respectively.

The end of input is represented by a case with n = 0.

Output

For each dataset, if he can collect all the treasures and can be back, print "Yes" Otherwise print "No"

Example

Input

3
2 3
3 6
1 2
3
2 3
3 5
1 2
0


Output

Yes
No
Program:
```
def func():
    while True:
        count_shima = input()
        if count_shima == 0:
            break
        A = []
        A = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for i in range(count_shima)]
        A.sort()
        weight = 0
        flag = True
        for (takara, turi) in A:
            weight += takara
            if turi < weight:
                flag = False
        print('Yes' if flag else 'No')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
