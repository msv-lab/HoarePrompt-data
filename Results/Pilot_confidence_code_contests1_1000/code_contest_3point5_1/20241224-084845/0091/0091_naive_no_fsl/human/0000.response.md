Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly addresses the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the input string `s` is of length 1. In such a case, the string itself is printed as a single substring since it cannot be divided further into two non-empty substrings.

2. **Unequal Count of Zeroes and Ones**: The program checks if the count of zeroes (`a`) and ones (`b`) in the string is unequal. If they are unequal, the entire string `s` is printed as a single substring because it is already good.

3. **Starting with '0'**: If the string starts with '0', it subtracts one from the count of zeroes. This adjustment ensures that the initial substring is good.

4. **Dividing into Substrings**: The program iterates through the string to find a point where the count of zeroes and ones becomes unequal. Once such a point is found, the string is split into two parts, and both parts are checked to ensure they are good. If the counts remain unequal after splitting, the program prints the two parts as separate substrings.

5. **Final Check**: The program ensures that the final substrings are good and that they cover the entire input string.

Given the examples provided and the logic implemented, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the minimal number of substrings are formed, and each substring is good. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
