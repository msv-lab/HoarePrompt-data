Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimal number of visible kangaroos. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where multiple kangaroos can potentially hold each other in a way that minimizes the number of visible kangaroos. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
8
9
1
6
2
6
5
8
3
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution should result in 5 visible kangaroos. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the optimal arrangement of kangaroos in the pockets. The program sorts the kangaroos and tries to place them in a way that minimizes visibility, but it does not ensure that the smallest kangaroo that can fit into another is placed optimally.

To verify this, let's manually check the expected output:

- The sorted list is: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9]`
- The smallest kangaroo (1) can fit into the second smallest (2), so we place 1 in 2's pocket.
- The next smallest (3) can fit into the next largest (5), so we place 3 in 5's pocket.
- The next smallest (6) can fit into the next largest (8), so we place 6 in 8's pocket.
- The last smallest (6) can fit into the largest (9), so we place 6 in 9's pocket.

Thus, the optimal arrangement would leave 5 kangaroos visible: `[9, 8, 6, 5, 1]`.

However, the current implementation does not guarantee this optimal arrangement. It simply sorts the kangaroos and tries to place them in a linear fashion, which may not always yield the minimum number of visible kangaroos. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
