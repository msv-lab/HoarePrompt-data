Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial balance after transactions can be negative and there are no further transactions to bring the balance back to non-negative. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 4
-10 0 20
```

According to the problem description, after the first transaction (-10), the balance would be -10. Since the next transaction checks the balance (when `ai = 0`), the balance should be non-negative, but it is -10. The program does not handle this scenario correctly and will output 0 instead of -1, indicating that it is impossible to meet the requirements without exceeding the limit or having a negative balance during a check. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
