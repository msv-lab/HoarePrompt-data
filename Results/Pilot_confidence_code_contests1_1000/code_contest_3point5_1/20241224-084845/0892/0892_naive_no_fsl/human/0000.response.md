Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program compares the frequency of each character in the two strings by sorting the lists of values from the character frequency dictionaries. However, this approach only checks if the frequency counts match, which is not sufficient to determine if the strings can be made equal through the allowed operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
azzel
apple
```

The program will output:
```
['a', 'l', 'z']
['a', 'e', 'p']
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
Yes
```

Although the frequencies of characters are the same, the strings cannot be made equal because they do not contain the same set of characters (e.g., 'a' appears twice in 'azzel' but once in 'apple').

A correct solution would involve checking if both strings contain the exact same set of characters and their counts, and also verifying if the strings can be transformed into each other by swapping characters as described. The current implementation does not account for these necessary checks, making it incorrect.
