Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of splitters is flawed.

Let's analyze the given examples and the provided code:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: We need 4 pipes with flowing water, and we have splitters with 2, 3, 4, ..., k outputs. With `k=3`, we can use a 3-output splitter to get 3 pipes, and a 2-output splitter to get the 4th pipe. This is correct.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: We need 5 pipes with flowing water, and we have splitters with 2, 3, 4, ..., k outputs. With `k=5`, we can use a 5-output splitter to get 5 pipes. This is correct.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `8 4`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: We need 8 pipes with flowing water, and we have splitters with 2, 3, 4, ..., k outputs. With `k=4`, we cannot form exactly 8 pipes using the available splitters. This is correct.

However, the provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. For instance, consider the following test case:

- **Test Case:**
  - Input: `10 6`
  - Expected Output: `3` (Using one 6-output splitter to get 6 pipes, one 4-output splitter to get 4 more pipes, and one additional pipe can be a direct connection from the initial water source.)
  - Actual Output: The code might not correctly calculate this scenario.

The lambda function `f(k, x)` and the loop logic do not accurately represent the possible combinations of splitters to achieve the exact number of pipes required. Therefore, the program is incorrect for some cases and does not always produce the correct minimum number of splitters.
