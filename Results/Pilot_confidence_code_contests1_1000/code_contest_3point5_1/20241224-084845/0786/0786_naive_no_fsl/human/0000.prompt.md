You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The tournament «Sleepyhead-2010» in the rapid falling asleep has just finished in Berland. n best participants from the country have participated in it. The tournament consists of games, each of them is a match between two participants. n·(n - 1) / 2 games were played during the tournament, and each participant had a match with each other participant. 

The rules of the game are quite simple — the participant who falls asleep first wins. The secretary made a record of each game in the form «xi yi», where xi and yi are the numbers of participants. The first number in each pair is a winner (i.e. xi is a winner and yi is a loser). There is no draws.

Recently researches form the «Institute Of Sleep» have found that every person is characterized by a value pj — the speed of falling asleep. The person who has lower speed wins. Every person has its own value pj, constant during the life. 

It is known that all participants of the tournament have distinct speeds of falling asleep. Also it was found that the secretary made records about all the games except one. You are to find the result of the missing game.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of participants. The following n·(n - 1) / 2 - 1 lines contain the results of the games. Each game is described in a single line by two integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi), where xi и yi are the numbers of the opponents in this game. It is known that during the tournament each of the n participants played n - 1 games, one game with each other participant.

Output

Output two integers x and y — the missing record. If there are several solutions, output any of them.

Program:

from math import *
from Queue import *

def func():
    m = [0 for i in range(51)]
    n = int(raw_input())
    results = []
    for i in range(n * (n - 1) / 2 - 1):
        l = map(int, raw_input().split())
        results.append((l[0], l[1]))
        m[l[0]] += 1
        m[l[1]] += 1
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if m[i] == n - 2:
            l.append(i)
    b = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (l[0], i) in results and (i, l[0]) in results:
            print(str(l[0]) + ' ' + str(l[1]))
            b = False
    if b:
        print(str(l[1]) + ' ' + str(l[0]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
