You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Vasya decided to have a look at the results of Berland 1910 Football Championship’s finals. Unfortunately he didn't find the overall score of the match; however, he got hold of a profound description of the match's process. On the whole there are n lines in that description each of which described one goal. Every goal was marked with the name of the team that had scored it. Help Vasya, learn the name of the team that won the finals. It is guaranteed that the match did not end in a tie.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of lines in the description. Then follow n lines — for each goal the names of the teams that scored it. The names are non-empty lines consisting of uppercase Latin letters whose lengths do not exceed 10 symbols. It is guaranteed that the match did not end in a tie and the description contains no more than two different teams.

Output

Print the name of the winning team. We remind you that in football the team that scores more goals is considered the winner.

    for i in range(0, n):
        s = raw_input()
        if not s in m:
            m[s] = 1
            k += 1
        else:
            m[s] += 1
        if maxi < m[s]:
            maxi = m[s]
            str = s
    print(s)
    sys.exit()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
