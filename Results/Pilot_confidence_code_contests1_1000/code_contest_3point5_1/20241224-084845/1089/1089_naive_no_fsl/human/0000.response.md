Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting airport `a` and the destination airport `b` belong to different companies and there is no intermediate airport with the same company as `a` to reduce the cost. 

Consider the following example:
```
Input:
4 1 4
0101

Output:
1
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

In this case, both airports 1 and 4 belong to different companies, but there is no intermediate airport with the same company as airport 1 (which is 0) to reduce the cost. The program calculates the cost as `4 - 1 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct solution would be to fly directly from airport 1 to airport 4 since they are the only airports belonging to different companies, making the cost 0.
