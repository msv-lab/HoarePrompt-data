You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The "BerCorp" company has got n employees. These employees can use m approved official languages for the formal correspondence. The languages are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For each employee we have the list of languages, which he knows. This list could be empty, i. e. an employee may know no official languages. But the employees are willing to learn any number of official languages, as long as the company pays their lessons. A study course in one language for one employee costs 1 berdollar.

Find the minimum sum of money the company needs to spend so as any employee could correspond to any other one (their correspondence can be indirect, i. e. other employees can help out translating).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of employees and the number of languages.

Then n lines follow — each employee's language list. At the beginning of the i-th line is integer ki (0 ≤ ki ≤ m) — the number of languages the i-th employee knows. Next, the i-th line contains ki integers — aij (1 ≤ aij ≤ m) — the identifiers of languages the i-th employee knows. It is guaranteed that all the identifiers in one list are distinct. Note that an employee may know zero languages.

The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum amount of money to pay so that in the end every employee could write a letter to every other one (other employees can help out translating).

Examples

3 1 2 3
1 1
2 5 4
2 6 7
1 3
2 7 4
1 1


Output

Input

2 2
1 2
0


Output

1

Note

In the second sample the employee 1 can learn language 2, and employee 8 can learn language 4.

In the third sample employee 2 must learn language 2.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin,stdout
from collections import defaultdict

(falantes, parent, rank, zeros) = (defaultdict(list), {}, {}, 0)
(n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
for i in xrange(1, n + 1):
    linguas = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if linguas[0] == '0':
        zeros += 1
    for j in linguas[1:]:
        falantes[j].append(i)
    func_1(i)
for i in falantes.values():
    for j in xrange(len(i) - 1):
        func_3(i[j], i[j + 1])
for filho in parent:
    parent[filho] = func_2(parent[filho])
if zeros != n:
    stdout.write(str(len(set(parent.values())) - 1))
else:
    stdout.write(str(len(set(parent.values())) + 1 - 1))

def func_1(a):
    parent[a] = a
    rank[a] = 1

def func_2(a):
    if a == parent[a]:
        return a
    parent[a] = func_2(parent[a])
    return parent[a]

def func_3(a, b):
    parentA = func_2(a)
    parentB = func_2(b)
    if parentA == parentB:
        return
    if rank[parentA] < rank[parentB]:
        parent[parentA] = parentB
        rank[parentB] += rank[parentA]
    else:
        parent[parentB] = parentA
        rank[parentA] += rank[parentB]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
