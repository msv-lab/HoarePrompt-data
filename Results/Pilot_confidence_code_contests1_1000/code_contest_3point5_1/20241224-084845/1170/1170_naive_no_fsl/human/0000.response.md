Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program sorts the books in descending order of their width and then iteratively adds books to the vertical stack until the condition `W <= T` is met. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum total thickness of the vertical books.

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution should place the two books with thickness 2 horizontally since their combined width (5) is less than or equal to the thickness of the book with thickness 1 (10). However, the program will place the book with thickness 1 vertically first, which is not optimal.

The correct approach would involve using a dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible ways to place the books to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books. The current implementation fails to explore all possible configurations and thus does not guarantee the minimum total thickness.
