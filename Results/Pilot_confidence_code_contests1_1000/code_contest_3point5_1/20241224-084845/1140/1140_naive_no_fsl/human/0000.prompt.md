You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima has a hamsters farm. Soon N hamsters will grow up on it and Dima will sell them in a city nearby.

Hamsters should be transported in boxes. If some box is not completely full, the hamsters in it are bored, that's why each box should be completely full with hamsters.

Dima can buy boxes at a factory. The factory produces boxes of K kinds, boxes of the i-th kind can contain in themselves ai hamsters. Dima can buy any amount of boxes, but he should buy boxes of only one kind to get a wholesale discount.

Of course, Dima would buy boxes in such a way that each box can be completely filled with hamsters and transported to the city. If there is no place for some hamsters, Dima will leave them on the farm.

Find out how many boxes and of which type should Dima buy to transport maximum number of hamsters.

Input

The first line contains two integers N and K (0 ≤ N ≤ 1018, 1 ≤ K ≤ 105) — the number of hamsters that will grow up on Dima's farm and the number of types of boxes that the factory produces.

The second line contains K integers a1, a2, ..., aK (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1018 for all i) — the capacities of boxes.

Output

Output two integers: the type of boxes that Dima should buy and the number of boxes of that type Dima should buy. Types of boxes are numbered from 1 to K in the order they are given in input.

If there are many correct answers, output any of them.

    idx = 1
    lasteq = math.floor(n / a[0] * 1.0) * a[0]
    for i in range(1, k):
        eq = math.floor(n / a[i] * 1.0) * a[i]
        if eq > lasteq:
            lasteq = eq
            mx = n / a[i]
            idx = i + 1
        elif eq == lasteq:
            b1 = n / a[i]
            if b1 < mx:
                mx = b1
                idx = i + 1
    print('%d %d' % (idx, mx))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
