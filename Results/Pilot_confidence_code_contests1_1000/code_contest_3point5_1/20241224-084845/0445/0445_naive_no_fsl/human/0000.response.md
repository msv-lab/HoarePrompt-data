Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the array `a` has repeated elements and requires multiple arrays `b_i` to satisfy the conditions.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```

According to the problem description, the minimum possible value of `m` should be 2 because we can split the array into two arrays `b_1` and `b_2` as follows:
- `b_1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `b_2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

However, the current implementation calculates `max(1, func_14(cnt, k - 1))`, which will always give 1 for `k > 1` when `cnt` is non-zero. This is incorrect because it does not account for the requirement that the number of different elements in each array `b_i` should be at most `k`.

To fix this, the code needs to consider the number of unique elements in the array `a` and ensure that the solution involves splitting the elements into `b_i` arrays while respecting the constraints. The current approach only considers the count of changes in the array `a` and does not properly handle the distribution of unique elements across the `b_i` arrays.
