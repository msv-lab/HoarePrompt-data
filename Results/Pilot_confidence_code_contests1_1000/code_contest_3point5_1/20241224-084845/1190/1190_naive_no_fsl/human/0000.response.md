Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the leap year rules. Specifically, the expression `leap_year = [not y % 4 and y % 100 or not y % 400 for y in range(3001)]` is flawed. This expression does not properly handle the leap year conditions. 

For instance, consider the year 1900:
- It is divisible by 4, so `y % 4 == 0`.
- It is also divisible by 100, so `y % 100 == 0`.
- It is not divisible by 400, so `y % 400 != 0`.

According to the leap year rules, 1900 should not be a leap year. However, the expression `not y % 4 and y % 100 or not y % 400` will evaluate to `False and True or False`, which simplifies to `False`. This means 1900 would be incorrectly marked as a leap year.

To fix this, the leap year check should be implemented using proper conditional logic:

```python
def func_1(readline=stdin.readline):
    def is_leap_year(y):
        return y % 4 == 0 and (y % 100 != 0 or y % 400 == 0)

    separator = ''
    while True:
        (a, b) = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        if not a and not b:
            break
        print(separator, end='')
        result = 'NA\n'
        for year in range(a, b + 1):
            if is_leap_year(year):
                print(year)
                result = ''
        print(result, end='')
        separator = '\n'
```

This corrected version uses a function `is_leap_year` to properly check if a year is a leap year according to the specified rules.
