Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the special case for the letter "n" correctly. According to the problem description, after the letter "n", any letter (including another consonant) or no letter at all is allowed. However, the current implementation will set `p` to `False` if "n" is followed by a consonant, which is incorrect. For example, the word "nbo" should be considered Berlanese, but the program incorrectly classifies it as non-Berlanese because it checks the letter immediately following "n" without considering subsequent characters.
