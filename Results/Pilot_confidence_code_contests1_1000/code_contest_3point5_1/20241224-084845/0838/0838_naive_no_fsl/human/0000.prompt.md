You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob begin their day with a quick game. They first choose a starting number X0 ≥ 3 and try to reach one million by the process described below. 

Alice goes first and then they take alternating turns. In the i-th turn, the player whose turn it is selects a prime number smaller than the current number, and announces the smallest multiple of this prime number that is not smaller than the current number.

Formally, he or she selects a prime p < Xi - 1 and then finds the minimum Xi ≥ Xi - 1 such that p divides Xi. Note that if the selected prime p already divides Xi - 1, then the number does not change.

Eve has witnessed the state of the game after two turns. Given X2, help her determine what is the smallest possible starting number X0. Note that the players don't necessarily play optimally. You should consider all possible game evolutions.

Input

The input contains a single integer X2 (4 ≤ X2 ≤ 106). It is guaranteed that the integer X2 is composite, that is, is not prime.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum possible X0.

Examples

Input

14


Output

6


Input

20


Output

15


Input

8192


Output

8191

Note

In the first test, the smallest possible starting number is X0 = 6. One possible course of the game is as follows: 

  * Alice picks prime 5 and announces X1 = 10
  * Bob picks prime 7 and announces X2 = 14. 



In the second case, let X0 = 15. 

  * Alice picks prime 2 and announces X1 = 16
  * Bob picks prime 5 and announces X2 = 20. 
Program:
```
import sys
from math import ceil

primes = func_1(1000001)
x2 = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
primes = [i for (i, p) in enumerate(primes) if p == True and i <= x2 + 1]
print(func_2(x2))

def func_1(limit):
    a = [True] * limit
    a[0] = a[1] = False
    for (i, isprime) in enumerate(a):
        if isprime:
            for n in range(i * i, limit, i):
                a[n] = False
    return a

def func_2(x2):
    x1s = set([])
    for p in primes:
        if x2 % p:
            continue
        for x1 in range(x2 - p + 1, x2):
            x1s.add(x1)
    x1s = list(x1s)
    min_x0 = float('inf')
    for x1 in x1s[1000:]:
        for p in primes:
            if x1 % p:
                continue
            if x1 == p:
                if x1 < 3:
                    continue
                min_x0 = min(min_x0, x1)
            else:
                if x1 - p + 1 < 3:
                    continue
                min_x0 = min(min_x0, x1 - p + 1)
    return min_x0


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
