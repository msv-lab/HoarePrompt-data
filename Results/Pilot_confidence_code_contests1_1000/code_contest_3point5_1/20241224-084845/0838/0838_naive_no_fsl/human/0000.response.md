Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` is designed to find the smallest possible starting number \(X_0\) based on \(X_2\). However, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed and does not cover all necessary scenarios.

### Example Analysis:

Let's analyze the provided examples and the program's behavior:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: \(X_2 = 14\)
   - Output: \(X_0 = 6\)
   - Possible game evolution:
     - Alice chooses 5, so \(X_1 = 10\).
     - Bob chooses 7, so \(X_2 = 14\).
   - The program should find the smallest \(X_0\) that leads to this sequence. However, the program's current implementation might not cover all possible sequences correctly.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: \(X_2 = 20\)
   - Output: \(X_0 = 15\)
   - Possible game evolution:
     - Alice chooses 2, so \(X_1 = 16\).
     - Bob chooses 5, so \(X_2 = 20\).
   - The program should find the smallest \(X_0\) that leads to this sequence. Again, the program's current implementation might not cover all possible sequences correctly.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: \(X_2 = 8192\)
   - Output: \(X_0 = 8191\)
   - Possible game evolution:
     - Alice or Bob could choose a prime close to 8192, leading to \(X_2 = 8192\).
   - The program should find the smallest \(X_0\) that leads to this sequence. The current implementation might not handle large numbers correctly.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Prime Sieve**: The `func_1` function generates a boolean array indicating whether each number up to the limit is prime. This part is correct but is used inefficiently in `func_2`.

- **Inefficient Search for \(X_1\)**: The program tries to find \(X_1\) by iterating over a subset of primes and checking conditions. This approach is inefficient and might miss valid sequences.

- **Infinite Loop**: The nested loops in `func_2` might lead to infinite loops or unnecessary computations, especially for large \(X_2\).

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases like when \(X_2\) is very close to a prime number or when the sequence involves very small numbers.

Given these issues, the program does not cover all potential cases correctly and thus is **incorrect**.
