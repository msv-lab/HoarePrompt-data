You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This week Arkady wanted to cook some pancakes (to follow ancient traditions) and make a problem about that. But then he remembered that one can't make a problem about stacking pancakes without working at a specific IT company, so he decided to bake the Napoleon cake instead.

To bake a Napoleon cake, one has to bake n dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack, adding some cream. Arkady started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps n times: 

  * place a new cake layer on the top of the stack; 
  * after the i-th layer is placed, pour a_i units of cream on top of the stack. 



When x units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, top x layers of the cake get drenched in the cream. If there are less than x layers, all layers get drenched and the rest of the cream is wasted. If x = 0, no layer gets drenched.

<image> The picture represents the first test case of the example.

Help Arkady determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over, and which don't.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20 000). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of layers in the cake.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the amount of cream poured on the cake after adding each layer.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single line with n integers. The i-th of the integers should be equal to 1 if the i-th layer from the bottom gets drenched, and 0 otherwise.

    lst = [int(i) for i in lst]
    print(func_1(lst, layers))

def func_1(arr, layers):
    res = [0 for i in range(layers)]
    for a in range(0, len(arr)):
        if arr[a] == 0:
            continue
        res[a] += 1
        idx = a - arr[a]
        if idx > 0:
            res[idx] -= 1
    for i in range(len(res) - 2, -1, -1):
        res[i] += res[i + 1]
    lst = [str(1) if i >= 1 else str(0) for i in res]
    return ' '.join(lst)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
