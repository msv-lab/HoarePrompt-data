Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the fact that cream can only drench up to the top `x` layers, and if there are fewer than `x` layers, all remaining cream is wasted.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6
  0 3 0 0 1 3
  ```

According to the problem description:
1. Place the first layer, no cream is poured.
2. Place the second layer, pour 3 units of cream. The top 3 layers (layers 2, 3, and 4) get drenched.
3. Place the third layer, no cream is poured.
4. Place the fourth layer, no cream is poured.
5. Place the fifth layer, pour 1 unit of cream. The top 1 layer (layer 5) gets drenched.
6. Place the sixth layer, pour 3 units of cream. The top 3 layers (layers 6, 5, and 4) get drenched.

Expected output:
```
1 1 1 0 1 1
```

However, the current implementation of `func_1` will produce:
```
1 1 0 1 1 1
```

This is because the function incorrectly adds the drenching count without properly limiting it to the top `x` layers. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the case where the amount of cream poured exceeds the number of remaining layers.
