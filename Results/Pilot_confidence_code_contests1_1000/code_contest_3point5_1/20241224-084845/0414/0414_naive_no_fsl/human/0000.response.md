Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the last 15 minutes are all boring. According to the problem description, if there are 15 consecutive boring minutes, Limak will turn off the TV immediately after the 15th consecutive boring minute. However, the current implementation only checks up to minute 90 and prints 90 if no such sequence is found. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
70 80 90
```

In this case, minutes 71, 72, ..., 85 are all boring, but the program will not detect this and will incorrectly print 90. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
