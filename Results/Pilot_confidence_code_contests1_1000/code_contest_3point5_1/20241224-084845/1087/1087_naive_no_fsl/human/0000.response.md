Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input lengths can form a degenerate triangle but not a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program checks if the lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle using the `func_1` function. However, it does not explicitly check for the possibility of forming a degenerate triangle.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

Input:
```
6 6 3 3
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `SEGMENT` because it is possible to form a degenerate triangle with side lengths 6, 6, and 3 (where two sides are equal). However, the current implementation might not correctly identify this case. The program should first check if a degenerate triangle can be formed and only then proceed to check for a non-degenerate triangle. 

The current implementation only checks if a non-degenerate triangle can be formed, which means it might miss the case where a degenerate triangle can be formed but a non-degenerate one cannot. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
