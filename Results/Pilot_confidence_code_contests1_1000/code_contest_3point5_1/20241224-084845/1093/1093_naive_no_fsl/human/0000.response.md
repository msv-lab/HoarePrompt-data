Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the inner loop does not properly handle the case where multiple pairs of equal consecutive elements exist. The program only checks for and processes the leftmost pair, which may not always lead to the correct final sequence. For example, consider the input sequence `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. The program would incorrectly produce `[2, 2]` instead of the expected output `[3]`.

To fix this, the program needs to continue processing pairs until no more consecutive equal elements are found, ensuring that all possible pairs are processed in each iteration.
