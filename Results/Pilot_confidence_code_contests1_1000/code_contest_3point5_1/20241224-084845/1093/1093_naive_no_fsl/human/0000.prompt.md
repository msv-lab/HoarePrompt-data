You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

While possible, you perform the following operation: find a pair of equal consecutive elements. If there are more than one such pair, find the leftmost (with the smallest indices of elements). If the two integers are equal to x, delete both and insert a single integer x + 1 on their place. This way the number of elements in the sequence is decreased by 1 on each step. 

You stop performing the operation when there is no pair of equal consecutive elements.

For example, if the initial sequence is [5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2], then after the first operation you get [5, 2, 2, 2, 2], after the second — [5, 3, 2, 2], after the third — [5, 3, 3], and finally after the fourth you get [5, 4]. After that there are no equal consecutive elements left in the sequence, so you stop the process.

Determine the final sequence after you stop performing the operation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains the sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

In the first line print a single integer k — the number of elements in the sequence after you stop performing the operation. 

In the second line print k integers — the sequence after you stop performing the operation.

Note

The first example is described in the statements.

In the second example the initial sequence is [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]. After the first operation the sequence is equal to [1000000001, 1000000000, 1000000000]. After the second operation the sequence is [1000000001, 1000000001]. After the third operation the sequence is [1000000002].

In the third example there are no two equal consecutive elements initially, so the sequence does not change.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = []
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    j = 0
    t = 1
    while t == 1:
        t = 0
        a = b
        b = []
        j = 0
        while j < len(a) - 1:
            if a[j] == a[j + 1] and t != 1:
                b.append(a[j] + 1)
                j += 1
                t = 1
            else:
                b.append(a[j])
            j += 1
        if j < len(a):
            b.append(a[j])
    st = ''
    for bb in b:
        st += str(bb) + ' '
    print(st)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
