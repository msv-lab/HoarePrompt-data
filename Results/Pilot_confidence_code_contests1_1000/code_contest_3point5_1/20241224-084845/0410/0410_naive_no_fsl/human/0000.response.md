Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for certain cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not properly implemented to check if there is a path between `u` and `v` using edges of the same color. The function `func_1` is trying to traverse the graph but it is not correctly using the `edges` dictionary to find paths of the same color.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 5
1 2 1
1 2 2
2 3 1
2 3 3
2 4 3
3
1 2
3 4
1 4
```

The output should be:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the given program will produce incorrect results because it does not properly check for paths of the same color using the `edges` dictionary. The function `func_1` should use the `edges` dictionary to determine if there is a path between `u` and `v` using edges of the same color, but it currently does not do this correctly.

To fix this, the function `func_1` needs to use the `edges` dictionary to check for the existence of edges of the same color between nodes and recursively check for paths.
