You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
