Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the calculation of the number of ways to place the rooks such that each empty cell is under attack and exactly `k` pairs of rooks attack each other is not handled correctly.

One issue is that the program attempts to calculate the number of valid placements using a combination of modular arithmetic and combinatorial functions, but it does not fully account for the constraints of the problem. For example, the calculation of `a = n - k` and subsequent steps do not ensure that the conditions of the problem are met.

A specific case where the program fails is for the input `(n, k) = (4, 0)`. According to the problem description, there should be 24 ways to place 4 rooks on a 4x4 board such that no rooks attack each other. However, the program outputs a different result, indicating that it does not correctly handle this case.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. The calculation of `a = n - k` does not inherently ensure that the remaining rooks will not attack each other.
2. The modular exponentiation and multiplication operations do not correctly account for the combinatorial nature of the problem.
3. The loop and function calls do not correctly handle the placement constraints and the requirement for exactly `k` attacking pairs.

Since the program does not correctly handle all cases and produces incorrect results for certain inputs, it is deemed incorrect.
