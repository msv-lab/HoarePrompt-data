Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple cards have the same cost and you need to maximize the damage. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not explore all possible combinations of cards that can be played within the cost limit, especially when there are multiple cards with the same cost. This can lead to missing optimal solutions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 10
1 10
1 10
1 10
```

The correct output should be 40, as you can play all four cards to maximize the damage. However, the current implementation of `func_1` might not explore all combinations of these cards due to the way it processes the input and makes recursive calls, potentially missing the optimal solution.
