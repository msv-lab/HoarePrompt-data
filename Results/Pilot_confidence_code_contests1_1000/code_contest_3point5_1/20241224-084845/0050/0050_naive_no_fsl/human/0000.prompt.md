You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are playing a computer card game called Splay the Sire. Currently you are struggling to defeat the final boss of the game.

The boss battle consists of n turns. During each turn, you will get several cards. Each card has two parameters: its cost c_i and damage d_i. You may play some of your cards during each turn in some sequence (you choose the cards and the exact order they are played), as long as the total cost of the cards you play during the turn does not exceed 3. After playing some (possibly zero) cards, you end your turn, and all cards you didn't play are discarded. Note that you can use each card at most once.

Your character has also found an artifact that boosts the damage of some of your actions: every 10-th card you play deals double damage.

What is the maximum possible damage you can deal during n turns?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of turns.

Then n blocks of input follow, the i-th block representing the cards you get during the i-th turn.

Each block begins with a line containing one integer k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of cards you get during i-th turn. Then k_i lines follow, each containing two integers c_j and d_j (1 ≤ c_j ≤ 3, 1 ≤ d_j ≤ 10^9) — the parameters of the corresponding card.

It is guaranteed that ∑ _{i = 1}^{n} k_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum damage you may deal.

Output

Note

In the example test the best course of action is as follows:

During the first turn, play all three cards in any order and deal 18 damage.

During the second turn, play both cards and deal 7 damage.

During the third turn, play the first and the third card and deal 13 damage.

During the fourth turn, play the first and the third card and deal 25 damage.

During the fifth turn, play the only card, which will deal double damage (200).
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    result = 0
    played = 0
    for k in range(n):
        arr = []
        size = int(input())
        for _ in range(size):
            arr.append([int(i) for i in raw_input().split()])
        res = func_2(arr, played, (k + 1) % 5 == 0)
        result += res[0]
        played += res[1]
    print(result)

def func_1(numbers, target, _max, partial=[]):
    s = [0, 0]
    for i in range(len(partial)):
        s[0] += partial[i][0]
        s[1] += partial[i][1]
        if (i + 1 + _max[1]) % 10 == 0:
            s[1] += partial[i][1]
    if len(s) == 2:
        if s[0] <= target:
            if s[1] > _max[0]:
                _max[1] = len(partial)
                _max[0] = s[1]
        if s[0] > target:
            return
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        n = numbers[i]
        remaining = numbers[i + 1:]
        func_1(remaining, target, _max, partial + [n])

def func_2(l, played, is_double=False):
    _max = [0, played]
    func_1(l, 3, _max)
    return _max


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
