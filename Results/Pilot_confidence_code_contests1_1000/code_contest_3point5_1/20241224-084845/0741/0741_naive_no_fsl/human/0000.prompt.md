You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Toad Rash has a binary string s. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.

Let n be the length of s.

Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers l, r that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and there is at least one pair of integers x, k such that 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, l ≤ x < x + 2k ≤ r, and s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}.

Find this number of pairs for Rash.

Input

The first line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300 000), consisting of zeros and ones.

Output

Output one integer: the number of such pairs of integers l, r that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and there is at least one pair of integers x, k such that 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, l ≤ x < x + 2k ≤ r, and s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}.

Examples

Input


010101


Output


3


Input


11001100


Output


0

Note

In the first example, there are three l, r pairs we need to count: 1, 6; 2, 6; and 1, 5.

In the second example, there are no values x, k for the initial string, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
a = raw_input()
ans = 0
n = len(a)
for i in range(n):
    ans += n - func_1(i, n)
print(ans)

def func_1(k, n):
    x = n
    for i in range(k, k + 9):
        for j in range(1, 5):
            if i + 2 * j < n and a[i] == a[i + j] and (a[i + j] == a[i + 2 * j]):
                x = min(x, i + 2 * j)
    return x


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
