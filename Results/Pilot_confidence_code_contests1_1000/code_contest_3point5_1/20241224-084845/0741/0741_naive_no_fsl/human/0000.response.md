Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly checking for the required conditions. The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum value of `x` such that there exists a valid triplet `x, x+k, x+2k`, but it does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider the input `110110`. According to the problem description, the output should be 4 because there are four valid pairs of integers \(l, r\): (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 6), and (4, 6). However, the provided program will not correctly identify these pairs.

To illustrate, let's analyze the substring `110110`:

- For `i = 1`, the function `func_1` checks the substrings starting from positions 1 to 9 (with a maximum length of 18) and fails to correctly identify the valid triplets.
- Similarly, for other positions, the function does not correctly identify the valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
