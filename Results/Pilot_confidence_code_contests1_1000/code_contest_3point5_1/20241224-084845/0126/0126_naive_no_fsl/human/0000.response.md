Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to draw a chessboard as described. It uses a nested loop to iterate through each cell of the board and prints `#` or `.` based on whether the sum of the current row and column indices is even or odd. This ensures that the top-left corner starts with `#`, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the program handles all given constraints and examples correctly, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the program fails to handle, the program is correct.
