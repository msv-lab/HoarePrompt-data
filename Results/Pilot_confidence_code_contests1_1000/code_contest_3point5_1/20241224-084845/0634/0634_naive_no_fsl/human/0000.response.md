Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the constraints derived from the questions overlap in a way that makes no valid solution possible. Let's consider an example:

### Example Input:
```
3
> 1 Y
< 2 Y
>= 3 N
```

### Expected Output:
For this input, there is no integer \( y \) that satisfies both:
- \( y > 1 \)
- \( y < 2 \)
- \( y \geq 3 \)

However, the program will attempt to derive a range for \( y \) and may incorrectly conclude a solution exists. Here's how the program processes the input:

1. `> 1 Y` means \( y > 1 \).
2. `< 2 Y` means \( y < 2 \).
3. `>= 3 N` means \( y < 3 \).

From these, we can derive:
- \( 1 < y < 2 \) and \( y < 3 \).

Since \( y \) cannot simultaneously be greater than 1 and less than 2, there is no valid integer solution. However, the program will not detect this contradiction and may output an invalid value or "Impossible" incorrectly.

To fix this, the program needs to check for contradictions more rigorously and ensure that the ranges do not overlap in an impossible way. For instance, it could maintain a set of ranges and check for intersections or inconsistencies after processing all inputs.
