You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A TV show called "Guess a number!" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.

The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer y and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:

  * Is it true that y is strictly larger than number x? 
  * Is it true that y is strictly smaller than number x? 
  * Is it true that y is larger than or equal to number x? 
  * Is it true that y is smaller than or equal to number x? 



On each question the host answers truthfully, "yes" or "no".

Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of y that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print "Impossible".

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) — the number of questions (and answers). Next n lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: "sign x answer", where the sign is:

  * ">" (for the first type queries), 
  * "<" (for the second type queries), 
  * ">=" (for the third type queries), 
  * "<=" (for the fourth type queries). 



All values of x are integer and meet the inequation  - 109 ≤ x ≤ 109. The answer is an English letter "Y" (for "yes") or "N" (for "no").

Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.

Output

Print any of such integers y, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number y must meet the inequation  - 2·109 ≤ y ≤ 2·109. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word "Impossible" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

&gt;= 1 Y
&lt; 3 N
&lt;= -3 N
&gt; 55 N


Output

17


Input

2
&gt; 100 Y
&lt; -100 Y


Output

Impossible
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    l = sys.stdin.readlines()
    t = []
    for s in l[1:]:
        t.append(s.split())
    left = -1 * (2 * 10 ** 9)
    right = 2 * 10 ** 9
    for c in t:
        if c[2] == 'N':
            if c[0] == '>':
                c[0] = '<='
            elif c[0] == '<':
                c[0] = '>='
            elif c[0] == '>=':
                c[0] = '<'
            elif c[0] == '<=':
                c[0] = '>'
        if c[0] == '>':
            if int(c[1]) >= left:
                left = int(c[1]) + 1
        elif c[0] == '<':
            if int(c[1]) <= right:
                right = int(c[1]) - 1
        elif c[0] == '>=':
            if int(c[1]) > left:
                left = int(c[1])
        elif c[0] == '<=':
            if int(c[1]) < right:
                right = int(c[1])
        if left > right:
            print('Impossible')
            sys.exit(0)
    print(left)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
