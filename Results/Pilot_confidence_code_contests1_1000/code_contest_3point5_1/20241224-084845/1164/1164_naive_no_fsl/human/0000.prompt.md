You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

You have to construct two sequences of integers b and c with length n that satisfy:

  * for every i (1≤ i≤ n) b_i+c_i=a_i 
  * b is non-decreasing, which means that for every 1<i≤ n, b_i≥ b_{i-1} must hold 
  * c is non-increasing, which means that for every 1<i≤ n, c_i≤ c_{i-1} must hold 



You have to minimize max(b_i,c_i). In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences b and c.

Also there will be q changes, the i-th change is described by three integers l,r,x. You should add x to a_l,a_{l+1}, …, a_r. 

You have to find the minimum possible value of max(b_i,c_i) for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^5).

The secound line contains n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (1≤ i≤ n, -10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

The third line contains an integer q (1≤ q≤ 10^5).

Each of the next q lines contains three integers l,r,x (1≤ l≤ r≤ n,-10^9≤ x≤ 10^9), desribing the next change. 

Output

Print q+1 lines.

On the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ q+1) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after i-1 changes.

Note

In the first test:

  * The initial sequence a = (2, -1, 7, 3). Two sequences b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,-2) is a possible choice. 
  * After the first change a = (2, -4, 4, 0). Two sequences b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,-1,-1,-5) is a possible choice. 
  * After the second change a = (2, -4, 6, 2). Two sequences b=(-4,-4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,-4) is a possible choice.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
