Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. It calculates the sum of XOR operations between all pairs of integers modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Bitwise Calculation**: The program uses bitwise operations to count how many numbers have a 1 in each bit position. This is a common technique for solving problems involving XOR operations over all pairs.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles large numbers up to \(2^{60}\), which is within the constraints. It also handles the range of \(N\) from 2 to \(3 \times 10^5\).

4. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and processes it in the expected manner.

Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the provided solution seems to cover all necessary aspects and correctly implements the logic. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make this program incorrect based on the provided examples and the problem constraints.
