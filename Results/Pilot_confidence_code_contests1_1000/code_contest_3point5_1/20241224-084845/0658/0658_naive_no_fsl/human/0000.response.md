Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program tries to use a graph-based approach to solve the problem, but this approach is not aligned with the requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Graph Construction**: The graph construction part seems irrelevant to the problem. The edges are being added between nodes `j` and `j - i`, which doesn't directly address the requirement about rearranging characters based on prime indices.

2. **Prime Check Function**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime, but its usage within the graph construction and the overall logic is misplaced.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the program does not correctly rearrange the characters to meet the condition that for any prime number `p ≤ |s|` and for any integer `i` ranging from 1 to `|s| / p`, the condition `sp = sp × i` must hold. Instead, it attempts to construct a graph and then tries to perform a depth-first search (DFS), which is not relevant to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. For instance, consider the input `"abc"`. The correct output should be `"YES"` followed by any permutation of the string, but the current implementation does not produce a valid rearrangement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
