You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s, consisting of small Latin letters. Let's denote the length of the string as |s|. The characters in the string are numbered starting from 1. 

Your task is to find out if it is possible to rearrange characters in string s so that for any prime number p ≤ |s| and for any integer i ranging from 1 to |s| / p (inclusive) the following condition was fulfilled sp = sp × i. If the answer is positive, find one way to rearrange the characters.

Input

The only line contains the initial string s, consisting of small Latin letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is possible to rearrange the characters in the string so that the above-mentioned conditions were fulfilled, then print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes) and print on the second line one of the possible resulting strings. If such permutation is impossible to perform, then print the single string "NO".

Examples

Input

abc


Output

YES
abc


Input

abcd


Output

NO


Input

xxxyxxx


Output

YES
xxxxxxy

Note

In the first sample any of the six possible strings will do: "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab" or "cba".

In the second sample no letter permutation will satisfy the condition at p = 2 (s2 = s4).

In the third test any string where character "y" doesn't occupy positions 2, 3, 4, 6 will be valid.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
