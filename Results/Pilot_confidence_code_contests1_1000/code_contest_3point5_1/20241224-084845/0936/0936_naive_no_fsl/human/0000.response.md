Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all cases. Specifically:

1. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function `compare` is not defined in the provided code. Even though the comment mentions `a.sort(cmp=compare)`, the actual comparison function `compare` is missing. This will cause a runtime error.

2. **Weight Sum Limit**: The program checks if `wsum > 10000.0` but the problem constraints state that `1 \leq w_i, s_i \leq 10^4`. Therefore, `wsum` should not exceed 10000, but the check is unnecessary and potentially misleading.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1`, which is correct for memoization. However, the program should ensure that the base case and recursive calls handle all edge cases properly.

Here is a corrected version of the code with these issues addressed:

```python
import sys

n = int(input())
w = [0] * n
s = [0] * n
v = [0] * n

for i in range(n):
    w[i], s[i], v[i] = map(int, input().split())

a = sorted([(w[i], s[i], v[i]) for i in range(n)], key=lambda x: x[1])

w = [x[0] for x in a]
s = [x[1] for x in a]
v = [x[2] for x in a]

dp = [[-1] * (10001) for _ in range(n + 1)]

def func_2(i, wsum):
    if i == n:
        return 0
    if dp[i][wsum] != -1:
        return dp[i][wsum]
    
    ans = 0
    if s[i] >= wsum:
        ans = max(ans, v[i] + func_2(i + 1, wsum + w[i]))
    ans = max(ans, func_2(i + 1, wsum))
    
    dp[i][wsum] = ans
    return ans

print(func_2(0, 0))
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should now handle all potential cases correctly.
