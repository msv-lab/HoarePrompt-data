Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the `buildMaxHeap` algorithm based on the given pseudo code. It iterates from the last parent node (index `H/2`) to the root (index `0`) and calls `maxHeapify` to ensure the max-heap property is satisfied for each node. The `maxHeapify` function correctly identifies the largest child and swaps the parent with the largest child if necessary, then recursively applies the same process to the affected subtree.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for selecting the largest child and swapping nodes if needed is implemented accurately. The reverse loop starting from `func_3(size)` ensures that all parent nodes are processed, and the `maxHeapify` function is applied in a bottom-up manner, which is essential for constructing a valid max-heap. Given the input format and the operations performed, the program will correctly construct a max-heap for any valid input array of size `H`.
