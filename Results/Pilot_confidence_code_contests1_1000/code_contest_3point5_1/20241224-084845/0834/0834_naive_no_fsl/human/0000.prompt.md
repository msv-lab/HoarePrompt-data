You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Heidi has finally found the mythical Tree of Life – a legendary combinatorial structure which is said to contain a prophecy crucially needed to defeat the undead armies.

On the surface, the Tree of Life is just a regular undirected tree well-known from computer science. This means that it is a collection of n points (called vertices), some of which are connected using n - 1 line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by a path (a sequence of one or more edges).

To decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number of lifelines in the tree – these are paths of length 2, i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n – the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to n. Then n - 1 lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers a b – the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1 ≤ a < b ≤ n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.

Output

Print one integer – the number of lifelines in the tree.

Examples

Input

4
1 2
1 3
1 4


Output

3

Input

5
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5


Output

4

Note

In the second sample, there are four lifelines: paths between vertices 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 5.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    t = 0
    T = 0
    a = None
    b = None
    d = set()
    for line in sys.stdin:
        line = line.strip()
        if t == 0:
            T = int(line)
            a = [0] * (T + 1)
            b = [0] * (T + 1)
        elif line:
            (i, j) = [int(item) for item in line.split()]
            d.add((i, j))
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        else:
            break
        t += 1
    for (i, j) in d:
        b[j] += a[i]
        b[i] += a[j]
    print(sum(b) - sum(a)) / 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
