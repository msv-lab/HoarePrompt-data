Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the frequency of each character in the string `s` is not divisible by `k`. However, the problem description requires that the string can be rearranged to form a k-string, which means every character's frequency must be divisible by `k`. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3
abcabcabz
```

The program will output `-1`, but this is incorrect because a valid k-string can be formed by rearranging the string as `"abcabcabc"`, which is a 3-string. The program fails to recognize this and incorrectly outputs `-1` because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the string to meet the k-string requirement.
