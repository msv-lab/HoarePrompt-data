You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has an array a consisting of n integers.

He wants to play a game with this array. The game consists of several moves. On the first move he chooses any element and deletes it (after the first move the array contains n-1 elements). For each of the next moves he chooses any element with the only restriction: its parity should differ from the parity of the element deleted on the previous move. In other words, he alternates parities (even-odd-even-odd-... or odd-even-odd-even-...) of the removed elements. Polycarp stops if he can't make a move.

Formally: 

  * If it is the first move, he chooses any element and deletes it; 
  * If it is the second or any next move: 
    * if the last deleted element was odd, Polycarp chooses any even element and deletes it; 
    * if the last deleted element was even, Polycarp chooses any odd element and deletes it. 
  * If after some move Polycarp cannot make a move, the game ends. 



Polycarp's goal is to minimize the sum of non-deleted elements of the array after end of the game. If Polycarp can delete the whole array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero.

Help Polycarp find this value.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of elements of a.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible sum of non-deleted elements of the array after end of the game.

    for e in l:
        if e % 2 == 0:
            even = even + [e]
        else:
            odd = odd + [e]
    l1 = len(odd)
    l2 = len(even)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    ans = 0
    if len(even) > len(odd):
        temp = len(even) - len(odd)
        ans = sum(even[0:temp - 1])
    if len(even) < len(odd):
        temp = -len(even) + len(odd)
        ans = sum(odd[0:temp - 1])
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
