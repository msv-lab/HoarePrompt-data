Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly determine whether a quadrilateral has a dent. The logic in the `func_1` function checks if the points lie on the same side of the lines connecting opposite corners, but it does not correctly handle the case where the quadrilateral is convex or concave.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,1.5
```

In this case, the points form a convex quadrilateral with a dent (as shown in the given figure). However, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' because it only checks if the points lie on the same side of the lines connecting opposite corners, which is not sufficient to determine if there is a dent.

A correct approach would involve checking if the cross product of vectors formed by the diagonals has consistent signs, which indicates a convex quadrilateral. If the signs are inconsistent, then the quadrilateral has a dent.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')

def cross_product(p1, p2, p3):
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)

for line in stdin:
    it = (float(s) for s in line.split(','))
    (A, B, C, D) = (Point(next(it), next(it)) for _ in range(4))
    
    # Check if cross products of the diagonals have consistent signs
    cp1 = cross_product(A, C, B)
    cp2 = cross_product(B, D, C)
    if cp1 * cp2 < 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
```

This corrected version uses the cross product to determine if the quadrilateral has a dent, ensuring the correct output for all cases.
