You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: 4 different points on the plane Read the coordinates of $ A (x_a, y_a) $, $ B (x_b, y_b) $, $ C (x_c, y_c) $, $ D (x_d, y_d) $ and read those 4 points Create a program that outputs YES if there is no dent in the quadrangle $ ABCD $ with the coordinates as the vertices, and NO if there is a dent.

A quadrangle with a dent is a quadrangle as shown in Figure 1.

Input

Given multiple datasets. The format of each dataset is as follows.

$ x_a $, $ y_a $, $ x_b $, $ y_b $, $ x_c $, $ y_c $, $ x_d $, $ y_d $

$ x_a $, $ y_a $, $ x_b $, $ y_b $, $ x_c $, $ y_c $, $ x_d $, $ y_d $ are -100 or more and 100 or less, respectively, and are given as real numbers.

1 No more than two points can be lined up on a straight line. Also, if you connect the points in the order of input, the coordinates of the points will be input in the order of forming a quadrangle. (That is, the points are not given in the order shown in Figure 2.)

The number of datasets does not exceed 100.

Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0


Output

YES
NO
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
for line in stdin:
    it = (float(s) for s in line.split(','))
    (A, B, C, D) = (Point(next(it), next(it)) for _ in xrange(4))
    f = func_1(A, C)
    g = func_1(B, D)
    if f(B) == f(D) or g(A) == g(C):
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')

def func_1(p1, p2):
    gradient = (p1.y - p2.y) / (p1.x - p2.x)
    y_intercept = p1.y - gradient * p1.x
    return lambda p: gradient * p.x + y_intercept > p.y


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
