You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hit n nails one by one at the coordinates P1 (x1, y1), P2 (x2, y2), P3 (x3, y3), ..., Pn (xn, yn) on the flat plate, and put them on the rubber band ring. Surround it with a single rubber band so that all the nails fit inside. At this time, the rubber bands must not intersect.

Create a program that reads the coordinates of the nails and outputs the number of nails that are not in contact with the rubber band when the nail is surrounded by the rubber band as described above. The rubber band shall expand and contract sufficiently. You may not hit more than one nail at the same coordinates. In addition, it is assumed that the nails covered with rubber bands are connected by a straight line, and that no more than three nails are lined up on the straight line. For example, there can be no input as shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 2, it is possible for nails without rubber bands to line up in a straight line.

However, each coordinate value is a real number between -1000.0 and 1000.0. Also, n is an integer between 3 and 100.

Hint

Below is a diagram for the second sample input.

Input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:


n
x1, y1
x2, y2
...
...
xn, yn


When n is 0, it indicates the end of input. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Output

For each dataset, output the number of nails that are not in contact with the rubber. For example, if there is an input representing the four nails shown in Fig. 3, it will be surrounded as shown in Fig. 4, so the number of nails that are not in contact with the rubber band is one.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
