Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine which nails are not in contact with the rubber band. Specifically, the function `func_1` and `fn` are not being used correctly to calculate the slope and find the correct tangent points. Additionally, the logic for finding the convex hull using the monotone chain algorithm is incomplete and incorrect.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
9
-509.94,892.63
567.62,639.99
-859.32,-64.84
-445.99,383.69
667.54,430.49
551.12,828.21
-940.2,-877.2
-361.62,-970
-125.42,-178.48
```

The expected output should be `3`, as shown in the problem statement, but the provided program does not produce the correct result. The program fails to properly identify the convex hull and determine which points lie outside it. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
