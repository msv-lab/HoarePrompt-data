Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the number of black and red cockroaches is not equal but can still achieve the alternating pattern with minimal changes.

Consider the following input:
```
4
rbbr
```

For this input, the program should output `1` because Anatoly can swap the second and third cockroaches to achieve the alternating pattern (`rbrb`). However, the current implementation does not consider this possibility.

The program incorrectly calculates the number of swaps needed without properly checking all possible minimal transformations required to achieve the alternating pattern. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
