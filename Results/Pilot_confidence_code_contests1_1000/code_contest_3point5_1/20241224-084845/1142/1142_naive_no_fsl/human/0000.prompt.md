You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's now the season of TAKOYAKI FESTIVAL!

This year, N takoyaki (a ball-shaped food with a piece of octopus inside) will be served. The deliciousness of the i-th takoyaki is d_i.

As is commonly known, when you eat two takoyaki of deliciousness x and y together, you restore x \times y health points.

There are \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2} ways to choose two from the N takoyaki served in the festival. For each of these choices, find the health points restored from eating the two takoyaki, then compute the sum of these \frac{N \times (N - 1)}{2} values.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 50
* 0 \leq d_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N


Output

Print the sum of the health points restored from eating two takoyaki over all possible choices of two takoyaki from the N takoyaki served.

Program:
```
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    sum1 = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum1 = sum1 + d[i]
    sum1 = sum1 * sum1
    sum2 = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum2 = sum2 + d[i] ** 2
    print(sum1 - sum2) / 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
