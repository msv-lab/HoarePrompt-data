Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the longest path with increasing edge weights in a directed graph. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of vertices (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the edges themselves, storing them in appropriate data structures.

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using adjacency lists grouped by edge weights, which allows efficient processing of edges in increasing order of their weights.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the longest path ending at each vertex for each possible edge weight. This ensures that the path with the maximum number of edges is found.

4. **Edge Weight Consideration**: By iterating through the edges in increasing order of their weights, the program ensures that only valid paths (with strictly increasing weights) are considered.

Given these points, the program should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. Since no specific counterexamples were found that would make the program incorrect, we conclude that the program is correct.
