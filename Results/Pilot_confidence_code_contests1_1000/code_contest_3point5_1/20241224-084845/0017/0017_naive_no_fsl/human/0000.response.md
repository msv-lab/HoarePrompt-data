Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly identifies the Apocalypse date according to the given problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Date Format Validation**: The program checks if each part of the potential date (day, month, year) has the correct format. It ensures the year is within the specified range (2013-2015) and the day and month are valid for their respective months.

2. **Leap Year Consideration**: Although the program explicitly states that any year between 2013 and 2015 is not a leap year, it correctly validates the dates without needing to account for leap years since 2014 and 2015 are not leap years.

3. **Frequency Counting**: The program counts how many times each valid date appears in the Prophesy. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each valid date.

4. **Finding the Maximum Frequency**: After counting the frequencies, the program finds the date with the highest frequency and prints it. This ensures that the output is the date mentioned the most times in the Prophesy.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases such as multiple dashes, invalid date formats, and dates outside the specified range. For instance, it skips over invalid dates by checking the length of day, month, and year parts and using the `func_1` function to validate the date.

Given the provided logic and the problem constraints, the program correctly identifies the Apocalypse date in all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
