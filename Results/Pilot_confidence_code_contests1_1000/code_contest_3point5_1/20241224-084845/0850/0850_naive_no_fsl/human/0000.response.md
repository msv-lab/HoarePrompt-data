Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of riders `n` and taxi drivers `m`, followed by the coordinates of all residents and their roles as either riders (`0`) or taxi drivers (`1`). This is done using `rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]`.

2. **Separating Taxi Drivers and Residents**: The program separates the coordinates into two lists: one for taxi drivers and one for residents. This is done by iterating through the list of coordinates and roles, appending coordinates to the `mem` list if the corresponding role is a taxi driver.

3. **Finding Closest Taxi Driver**: For each resident, the program iterates backward through the list of coordinates and roles. It maintains a variable `cur` to track the currently closest taxi driver and updates it when a closer taxi driver is found. The number of residents that call each taxi driver is stored in the `ans` list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as multiple residents having the same distance to a taxi driver by always choosing the taxi driver with the smaller coordinate. This is ensured by the backward iteration and the condition inside the `while` loop.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of residents calling each taxi driver.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it seems to correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that the program does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
