Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the `TeamResult` class's `to_tuple` method. Specifically, it returns the tuple `(self.points, self.goals_missed, self.goals_missed)` instead of `(self.points, self.goals_scored - self.goals_missed, self.goals_scored)`. This means the teams are not being sorted correctly according to the specified rules, leading to incorrect output in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
A
B
C
D
A-B 1:1
A-C 2:2
A-D 1:0
B-C 1:0
B-D 0:3
C-D 0:3
```

The correct output should be:
```
A
D
```

However, due to the mistake in the `to_tuple` method, the program might produce incorrect results. For instance, the sorting based on the incorrect criteria could result in:
```
A
B
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
