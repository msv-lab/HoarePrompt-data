Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is less than the minimum possible sum (`mn`). Specifically, the program calculates `mn` as the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is the minimum possible sum for any valid permutation pair. However, the program incorrectly prints `-1` without attempting to rearrange the runners to find a valid solution when `k` is less than `mn`.

The program should only print `-1` if it's impossible to find any permutation pair `(p, q)` such that the sum of `max(p_i, q_i)` does not exceed `k`. In the given implementation, this check is missing, leading to incorrect behavior when `k` is less than `mn`.

To fix this, the program should first check if `k` is less than `mn` and print `-1` if it is. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
mn = n * (n + 1) // 2

if k < mn:
    print('-1')
else:
    mx = func_2(n)
    target = min(k, mx)
    print(str(target) + '\n')
    a = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    b = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cur = mn
    i = n - 1
    while cur != target:
        f = a[i]
        s = n + 1 - a[i]
        if f - s < target - cur:
            (b[i], b[n - 1 - i]) = (b[n - 1 - i], b[i])
            cur += f - s
            i -= 1
        else:
            j = a[i] - (target - cur) - 1
            (b[i], b[j]) = (b[j], b[i])
            cur = target
    print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))

def func_1(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

def func_2(n):
    k1 = n // 2
    k2 = n - k1
    return 2 * func_1(n) - func_1(k1) - func_1(k2)
```

By adding the initial check for `k < mn`, the program ensures it handles all cases correctly.
