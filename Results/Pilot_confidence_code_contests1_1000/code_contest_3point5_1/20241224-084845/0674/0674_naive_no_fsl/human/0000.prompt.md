You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya got tired of sports programming, left university and got a job in the subway. He was given the task to determine the escalator load factor. 

Let's assume that n people stand in the queue for the escalator. At each second one of the two following possibilities takes place: either the first person in the queue enters the escalator with probability p, or the first person in the queue doesn't move with probability (1 - p), paralyzed by his fear of escalators and making the whole queue wait behind him.

Formally speaking, the i-th person in the queue cannot enter the escalator until people with indices from 1 to i - 1 inclusive enter it. In one second only one person can enter the escalator. The escalator is infinite, so if a person enters it, he never leaves it, that is he will be standing on the escalator at any following second. Ilya needs to count the expected value of the number of people standing on the escalator after t seconds. 

Your task is to help him solve this complicated task.

Input

The first line of the input contains three numbers n, p, t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1). Numbers n and t are integers, number p is real, given with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

Output

Print a single real number — the expected number of people who will be standing on the escalator after t seconds. The absolute or relative error mustn't exceed 10 - 6.

    line = raw_input()
    (n, q, t) = line.split()
    n = int(n)
    t = int(t)
    q = float(q)
    if t <= n:
        print(t * q)
    else:
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(t + 1):
            for j in range(min(t, n) + 1):
                if j == n:
                    dp[i + 1][j] += dp[i][j]
                else:
                    dp[i + 1][j] += (1 - q) * dp[i][j]
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] += q * dp[i][j]
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            ans += i * dp[t][i]
        print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
