Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected number of people standing on the escalator after \(t\) seconds. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming but does not properly handle the probabilistic nature of the problem.

The issue lies in how the `dp` table is filled. The transition probabilities and the way the table is updated do not accurately reflect the problem statement. For instance, when calculating the expected value, the program should consider the probability of each state transitioning to another state over time. However, the current implementation only considers binary transitions (either a person moves or stays) without correctly accounting for the expected value calculation.

To illustrate, let's consider the input:
```
4 0.20 2
```

The expected number of people on the escalator after 2 seconds should be calculated based on the probabilities of each person entering the escalator at each second. The current implementation does not correctly capture these probabilities and transitions, leading to incorrect results.

For example, with \(n = 4\), \(p = 0.2\), and \(t = 2\), the expected number of people on the escalator should be around 0.4, but the program outputs a different result due to its flawed approach to updating the `dp` table.
