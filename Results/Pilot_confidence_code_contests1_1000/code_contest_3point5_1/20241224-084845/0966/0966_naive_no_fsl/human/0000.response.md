Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the rearrangement of dominoes to minimize the maximum sum of columns correctly. Specifically, the program only counts the occurrences of '11', '10', '01', and '00' and then tries to distribute them in a way that might not always result in the minimum possible maximum sum for all columns.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2 3
01 11 00
00 01 11
```

The expected output should be:
```
11 11 10
00 00 01
```

However, the program's logic does not guarantee this optimal arrangement. It primarily focuses on counting and distributing the dominoes based on their types but does not ensure the rearrangement minimizes the maximum sum of columns in all cases.

To illustrate, let's look at another example:
```
3 2
01 11
10 00
01 10
```

The expected optimal output would be:
```
11 01
10 00
10 01
```

But the program might not produce this output due to its current logic, which doesn't account for all possible optimal configurations.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description for certain cases, leading to a verdict of `False`.
