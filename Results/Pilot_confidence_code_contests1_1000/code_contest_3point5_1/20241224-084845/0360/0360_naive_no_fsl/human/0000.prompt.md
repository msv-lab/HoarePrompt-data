You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Smart Beaver from ABBYY invented a new message encryption method and now wants to check its performance. Checking it manually is long and tiresome, so he decided to ask the ABBYY Cup contestants for help.

A message is a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Encryption uses a key which is a sequence of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (m ≤ n). All numbers from the message and from the key belong to the interval from 0 to c - 1, inclusive, and all the calculations are performed modulo c.

Encryption is performed in n - m + 1 steps. On the first step we add to each number a1, a2, ..., am a corresponding number b1, b2, ..., bm. On the second step we add to each number a2, a3, ..., am + 1 (changed on the previous step) a corresponding number b1, b2, ..., bm. And so on: on step number i we add to each number ai, ai + 1, ..., ai + m - 1 a corresponding number b1, b2, ..., bm. The result of the encryption is the sequence a1, a2, ..., an after n - m + 1 steps.

Help the Beaver to write a program that will encrypt messages in the described manner.

Input

The first input line contains three integers n, m and c, separated by single spaces. 

The second input line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai < c), separated by single spaces — the original message. 

The third input line contains m integers bi (0 ≤ bi < c), separated by single spaces — the encryption key.

The input limitations for getting 30 points are: 

  * 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 103
  * 1 ≤ c ≤ 103



The input limitations for getting 100 points are: 

  * 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 105
  * 1 ≤ c ≤ 103

Output

Print n space-separated integers — the result of encrypting the original message.

Examples

Input

4 3 2
1 1 1 1
1 1 1


Output

0 1 1 0


Input

3 1 5
1 2 3
4


Output

0 1 2

Note

In the first sample the encryption is performed in two steps: after the first step a = (0, 0, 0, 1) (remember that the calculations are performed modulo 2), after the second step a = (0, 1, 1, 0), and that is the answer. 
Program:
```
try:
    input = raw_input
except:
    pass
(n, m, c) = list(map(int, input().split()))
msg = list(map(int, input().split()))
key = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = [start for start in msg]
func_2()
print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1():
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        for k in range(m):
            result[i + k] = (result[i + k] + key[k]) % c

def func_2():
    total = sum(key)
    inckeys = []
    t = 0
    for i in range(m):
        t += key[i]
        inckeys.append(t)
    lastkeys = []
    t = 0
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        t += key[i]
        lastkeys.append(t)
    lastkeys.reverse()
    for i in range(0, min(m, n - m + 1)):
        result[i] = (result[i] + inckeys[i]) % c
    for i in range(min(m, n - m + 1), n - m + 1):
        result[i] = (result[i] + total) % c
    for i in range(n - m + 1, n):
        result[i] = (result[i] + lastkeys[i % (n - m + 1)]) % c
    return result


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
