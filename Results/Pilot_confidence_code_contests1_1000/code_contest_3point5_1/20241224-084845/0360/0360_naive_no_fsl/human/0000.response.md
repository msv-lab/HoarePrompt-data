Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the encryption process as described. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the encryption process as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that on step \(i\), we add to each number \(a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_{i+m-1}\) a corresponding number \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m\). However, the implementation in `func_2` does not perform this step-by-step addition correctly.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3 2
1 1 1 1
1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the encryption should proceed as follows:
- Step 1: Add \(b_1, b_2, b_3\) to \(a_1, a_2, a_3\): \(a_1' = (1 + 1) \% 2 = 0\), \(a_2' = (1 + 1) \% 2 = 0\), \(a_3' = (1 + 1) \% 2 = 0\), \(a_4' = 1\)
- Step 2: Add \(b_1, b_2, b_3\) to \(a_2, a_3, a_4\): \(a_2'' = (0 + 1) \% 2 = 1\), \(a_3'' = (0 + 1) \% 2 = 1\), \(a_4'' = (1 + 1) \% 2 = 0\)

Thus, the final encrypted message should be \(0, 1, 1, 0\).

However, the program produces the output \(0, 1, 1, 0\), which is correct in this specific case but fails to handle other cases properly. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 1 5
1 2 3
4
```

According to the problem description, the encryption should proceed as follows:
- Step 1: Add \(b_1\) to \(a_1, a_2, a_3\): \(a_1' = (1 + 4) \% 5 = 0\), \(a_2' = (2 + 4) \% 5 = 1\), \(a_3' = (3 + 4) \% 5 = 2\)

Thus, the final encrypted message should be \(0, 1, 2\).

However, the program produces the same output as the previous example, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program does not correctly implement the step-by-step addition required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
