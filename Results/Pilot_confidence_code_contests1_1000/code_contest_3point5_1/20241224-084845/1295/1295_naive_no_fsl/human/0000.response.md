Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the z-sort algorithm. Specifically, the program sorts the entire array before attempting to rearrange it into the z-sorted order. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will meet the z-sort conditions.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 2 2 5
```

The program outputs:
```
1 5 2 3 2
```

However, this output is incorrect because the array `[1, 5, 2, 3, 2]` does not satisfy the z-sort conditions. For instance, `a_2 = 5` and `a_3 = 2`, which violates the condition `a_i ≤ a_{i-1}` for odd `i`.

To correctly implement the z-sort algorithm, the program needs to ensure that for even indices, the elements are non-decreasing (`a_i ≥ a_{i-1}`), and for odd indices greater than 1, the elements are non-increasing (`a_i ≤ a_{i-1}`). The current implementation does not handle these conditions properly.
