Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how it processes the input and calculates the number of required cashes. The program counts the number of people arriving at each specific time and prints the maximum count as the number of required cashes. However, this approach does not account for the scenario where multiple people arrive simultaneously.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
8 0
8 10
8 10
8 45
```

According to the problem description, two people will arrive at 8:10, so we need at least two cashes to serve them both. However, the program will output 1 because it counts the maximum number of people arriving at any single minute, which in this case is 1 (at 8:0, 8:45).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to track the number of people arriving over time and ensure that the number of cashes is always at least equal to the number of people in the cafe at any given moment. This requires maintaining a timeline of arrivals and departures and calculating the peak number of people in the cafe at any time.
