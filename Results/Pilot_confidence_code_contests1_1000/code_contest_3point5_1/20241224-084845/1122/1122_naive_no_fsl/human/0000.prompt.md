You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera runs a 24/7 fast food cafe. He magically learned that next day n people will visit his cafe. For each person we know the arrival time: the i-th person comes exactly at hi hours mi minutes. The cafe spends less than a minute to serve each client, but if a client comes in and sees that there is no free cash, than he doesn't want to wait and leaves the cafe immediately. 

Valera is very greedy, so he wants to serve all n customers next day (and get more profit). However, for that he needs to ensure that at each moment of time the number of working cashes is no less than the number of clients in the cafe. 

Help Valera count the minimum number of cashes to work at his cafe next day, so that they can serve all visitors.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), that is the number of cafe visitors.

Each of the following n lines has two space-separated integers hi and mi (0 ≤ hi ≤ 23; 0 ≤ mi ≤ 59), representing the time when the i-th person comes into the cafe. 

Note that the time is given in the chronological order. All time is given within one 24-hour period.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of cashes, needed to serve all clients next day.

Examples

Input

4
8 0
8 10
8 10
8 45


Output

2


Input

3
0 12
10 11
22 22


Output

1

Note

In the first sample it is not enough one cash to serve all clients, because two visitors will come into cafe in 8:10. Therefore, if there will be one cash in cafe, then one customer will be served by it, and another one will not wait and will go away.

In the second sample all visitors will come in different times, so it will be enough one cash.
Program:
```
import collections

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    events = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        events.append(raw_input())
    counter = collections.Counter(events)
    print(max(counter.values()))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
