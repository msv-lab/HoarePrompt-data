You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have an integer sequence A, whose length is N.

Find the number of the non-empty contiguous subsequences of A whose sums are 0. Note that we are counting the ways to take out subsequences. That is, even if the contents of some two subsequences are the same, they are counted individually if they are taken from different positions.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^9 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Find the number of the non-empty contiguous subsequences of A whose sum is 0.

Examples

Input

6
1 3 -4 2 2 -2


Output

Program:
```
def func():
    exec("def nWord(): nWord.cache = raw_input() if not hasattr(nWord, 'cache') or nWord.cache=='' else nWord.cache ; pos = nWord.cache.find(nWord.sep) ; ret, nWord.cache = (nWord.cache, '') if pos==-1 else (nWord.cache[:pos], nWord.cache[pos+1:].lstrip(nWord.sep)) ; return ret")
    exec("nWord.sep = ' '")
    exec("def ___nLine2(): ret, nWord.cache = (raw_input(), nWord.cache if hasattr(nWord, 'cache') else '') if not hasattr(nWord, 'cache') or nWord.cache=='' else (nWord.cache, '') ; return ret")
    exec('def nInt(): return int(nWord())')
    exec('def nFloat(): return float(nWord())')
    exec('def ___nAuto2():\n ret = nWord()\n try: return int(ret)\n except: pass\n try: return float(ret)\n except: return ret')
    exec('def nAuto(n=None): return ___nAuto2() if n is None else [___nAuto2() for i in range(n)]')
    exec('def nLine(n=None): return ___nLine2() if n is None else [___nLine2() for i in range(n)]')
    nAuto()
    A = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split(' ')]
    A.reverse()
    A.append(0)
    A.reverse()
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        A[i] = A[i] + A[i - 1]
    dic = {}
    cnt = 0
    for i in A:
        if i not in dic:
            dic[i] = 1
        else:
            cnt += dic[i]
            dic[i] += 1
    print(cnt)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
