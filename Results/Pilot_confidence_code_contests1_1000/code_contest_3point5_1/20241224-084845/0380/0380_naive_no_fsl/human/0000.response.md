Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to reverse the array and then calculate prefix sums, but this approach is flawed. 

The core issue lies in how the program calculates the counts of subarrays with a sum of zero. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of prefix sums and increments the count whenever it encounters a repeated prefix sum. However, this approach fails to account for all possible contiguous subarrays with a sum of zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```

The correct answer should be 6 because there are six non-empty contiguous subarrays with a sum of zero:
- [-1]
- [1, -1]
- [-1, 1, -1]
- [1, -1, 1, -1]
- [-1, 1]
- [1, -1]

However, the provided program would only count:
- [1, -1]
- [1, -1, 1, -1]
- [-1, 1, -1]
- [-1, 1]

Thus, the program undercounts the number of valid subarrays. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
