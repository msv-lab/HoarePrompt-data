Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of stolen utensils. Specifically, the program calculates `len(set(a)) * ((ma + k - 1) / k)) - n` to find the minimum number of stolen utensils, which is not correct according to the problem description.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
5 2
1 2 2 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

This happens because the program incorrectly uses the maximum frequency (`ma`) of any utensil type and divides it by `k`, which does not reflect the actual constraints of the problem. The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of dishes each guest had, which is equivalent to finding the smallest integer \( d \) such that the total number of utensils used is at least \( n \). This can be calculated as `ceiling(n / k) * len(set(a))`.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the minimum number of dishes per guest and then determining the minimum number of utensils required. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter
from math import ceil

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count = Counter(a)
    dishes_per_guest = ceil(n / k)
    min_utensils_needed = dishes_per_guest * len(count)
    print(min_utensils_needed - n)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the minimum number of utensils needed is calculated correctly based on the number of guests and the unique utensil types.
