You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A sequence of n non-negative integers (n ≥ 2) a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is called good if for all i from 1 to n-1 the following condition holds true: $$$a_1 \: \& \: a_2 \: \& \: ... \: \& \: a_i = a_{i+1} \: \& \: a_{i+2} \: \& \: ... \: \& \: a_n, where \&$$$ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).

You are given an array a of size n (n ≥ 2). Find the number of permutations p of numbers ranging from 1 to n, for which the sequence a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, ... ,a_{p_n} is good. Since this number can be large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Output t lines, where the i-th line contains the number of good permutations in the i-th test case modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input

3
1 1 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
0 2 0 3 0
4
1 3 5 1


Output


6
0
36
4

Note

In the first test case, since all the numbers are equal, whatever permutation we take, the sequence is good. There are a total of 6 permutations possible with numbers from 1 to 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

In the second test case, it can be proved that no permutation exists for which the sequence is good.

In the third test case, there are a total of 36 permutations for which the sequence is good. One of them is the permutation [1,5,4,2,3] which results in the sequence s=[0,0,3,2,0]. This is a good sequence because 

  *  s_1 = s_2 \: \& \: s_3 \: \& \: s_4 \: \& \: s_5 = 0, 
  *  s_1 \: \& \: s_2 = s_3 \: \& \: s_4 \: \& \: s_5 = 0, 
  *  s_1 \: \& \: s_2 \: \& \: s_3 = s_4 \: \& \: s_5 = 0, 
  *  s_1 \: \& \: s_2 \: \& \: s_3 \: \& \: s_4 = s_5 = 0.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
