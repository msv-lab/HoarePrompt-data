You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: zscoder wants to generate an input file for some programming competition problem.

His input is a string consisting of n letters 'a'. He is too lazy to write a generator so he will manually generate the input in a text editor.

Initially, the text editor is empty. It takes him x seconds to insert or delete a letter 'a' from the text file and y seconds to copy the contents of the entire text file, and duplicate it.

zscoder wants to find the minimum amount of time needed for him to create the input file of exactly n letters 'a'. Help him to determine the amount of time needed to generate the input.

Input

The only line contains three integers n, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 107, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 109) — the number of letters 'a' in the input file and the parameters from the problem statement.

Output

Print the only integer t — the minimum amount of time needed to generate the input file.

Examples

Input

8 1 1


Output

4


Input

8 1 10


Output

8
Program:
```
i = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
print(func_1(i))

def func_1(params):
    assigned = 1
    total = params[1]
    while assigned < params[0]:
        double = assigned * 2
        if double > params[0]:
            return total + (params[0] - assigned) * params[1]
        else:
            one_cost = assigned * params[1]
            if one_cost > params[2]:
                total += params[2]
                assigned *= 2
            else:
                total += params[1]
                assigned += 1
    return total


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
