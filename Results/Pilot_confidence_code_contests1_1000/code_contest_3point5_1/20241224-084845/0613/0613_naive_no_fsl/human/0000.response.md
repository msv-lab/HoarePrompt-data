Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where there are more than two occurrences of the same number but not exactly two. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 3 3 4
```

The program should output "NO" because it's impossible to split the sequence into a strictly increasing and a strictly decreasing sequence since the number `3` appears three times, which cannot be split into both increasing and decreasing subsequences without contradiction.

However, the current implementation does not detect this issue and may incorrectly handle such cases. It only checks if a number appears more than twice, but it doesn't account for the specific constraint that each number can appear at most twice in the final split sequences.
