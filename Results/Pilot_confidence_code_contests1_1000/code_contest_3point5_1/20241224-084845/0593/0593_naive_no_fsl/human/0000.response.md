Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of pairs where the Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance are equal. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

For the input:
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```

The expected output should be 6 because there are 6 pairs of points that have the same Manhattan and Euclidean distance:
- (0,0) and (1,1)
- (0,1) and (1,0)

However, the program incorrectly counts these pairs. The program counts the number of points along the x-axis and y-axis separately and then combines these counts without properly accounting for the overlapping pairs. This leads to an overcount of pairs.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and count only those pairs where the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates are equal, which would indicate that the Manhattan and Euclidean distances are the same. The current implementation does not achieve this.
