You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Being a programmer, you like arrays a lot. For your birthday, your friends have given you an array a consisting of n distinct integers.

Unfortunately, the size of a is too small. You want a bigger array! Your friends agree to give you a bigger array, but only if you are able to answer the following question correctly: is it possible to sort the array a (in increasing order) by reversing exactly one segment of a? See definitions of segment and reversing in the notes.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the size of array a.

The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 109).

Output

Print "yes" or "no" (without quotes), depending on the answer.

If your answer is "yes", then also print two space-separated integers denoting start and end (start must not be greater than end) indices of the segment to be reversed. If there are multiple ways of selecting these indices, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3
3 2 1


Output

yes
1 3


Input

4
2 1 3 4


Output

yes
1 2


Input

4
3 1 2 4


Output

no


Input

2
1 2


Output

yes
1 1

Note

Sample 1. You can reverse the entire array to get [1, 2, 3], which is sorted.

Sample 3. No segment can be reversed such that the array will be sorted.

Definitions

A segment [l, r] of array a is the sequence a[l], a[l + 1], ..., a[r].

If you have an array a of size n and you reverse its segment [l, r], the array will become:

a[1], a[2], ..., a[l - 2], a[l - 1], a[r], a[r - 1], ..., a[l + 1], a[l], a[r + 1], a[r + 2], ..., a[n - 1], a[n].
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split(' ')]
    b = sorted(a)
    (f, t) = (0, 0)
    for i in xrange(n):
        if a[i] != b[i]:
            f = i
            break
    for i in xrange(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if a[i] != b[i]:
            t = i
            break
    if a[:f] + a[f:t + 1][::-1] + a[t + 1:] == b:
        sys.stdout.write('yes\n%s %s' % (f + 1, t + 1))
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('no')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
