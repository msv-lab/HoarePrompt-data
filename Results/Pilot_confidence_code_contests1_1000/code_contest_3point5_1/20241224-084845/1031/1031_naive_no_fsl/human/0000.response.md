Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count all even substrings. Let's consider the input "2244" as given in the example. According to the problem description, the output should be 10 because there are 10 different even substrings:

- s[1 ... 1], s[2 ... 2], s[3 ... 3], s[4 ... 4] (single characters "2")
- s[1 ... 2], s[2 ... 3], s[3 ... 4] (substrings "22", "24", "44")
- s[1 ... 3], s[2 ... 4] (substrings "224", "244")

However, the program only counts the positions where the character is even, which means it would count 6 even substrings:

- s[1 ... 1], s[2 ... 2], s[3 ... 3], s[4 ... 4] (single characters "2")
- s[1 ... 2], s[2 ... 2], s[3 ... 4] (substrings "22", "24", "44")

This is because the program increments `cnt` for each position `i` where `l[i]` is even, but it doesn't account for overlapping substrings. To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible substrings starting from each even-indexed character and count them separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
s = input()

cnt = 0
for i in range(n):
    if int(s[i]) % 2 == 0:
        # Count all substrings starting from this even index
        for j in range(i, n):
            cnt += 1

print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that all substrings starting from each even-indexed character are counted, thus providing the correct result.
