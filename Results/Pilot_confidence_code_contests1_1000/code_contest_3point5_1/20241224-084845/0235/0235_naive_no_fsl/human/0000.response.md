Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where turning a specific cell into a wall would disconnect the remaining cells. Specifically, the program uses a simple breadth-first search (BFS) approach to mark cells as visited but does not ensure that turning any of these marked cells into walls will keep the remaining cells connected.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3 1
###
#.#
###
```

The program will mark the center cell as visited and then try to turn it into a wall, but this will disconnect the top-right and bottom-right cells. The program does not check if turning a particular cell into a wall keeps the maze connected.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after marking cells as visited, it checks if turning any of these cells into walls will maintain the connectivity of the remaining cells. This can be done by checking all possible ways to place walls and verifying the connectivity of the resulting maze.
