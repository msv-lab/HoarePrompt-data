You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel loves grid mazes. A grid maze is an n × m rectangle maze where each cell is either empty, or is a wall. You can go from one cell to another only if both cells are empty and have a common side.

Pavel drew a grid maze with all empty cells forming a connected area. That is, you can go from any empty cell to any other one. Pavel doesn't like it when his maze has too little walls. He wants to turn exactly k empty cells into walls so that all the remaining cells still formed a connected area. Help him.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ k < s), where n and m are the maze's height and width, correspondingly, k is the number of walls Pavel wants to add and letter s represents the number of empty cells in the original maze.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters. They describe the original maze. If a character on a line equals ".", then the corresponding cell is empty and if the character equals "#", then the cell is a wall.

Output

Print n lines containing m characters each: the new maze that fits Pavel's requirements. Mark the empty cells that you transformed into walls as "X", the other cells must be left without changes (that is, "." and "#").

It is guaranteed that a solution exists. If there are multiple solutions you can output any of them.

    return row >= 0 and row < len(grid) and (col >= 0) and (col < len(grid[0])) and (grid[row][col] == 'nv')

            return
        grid[row][col] = '.'
        points.append((row, col))
        if func_1(grid, row - 1, col):
            stack.append((row - 1, col))
        if func_1(grid, row, col - 1):
            stack.append((row, col - 1))
        if func_1(grid, row + 1, col):
            stack.append((row + 1, col))
        if func_1(grid, row, col + 1):
            stack.append((row, col + 1))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
