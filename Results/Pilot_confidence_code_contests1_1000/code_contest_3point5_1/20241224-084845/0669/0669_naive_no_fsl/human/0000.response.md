Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine if a number can be expressed as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers. The formula used to calculate `x2` is incorrect for this problem. The program attempts to solve a different mathematical problem related to quadratic residues and does not address the specific requirement of checking for the sum of cubes.

A correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `a` and checking if `x - a^3` is a perfect cube. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        found = False
        for a in range(1, int(x**(1/3)) + 1):
            b_cubed = x - a**3
            b = round(b_cubed ** (1/3))
            if b**3 == b_cubed:
                found = True
                break
        results.append("YES" if found else "NO")

    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected program iterates over possible values of `a` and checks if `x - a^3` is a perfect cube, which aligns with the problem description.
