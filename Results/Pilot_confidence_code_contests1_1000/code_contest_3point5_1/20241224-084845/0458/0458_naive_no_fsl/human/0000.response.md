Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine if the body is in equilibrium. The issue lies in the calculation of the sum of the vectors. Instead of adding the vectors, the program is subtracting them. This will not yield the correct result for determining equilibrium.

To fix this, the program should add the vectors instead of subtracting them. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    class Vector:
    
        def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, z=0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.z = z
    
        def __add__(self, v):
            ans = Vector(self.x + v.x, self.y + v.y, self.z + v.z)
            return ans
    
        def __str__(self):
            return 'x: %d y: %d z: %d' % (self.x, self.y, self.z)
    
        def inEquilibrium(self):
            return 'YES' if self.x == 0 and self.y == 0 and (self.z == 0) else 'NO'
    n = int(input())
    v_list = []
    while n > 0:
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        v = Vector(s[0], s[1], s[2])
        v_list.append(v)
        n -= 1
    _sum = Vector()
    for v in v_list:
        _sum += v  # Corrected from '-' to '+='
    print(_sum.inEquilibrium())

func()
```

With this correction, the program will now correctly determine if the body is in equilibrium by checking if the sum of all force vectors is zero.
