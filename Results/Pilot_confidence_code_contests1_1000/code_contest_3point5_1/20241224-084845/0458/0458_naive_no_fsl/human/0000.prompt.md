You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. "Piece of cake" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), then follow n lines containing three integers each: the xi coordinate, the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi, zi ≤ 100).

Output

Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

Program:

def func():
    class Vector:
    
        def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, z=0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.z = z
    
        def __add__(self, v):
            ans = Vector(self.x + v.x, self.y + v.y, self.z + v.z)
            return ans
    
        def __sub__(self, v):
            ans = Vector(self.x - v.x, self.y - v.y, self.z - v.z)
            return ans
    
        def __str__(self):
            return 'x: %d y: %d z: %d' % (self.x, self.y, self.z)
    
        def inEquilibrium(self):
            return 'YES' if self.x == 0 and self.y == 0 and (self.z == 0) else 'NO'
    n = int(raw_input())
    v_list = []
    while n > 0:
        s = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        v = Vector(s[0], s[1], s[2])
        v_list.append(v)
        n -= 1
    _sum = Vector()
    for v in v_list:
        _sum -= v
    print(_sum.inEquilibrium())

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
