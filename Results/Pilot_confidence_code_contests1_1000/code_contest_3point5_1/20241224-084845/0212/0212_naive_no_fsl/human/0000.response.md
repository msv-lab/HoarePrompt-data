Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility of reaching the destination point in exactly `k` moves with the maximum number of diagonal moves when both `n` and `m` are even and `k` is odd.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. The program checks if `k` is less than `max(n, m)`. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
2. For the case where `n == m`, the program checks if `(k - n) % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints `k`, otherwise it prints `k - 2`.
3. For the case where `m - n` is even, it calculates the maximum steps needed (`steps = max(n, m)`) and checks if `(k - steps) % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints `k`, otherwise it prints `k - 2`.
4. For the remaining case, it calculates the maximum steps needed (`steps = max(m, n)`) and checks if `(k - steps) % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints `k - 1`, otherwise it prints `k - 1`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where `n` and `m` are both even and `k` is odd. In this case, it is possible to make all diagonal moves, but the current logic does not account for this.

Consider the following example:
- Query: `2 2 3`
- Expected output: `2`

The correct solution would allow for two diagonal moves: `(0, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 2)`. However, the current implementation only allows for one diagonal move (`1`) because it does not properly handle the case where `k` is odd and both `n` and `m` are even.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where both `n` and `m` are even and `k` is odd separately, allowing for the maximum number of diagonal moves.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
