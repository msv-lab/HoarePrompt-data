You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mikhail walks on a Cartesian plane. He starts at the point (0, 0), and in one move he can go to any of eight adjacent points. For example, if Mikhail is currently at the point (0, 0), he can go to any of the following points in one move: 

  * (1, 0); 
  * (1, 1); 
  * (0, 1); 
  * (-1, 1); 
  * (-1, 0); 
  * (-1, -1); 
  * (0, -1); 
  * (1, -1). 



If Mikhail goes from the point (x1, y1) to the point (x2, y2) in one move, and x1 ≠ x2 and y1 ≠ y2, then such a move is called a diagonal move.

Mikhail has q queries. For the i-th query Mikhail's target is to go to the point (n_i, m_i) from the point (0, 0) in exactly k_i moves. Among all possible movements he want to choose one with the maximum number of diagonal moves. Your task is to find the maximum number of diagonal moves or find that it is impossible to go from the point (0, 0) to the point (n_i, m_i) in k_i moves.

Note that Mikhail can visit any point any number of times (even the destination point!).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4) — the number of queries.

Then q lines follow. The i-th of these q lines contains three integers n_i, m_i and k_i (1 ≤ n_i, m_i, k_i ≤ 10^{18}) — x-coordinate of the destination point of the query, y-coordinate of the destination point of the query and the number of moves in the query, correspondingly.

Output

Print q integers. The i-th integer should be equal to -1 if Mikhail cannot go from the point (0, 0) to the point (n_i, m_i) in exactly k_i moves described above. Otherwise the i-th integer should be equal to the the maximum number of diagonal moves among all possible movements.

Example

Input

3
2 2 3
4 3 7
10 1 9


Output

1
6
-1

Note

One of the possible answers to the first test case: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 2).

One of the possible answers to the second test case: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 4) → (2, 3) → (3, 2) → (4, 3).

In the third test case Mikhail cannot reach the point (10, 1) in 9 moves.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
