Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sequence is already sorted but contains elements greater than `x`. In such cases, the program incorrectly increments the count (`cnt`) even though no swaps are necessary. For example, consider the input:

```
4 1
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, the sequence is already sorted, and no swaps are needed. However, the program will still increment `cnt` because it checks `l[i] <= l[i + 1]` without properly considering the condition for the sequence to be sorted after all operations. This leads to an incorrect result.
