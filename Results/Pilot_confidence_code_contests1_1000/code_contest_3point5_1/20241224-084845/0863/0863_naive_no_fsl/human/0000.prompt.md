You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and an integer x. Your task is to make the sequence a sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ a_3 ≤ ... ≤ a_n holds).

To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and a_i > x, and swap the values of a_i and x.

For example, if a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4], x = 1, the following sequence of operations is possible:

  1. choose i = 2 (it is possible since a_2 > x), then a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 4], x = 2; 
  2. choose i = 3 (it is possible since a_3 > x), then a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4], x = 3; 
  3. choose i = 4 (it is possible since a_4 > x), then a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], x = 5. 



Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that a becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ x ≤ 500) — the number of elements in the sequence and the initial value of x.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 500).

The sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 500.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make a sorted, or -1, if it is impossible.

            if x < l[i]:
                tcnt += 1
                x = l[i]
        elif x > l[i + 1]:
            cnt = -1
            break
        else:
            cnt += tcnt + 1
            x = l[i]
            tcnt = 0
    print(cnt)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
