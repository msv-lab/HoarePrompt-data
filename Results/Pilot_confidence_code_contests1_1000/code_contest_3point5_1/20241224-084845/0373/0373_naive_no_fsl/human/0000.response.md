Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The program correctly reads the input values for the number of teleports `n` and the location of the friend's house `m`.
- It initializes a list `f` to keep track of which points can be reached using the teleports.
- For each teleport, it marks all reachable points within its limit in the list `f`.
- It checks if the starting point (0) and the end point (`m`) are reachable.
- It ensures that there are no gaps in the reachable points between the start and the end.
- The program handles all edge cases, such as starting from a non-zero point, reaching the destination exactly, and ensuring no unreachable segments exist.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
