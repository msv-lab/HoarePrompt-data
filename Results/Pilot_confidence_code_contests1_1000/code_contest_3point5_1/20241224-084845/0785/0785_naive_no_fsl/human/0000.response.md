Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Initial State**: The initial state of the table is not properly handled. The program assumes there is exactly one cell initially switched on, but it does not account for the exact number of cells that need to be turned on in subsequent steps. This can lead to incorrect results, especially for larger values of `n` and `c`.

2. **Incorrect Function Definitions and Usage**: Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are defined but not used appropriately. For instance, `func_1` is used to read input but is not utilized correctly in the main logic. Similarly, `func_2` and `func_3` are defined but not used.

3. **Logic Errors in `func_4` and `func_5`**: 
   - `func_4` calculates the number of turned-on cells incorrectly. It does not accurately account for the growth pattern of the turned-on cells over time.
   - `func_5` uses binary search to find the minimum time required to turn on at least `c` cells, but the logic inside `func_4` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:
```
9 3 8 10
```

Expected Output: 2
Actual Output: Incorrect (likely due to the flawed logic in `func_4` and `func_5`)

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is marked as incorrect.
