Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the sum of the lengths of the platforms is less than the distance `d` for the last platform correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
Input:
10 2 5
2 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to reach `n+1` from `0`. In this case, the platforms are of lengths 2 and 3, and the maximum jump distance is 5. The program attempts to place the platforms and check the feasibility of the jump, but it fails to handle the case where the last platform cannot be fully placed without violating the jump constraint.

In the given input:
- The first platform of length 2 can be placed at positions `[0, 1]`.
- The second platform of length 3 needs to start at position 5 or later to avoid overlapping with the first platform. However, placing it starting from 5 would require a gap of at least 2 units before it, which is within the jump distance of 5. But the program does not correctly ensure this placement.

The program should verify that the last platform can be placed such that it does not violate the jump constraint. Here, placing the second platform starting from position 5 would make the total gap `2 + 5 = 7`, which is valid. However, the current implementation does not account for this correctly.

Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case, making it incorrect.
