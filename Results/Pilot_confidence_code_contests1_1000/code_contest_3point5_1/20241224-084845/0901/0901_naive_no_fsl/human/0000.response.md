Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a friend visits before Hiasat can change his handle. Specifically, the program starts counting friends only after the first handle change event (`state == 1`), which means it misses the opportunity to count friends who visit before the first handle change. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 2
1
2 alice
2 bob
```

In this case, the program should recognize that both "alice" and "bob" can be happy because they can see the handle before the first handle change event. However, the current implementation will not count either of them as happy because it only starts counting from the first handle change event. This violates the requirement that friends should be counted as happy if their handle matches at the moment of their visit.
