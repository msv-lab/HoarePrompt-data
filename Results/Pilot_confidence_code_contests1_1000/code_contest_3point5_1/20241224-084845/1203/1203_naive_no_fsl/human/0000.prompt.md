You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Furlo and Rublo play a game. The table has n piles of coins lying on it, the i-th pile has ai coins. Furlo and Rublo move in turns, Furlo moves first. In one move you are allowed to:

  * choose some pile, let's denote the current number of coins in it as x; 
  * choose some integer y (0 ≤ y < x; x1 / 4 ≤ y ≤ x1 / 2) and decrease the number of coins in this pile to y. In other words, after the described move the pile will have y coins left. 



The player who can't make a move, loses. 

Your task is to find out, who wins in the given game if both Furlo and Rublo play optimally well.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 77777) — the number of piles. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 777777777777) — the sizes of piles. The numbers are separated by single spaces.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

If both players play optimally well and Furlo wins, print "Furlo", otherwise print "Rublo". Print the answers without the quotes.

    for i in range(n):
        c = int(format(a[i], 'b'))
        res += c
    res = str(res)
    for i in range(len(res)):
        if int(res[i]) % 2 == 0:
            print('Furlo')
            return
    print('Rublo')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
