Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input graph cannot satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check if the given edges create a scenario where it is impossible to assign love/hate relationships such that every triangle is either a "happy" triangle (exactly one pair in love) or all pairs in love.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `1`, as the only valid configuration is to make 1 and 3 love each other, and 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this case and will likely produce incorrect results due to the lack of proper validation for the input constraints.

To fix this, the program needs to include additional checks to ensure that the input graph does not lead to contradictions. For instance, it should verify that there are no cycles where the relationships form a contradiction (e.g., a cycle of length 3 with conflicting love/hate relationships).
