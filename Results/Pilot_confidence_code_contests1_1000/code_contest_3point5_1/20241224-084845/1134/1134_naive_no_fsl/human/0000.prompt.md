You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While swimming at the beach, Mike has accidentally dropped his cellphone into the water. There was no worry as he bought a cheap replacement phone with an old-fashioned keyboard. The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys, located in the following way:

<image>

Together with his old phone, he lost all his contacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put some number in. One can formally consider finger movements as a sequence of vectors connecting centers of keys pressed consecutively to put in a number. For example, the finger movements for number "586" are the same as finger movements for number "253":

<image> <image>

Mike has already put in a number by his "finger memory" and started calling it, so he is now worrying, can he be sure that he is calling the correct number? In other words, is there any other number, that has the same finger movements?

Input

The first line of the input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) — the number of digits in the phone number that Mike put in.

The second line contains the string consisting of n digits (characters from '0' to '9') representing the number that Mike put in.

Output

If there is no other phone number with the same finger movements and Mike can be sure he is calling the correct number, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line.

Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line.

Examples

Input

586


Output

NO

09


Output

NO

911


Output

YES

Note

You can find the picture clarifying the first sample case in the statement above.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    a = []
    for i in range(10):
        a.append(True)
    for i in range(n):
        c = int(s[i])
        a[c] = False
    inc = 0
    if a[1] and a[2] and a[3]:
        inc = -3
    if a[7] and a[9] and a[0]:
        inc = +3
    if a[1] and a[4] and a[7] and a[0]:
        inc = -1
    if a[3] and a[6] and a[9] and a[0]:
        inc = +1
    if inc == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
