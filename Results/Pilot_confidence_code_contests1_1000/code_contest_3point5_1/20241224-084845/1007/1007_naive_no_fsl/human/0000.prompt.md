You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lately, a national version of a bingo game has become very popular in Berland. There are n players playing the game, each player has a card with numbers. The numbers on each card are distinct, but distinct cards can have equal numbers. The card of the i-th player contains mi numbers.

During the game the host takes numbered balls one by one from a bag. He reads the number aloud in a high and clear voice and then puts the ball away. All participants cross out the number if it occurs on their cards. The person who crosses out all numbers from his card first, wins. If multiple people cross out all numbers from their cards at the same time, there are no winners in the game. At the beginning of the game the bag contains 100 balls numbered 1 through 100, the numbers of all balls are distinct.

You are given the cards for each player. Write a program that determines whether a player can win the game at the most favorable for him scenario or not.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the players. Then follow n lines, each line describes a player's card. The line that describes a card starts from integer mi (1 ≤ mi ≤ 100) that shows how many numbers the i-th player's card has. Then follows a sequence of integers ai, 1, ai, 2, ..., ai, mi (1 ≤ ai, k ≤ 100) — the numbers on the i-th player's card. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

It is guaranteed that all the numbers on each card are distinct.

Output

Print n lines, the i-th line must contain word "YES" (without the quotes), if the i-th player can win, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
1 1
3 2 4 1
2 10 11


Output

YES
NO
YES


Input

2
1 1
1 1


Output

NO
NO
Program:
```
import sys, math

def func():
    nums = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        for word in line.split():
            nums.append(float(word))
    nums.reverse()
    for num in nums:
        print('%.4f' % math.sqrt(num))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
