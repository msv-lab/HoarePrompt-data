You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The end of the school year is near and Ms. Manana, the teacher, will soon have to say goodbye to a yet another class. She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her n students and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking and tessellating pieces).

The shop assistant told the teacher that there are m puzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of f1 pieces, the second one consists of f2 pieces and so on.

Ms. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. Let A be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys and B be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose such n puzzles that A - B is minimum possible. Help the teacher and find the least possible value of A - B.

Input

The first line contains space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 50). The second line contains m space-separated integers f1, f2, ..., fm (4 ≤ fi ≤ 1000) — the quantities of pieces in the puzzles sold in the shop.

Output

Print a single integer — the least possible difference the teacher can obtain.

Examples

Input

4 6
10 12 10 7 5 22


Output

5

Note

Sample 1. The class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10 and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4 and 5 to obtain the difference 5.
Program:
```
def func():
    (students, num_puzzles) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    puzzles = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    puzzles.sort()
    best = 999999
    for i in range(num_puzzles - students + 1):
        best = min(puzzles[i + students - 1] - puzzles[i], best)
    if best == 999999:
        best = puzzles[-1] - puzzles[0]
    print(best)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
