Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` is not defined to perform the necessary operations to calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened based on the given conditions.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the number of odd and even numbered chests and keys but does not correctly determine how to match them to maximize the number of chests that can be opened.
2. **Missing Logic**: There is no logic to pair the keys and chests such that their sum is odd. The current implementation does not account for the fact that keys and chests need to be paired in a way that maximizes the count of opened chests.

A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the number of odd and even numbered chests.
- Counting the number of odd and even numbered keys.
- Maximizing the number of pairs where the sum of the chest and key numbers is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def max_chests_opened(n, m, a, b):
    # Count the number of odd and even numbered chests and keys
    count_a = Counter([num % 2 for num in a])
    count_b = Counter([num % 2 for num in b])
    
    # Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened
    max_opened = min(count_a[1], count_b[0]) + min(count_a[0], count_b[1])
    
    return max_opened

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, m) = readlist()
    a = readlist()
    b = readlist()
    print(max_chests_opened(n, m, a, b))
```

This corrected version uses the `Counter` class to count the number of odd and even numbers in both the chests and keys. It then calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by pairing the appropriate counts of odd and even numbers.
