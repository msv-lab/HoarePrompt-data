Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle overlapping segments that share the same endpoints. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
1 3
2 3
3 5
```

According to the problem description, we expect the output to be `7 2 1`, because:
- Points `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` are covered by one segment.
- Points `[3]` are covered by two segments.
- Point `[3]` is covered by three segments.

However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate the number of points covered by two and three segments. The program does not properly account for overlapping segments that share the same endpoints, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the segment from `2` to `3` overlaps with the segment from `3` to `5`, but the program might not correctly handle this overlap, leading to an incorrect count of points covered by two and three segments.

To fix this issue, the program needs to properly handle overlapping segments, especially those with shared endpoints.
