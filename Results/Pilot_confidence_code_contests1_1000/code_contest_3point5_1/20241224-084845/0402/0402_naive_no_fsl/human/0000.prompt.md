You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Little Elephant has got a problem — somebody has been touching his sorted by non-decreasing array a of length n and possibly swapped some elements of the array.

The Little Elephant doesn't want to call the police until he understands if he could have accidentally changed the array himself. He thinks that he could have accidentally changed array a, only if array a can be sorted in no more than one operation of swapping elements (not necessarily adjacent). That is, the Little Elephant could have accidentally swapped some two elements.

Help the Little Elephant, determine if he could have accidentally changed the array a, sorted by non-decreasing, himself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the size of array a. The next line contains n positive integers, separated by single spaces and not exceeding 109, — array a.

Note that the elements of the array are not necessarily distinct numbers.

Output

In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if the Little Elephant could have accidentally changed the array himself, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3
3 2 1


Output

YES


Input

4
4 3 2 1


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample the array has already been sorted, so to sort it, we need 0 swap operations, that is not more than 1. Thus, the answer is "YES".

In the second sample we can sort the array if we swap elements 1 and 3, so we need 1 swap operation to sort the array. Thus, the answer is "YES".

In the third sample we can't sort the array in more than one swap operation, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            k += 1
    if k <= 2:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
