Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps required to throw away all weights according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of steps is flawed.

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, Duff should be able to throw away all three weights in one step since their sum (2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 12) is not a power of two, but the sum of any two weights is a power of two (2^2 + 2^2 = 8).

However, the program will output:
```
1
```

This is incorrect because Duff can throw away the first two weights in one step (since 2^2 + 2^2 = 8, which is a power of two), and then throw away the third weight in a second step. Therefore, the correct output should be `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility of combining weights to form a power of two in a more sophisticated manner, rather than simply counting the number of odd counts in the frequency array.
