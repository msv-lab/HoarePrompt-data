Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to use a Sprague-Grundy theorem approach, but the implementation is flawed. Let's analyze why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `input()` which expects a string. However, the problem specifies that the input should be an integer. This mismatch could cause issues, but it doesn't directly affect the logic for determining the winner.

2. **Game Logic Implementation**: The core issue lies in how the program determines the winning strategy. The program attempts to calculate the Grundy number for each possible pile size and uses this to determine if Serozha can force a win. However, the logic to determine the Grundy number and the moves available is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the calculation of `movs` and the determination of the minimum excluded value (mex) are incorrect.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer should be `2` because Serozha can split the pile into `2` and `1` and force Gena into a losing position.
   - For `n = 6`, the correct answer is `-1` because no matter how Serozha splits the pile, Gena can always respond in such a way that Serozha eventually loses.
   - For `n = 100`, the correct answer is `8` because Serozha can split the pile in a way that forces Gena into a losing position.

Given the examples provided in the problem statement, the program fails to produce the correct outputs for these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
