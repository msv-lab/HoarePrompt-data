You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima's got a staircase that consists of n stairs. The first stair is at height a1, the second one is at a2, the last one is at an (1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an). 

Dima decided to play with the staircase, so he is throwing rectangular boxes at the staircase from above. The i-th box has width wi and height hi. Dima throws each box vertically down on the first wi stairs of the staircase, that is, the box covers stairs with numbers 1, 2, ..., wi. Each thrown box flies vertically down until at least one of the two following events happen:

  * the bottom of the box touches the top of a stair; 
  * the bottom of the box touches the top of a box, thrown earlier. 



We only consider touching of the horizontal sides of stairs and boxes, at that touching with the corners isn't taken into consideration. Specifically, that implies that a box with width wi cannot touch the stair number wi + 1.

You are given the description of the staircase and the sequence in which Dima threw the boxes at it. For each box, determine how high the bottom of the box after landing will be. Consider a box to fall after the previous one lands.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of stairs in the staircase. The second line contains a non-decreasing sequence, consisting of n integers, a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109; ai ≤ ai + 1).

The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of boxes. Each of the following m lines contains a pair of integers wi, hi (1 ≤ wi ≤ n; 1 ≤ hi ≤ 109) — the size of the i-th thrown box.

The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.

Output

Print m integers — for each box the height, where the bottom of the box will be after landing. Print the answers for the boxes in the order, in which the boxes are given in the input.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

def func():
    input = raw_input
    m = int(input())
    a = map(int, input().split())
    cur_h = 0
    n = int(input())
    for i in xrange(n):
        (w, h) = map(int, input().split())
        ch = a[w - 1]
        if ch > cur_h:
            print(ch)
            cur_h = ch + h
        else:
            print(cur_h)
            cur_h += h

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
