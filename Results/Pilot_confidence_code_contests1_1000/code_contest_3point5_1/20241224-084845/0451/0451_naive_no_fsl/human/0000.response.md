Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the width of a box exceeds the current stair index. Specifically, the line `ch = a[w - 1]` assumes that the box width `w` is always within the bounds of the stairs, which is not always true according to the problem description. The description states that a box with width `wi` cannot touch the stair number `wi + 1`, meaning that `wi` can be equal to `n`.

Consider the following input:
```
5
1 2 3 6 6
4
1 1
3 1
4 1
5 1
```

For the fourth box with width 4 and height 1, the program will incorrectly calculate the bottom height of the box as `a[3]` (which is 6), instead of handling the case where the box width exceeds the number of stairs. This results in an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the box width does not exceed the number of stairs available. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import print_function, division

def func():
    input = raw_input
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cur_h = 0
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        w, h = map(int, input().split())
        # Ensure the box width does not exceed the number of stairs
        ch = a[min(w - 1, n - 1)]
        if ch > cur_h:
            print(ch)
            cur_h = ch + h
        else:
            print(cur_h)
            cur_h += h

func()
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
