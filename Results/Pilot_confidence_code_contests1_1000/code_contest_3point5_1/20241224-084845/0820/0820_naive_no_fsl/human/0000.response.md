Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
2
2
01
01
```

In this case, the strings `a` and `b` are already identical, so no operations should be needed. However, the current implementation includes a loop that iterates over the entire string in reverse, leading to unnecessary operations. This results in the output being `0`, which is correct but the approach taken is flawed.

To fix this, the program should check if `a` is already equal to `b` before proceeding with the operations. Here's a corrected version of the `func_7` function:

```python
def func_7(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return []  # No operations needed
    
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        flips += 1
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
    return out
```

With this modification, the program will correctly identify that no operations are needed when `a` and `b` are already the same, avoiding unnecessary operations and ensuring the program works correctly for all cases.
