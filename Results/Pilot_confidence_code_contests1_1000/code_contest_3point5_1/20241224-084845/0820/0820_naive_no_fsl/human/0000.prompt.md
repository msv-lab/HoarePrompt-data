You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.

For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.

Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 1000) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 3n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.

9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5

Note

In the first test case, we have 01→ 11→ 00→ 10.

In the second test case, we have 01011→ 00101→ 11101→ 01000→ 10100→ 00100→ 11100.

In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length 2, which will leave a unchanged.
Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys

try:
    inp = raw_input
except:
    inp = input
T = func_2()
for _ in range(T):
    N = func_2()
    a = list(inp())
    b = list(inp())
    out = func_7(a, b)
    print(' '.join(map(str, [len(out)] + out)))

def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

def func_2():
    return int(inp())

def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]

def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'

def func_5(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[0]
    else:
        return func_4(a[-1])

def func_6(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[-1]
    else:
        return func_4(a[0])

def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        flips += 1
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
    return out

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
