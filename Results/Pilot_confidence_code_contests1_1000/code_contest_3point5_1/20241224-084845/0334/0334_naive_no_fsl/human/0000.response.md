Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in handling the case where `n` (the number of cubes) is 1. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the single cube does not have the necessary digits to form numbers greater than 1. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
1
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

The program should output `0` because there is no way to form the number `1`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `9` because it does not properly check if the single cube has the digit `1`.

To fix this, the condition for `n == 1` should be modified to explicitly check if the digit `1` is present on the cube before proceeding to check other numbers.
