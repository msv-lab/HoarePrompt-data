Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program uses two helper functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to generate the coefficients needed for the alternating addition and subtraction process. 

- `func_1` generates the necessary coefficients for the given modulo `p`.
- `func_2` uses these coefficients to create the sequence of numbers that will be multiplied by the input array elements during the reduction process.

The main function reads the input, calculates the required coefficients using `func_2`, and then performs the alternating addition and subtraction as described. The final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the complexity of the problem and the provided examples, the program seems to handle various edge cases and general cases correctly. Since no specific issues or counterexamples were found, the program appears to be correct.
