Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program uses a precomputed string `s` up to a certain point (`P = 28342`), but it does not account for queries beyond this point. Given the problem description, the sequence can extend infinitely, and the program should handle queries for any value of `k` up to \(10^9\). However, the program only computes and stores the string up to `P = 28342`, which means it will fail for any query `k > 28342`.

For example, consider the input `k = 1000000000`. Since `1000000000` is far beyond the precomputed length of `s`, the program will not correctly find the digit at this position. This indicates that the program is not correct for every potential case.
