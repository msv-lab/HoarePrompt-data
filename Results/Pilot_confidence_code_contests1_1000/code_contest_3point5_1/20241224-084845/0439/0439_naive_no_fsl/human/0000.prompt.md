You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of k.

You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345..." which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from 1 to 1, the second one — from 1 to 2, the third one — from 1 to 3, ..., the i-th block consists of all numbers from 1 to i. 

So the first 56 elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the 1-st element of the sequence is 1, the 3-rd element of the sequence is 2, the 20-th element of the sequence is 5, the 38-th element is 2, the 56-th element of the sequence is 0.

Your task is to answer q independent queries. In the i-th query you are given one integer k_i. Calculate the digit at the position k_i of the sequence.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

The i-th of the following q lines contains one integer k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9) — the description of the corresponding query.

Output

Print q lines. In the i-th line print one digit x_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ 9) — the answer to the query i, i.e. x_i should be equal to the element at the position k_i of the sequence.

Note

Answers on queries from the first example are described in the problem statement.
Program:
```
s = ''
for i in range(1, 28342):
    s += str(i)
P = 28342
dp = [0] * P
for i in range(1, 10):
    dp[i] = i
for i in range(10, 100):
    dp[i] = (i - 9) * 2 + 9
prev = dp[99]
for i in range(100, 1000):
    dp[i] = (i - 99) * 3 + dp[99]
for i in range(1000, 10000):
    dp[i] = (i - 999) * 4 + dp[999]
for i in range(10000, P):
    dp[i] = (i - 9999) * 5 + dp[i - 9999]
for i in range(1, P):
    dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
for _ in range(int(raw_input())):
    k = int(raw_input())
    lo = 0
    hi = P - 1
    while lo <= hi:
        mi = lo + hi >> 1
        if dp[mi] == k:
            ans = mi
            break
        if dp[mi] <= k:
            ans = mi
            lo = mi + 1
        else:
            hi = mi - 1
    mi = ans
    rem = k - dp[mi]
    print(func_1(rem - 1))

def func_1(n):
    return s[n]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
