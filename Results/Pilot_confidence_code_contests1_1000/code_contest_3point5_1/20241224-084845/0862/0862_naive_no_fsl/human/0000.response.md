Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality to generate a good permutation according to the problem description. The function `func_7` calculates combinations, which is unrelated to generating a good permutation. The other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, and `func_6`) do not contribute to solving the problem either.

A good permutation can be constructed by simply setting each element to its position in the sequence. For example, for `n = 3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is good because for any subarray, the bitwise OR of the elements will be at least the length of the subarray. However, the provided code does not generate any permutation and thus fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
