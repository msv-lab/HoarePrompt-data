You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

For a positive integer n, we call a permutation p of length n good if the following condition holds for every pair i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) — 

  * (p_i  OR  p_{i+1}  OR  …  OR  p_{j-1}  OR  p_{j}) ≥ j-i+1, where OR denotes the [bitwise OR operation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR)



In other words, a permutation p is good if for every subarray of p, the OR of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. 

Given a positive integer n, output any good permutation of length n. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of every test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

Output

For every test, output any good permutation of length n on a separate line. 

Example

Input


3
1
3
7


Output


1
3 1 2
4 3 5 2 7 1 6

Note

For n = 3, [3,1,2] is a good permutation. Some of the subarrays are listed below. 

  * 3 OR 1 = 3 ≥ 2 (i = 1,j = 2) 
  * 3 OR 1 OR 2 = 3 ≥ 3 (i = 1,j = 3) 
  * 1 OR 2 = 3 ≥ 2 (i = 2,j = 3) 
  * 1 ≥ 1 (i = 2,j = 2) 



Similarly, you can verify that [4,3,5,2,7,1,6] is also good.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
import sys
import math
from math import sqrt, floor, ceil
from collections import Counter
from copy import deepcopy as dc

input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(input())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])

def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')

def func_6(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    ans = []
    i = 2
    cap = sqrt(n)
    while i <= cap:
        if n % i == 0:
            ans.append(i)
            n = n // i
            cap = sqrt(n)
        else:
            i += 1
    if n > 1:
        ans.append(n)
    return ans

def func_7(n, k):
    if n == 1 or n == k:
        return 1
    if k > n:
        return 0
    else:
        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
