Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the probability that Jerry's total sum is strictly higher than Andrew's total sum given the conditions of the game. Specifically, the program seems to attempt to calculate some form of probability distribution but does not accurately model the problem described.

The main issues are:
1. The program attempts to pre-calculate differences between pairs of numbers and their frequencies, which is not necessary for solving the current problem.
2. The program's logic for calculating the probability does not correctly account for the specific conditions where Jerry needs to win the third round and have a higher total sum than Andrew.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
3
1 2 10
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0.0740740741
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
0.0000000000
```

This discrepancy arises because the program does not correctly simulate the scenario where Jerry wins the third round and still has a chance to have a higher total sum than Andrew. The program's approach of pre-calculating differences and their frequencies is not aligned with the problem's requirement to calculate the probability under the specific conditions mentioned.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect.
