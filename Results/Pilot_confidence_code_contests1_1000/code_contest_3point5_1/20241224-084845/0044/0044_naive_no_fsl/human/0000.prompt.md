You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a program of the Selection Sort algorithm which sorts a sequence A in ascending order. The algorithm should be based on the following pseudocode:


SelectionSort(A)
1 for i = 0 to A.length-1
2     mini = i
3     for j = i to A.length-1
4         if A[j] < A[mini]
5             mini = j
6     swap A[i] and A[mini]


Note that, indices for array elements are based on 0-origin.

Your program should also print the number of swap operations defined in line 6 of the pseudocode in the case where i ≠ mini.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Input

The first line of the input includes an integer N, the number of elements in the sequence.

In the second line, N elements of the sequence are given separated by space characters.

Output

The output consists of 2 lines.

In the first line, please print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character.

In the second line, please print the number of swap operations.

Examples

Input

6
5 6 4 2 1 3


Output

1 2 3 4 5 6
4


Input

6
5 2 4 6 1 3


Output

1 2 3 4 5 6
3
Program:
```
n = input()
a = map(int, raw_input().split())
ct = func_2(a, n)
func_1(a, n)
print(ct)

def func_1(a, n):
    li = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        li.append(str(a[i]))
    print(' '.join(li))

def func_2(a, n):
    ct = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        if i == n - 1:
            break
        else:
            mini = i
            for j in xrange(i, n, 1):
                if a[j] < a[mini]:
                    mini = j
            if i != mini:
                keep = a[i]
                a[i] = a[mini]
                a[mini] = keep
                ct += 1
    return ct


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
