Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Selection Sort algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is responsible for printing the sorted sequence, but it does not actually perform the sorting. Instead, it prints the original sequence passed to it. Additionally, the function `func_2` does not correctly swap elements when necessary. The swapping logic is placed inside the inner loop, which is not consistent with the pseudocode provided. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the current element only after the inner loop completes for each `i`.

To fix this, the swapping should be done outside the inner loop, after determining the minimum index. Here is a corrected version:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
ct = func_2(a, n)
func_1(a, n)
print(ct)

def func_1(a, n):
    print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

def func_2(a, n):
    ct = 0
    for i in range(n):
        mini = i
        for j in range(i, n):
            if a[j] < a[mini]:
                mini = j
        if i != mini:
            a[i], a[mini] = a[mini], a[i]
            ct += 1
    return ct
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is sorted and the number of swaps is correctly counted and printed.
