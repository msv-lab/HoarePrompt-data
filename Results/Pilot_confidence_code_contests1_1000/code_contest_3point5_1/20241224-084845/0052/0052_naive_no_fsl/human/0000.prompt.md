You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice is playing with some stones.

Now there are three numbered heaps of stones. The first of them contains a stones, the second of them contains b stones and the third of them contains c stones.

Each time she can do one of two operations:

  1. take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap (this operation can be done only if the first heap contains at least one stone and the second heap contains at least two stones); 
  2. take one stone from the second heap and two stones from the third heap (this operation can be done only if the second heap contains at least one stone and the third heap contains at least two stones). 



She wants to get the maximum number of stones, but she doesn't know what to do. Initially, she has 0 stones. Can you help her?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Next t lines describe test cases in the following format:

Line contains three non-negative integers a, b and c, separated by spaces (0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100) — the number of stones in the first, the second and the third heap, respectively.

In hacks it is allowed to use only one test case in the input, so t = 1 should be satisfied.

Output

Print t lines, the answers to the test cases in the same order as in the input. The answer to the test case is the integer — the maximum possible number of stones that Alice can take after making some operations. 

Example

Input


3
3 4 5
1 0 5
5 3 2


Output


9
0
6

Note

For the first test case in the first test, Alice can take two stones from the second heap and four stones from the third heap, making the second operation two times. Then she can take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap, making the first operation one time. The summary number of stones, that Alice will take is 9. It is impossible to make some operations to take more than 9 stones, so the answer is 9.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for i in xrange(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        k2 = min(b / 1, c / 2)
        b -= 1 * k2
        c -= 2 * k2
        k1 = min(a / 1, b / 2)
        a -= 1 * k1
        b -= 2 * k1
        print(k1 + k2) * 3


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
