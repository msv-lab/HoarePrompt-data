Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the program only considers the case where the array length `n` is greater than 1. For the case where `n == 1`, the program still prints an operation which is unnecessary and incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - When `n == 1`, the program still prints an operation:
     ```
     print(1, 1)
     print(0)
     ```
     This is incorrect because there is no segment to operate on, and the output should indicate that no operation is needed.

2. **General Case Analysis:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program handles the case correctly by selecting segments and applying the necessary adjustments.
   - However, for `n == 1`, the program should either skip the operation or explicitly handle it differently.

Given that the program incorrectly prints an operation for `n == 1`, it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
