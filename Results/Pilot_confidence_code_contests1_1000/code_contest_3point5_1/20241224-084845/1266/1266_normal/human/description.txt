Write a program of the Bubble Sort algorithm which sorts a sequence A in ascending order. The algorithm should be based on the following pseudocode:


BubbleSort(A)
1 for i = 0 to A.length-1
2     for j = A.length-1 downto i+1
3         if A[j] < A[j-1]
4             swap A[j] and A[j-1]


Note that, indices for array elements are based on 0-origin.

Your program should also print the number of swap operations defined in line 4 of the pseudocode.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Input

The first line of the input includes an integer N, the number of elements in the sequence.

In the second line, N elements of the sequence are given separated by spaces characters.

Output

The output consists of 2 lines.

In the first line, please print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character.

In the second line, please print the number of swap operations.
