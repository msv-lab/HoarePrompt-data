Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the `Partition` function as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the line `(a[i + 1], a[r]) = (a[r], a[i + 1])` is incorrect. According to the pseudocode, the pivot element `x` should be swapped with `A[i+1]`, but the current implementation incorrectly swaps `A[r]` with itself (`a[r]`), which does not move the pivot to the correct position.

For example, consider the input:
```
12
13 19 9 5 12 8 7 4 21 2 6 11
```

The correct output should be:
```
9 5 8 7 4 2 6 [11] 21 13 19 12
```

However, due to the error in the `Partition` function, the program will produce an incorrect output. This is because the pivot element is not correctly placed in its final position, leading to a mispartitioned array.

To fix this, the line should be changed to:
```python
(a[i + 1], a[r]) = (a[r], a[i + 1])
```
to:
```python
(a[i], a[r]) = (a[r], a[i])
```

After making this correction, the program will correctly implement the partitioning step and produce the expected output.
