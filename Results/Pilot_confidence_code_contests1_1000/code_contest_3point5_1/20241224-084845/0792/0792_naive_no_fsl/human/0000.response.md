Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_10` attempts to calculate the maximum possible sum of subarrays of length `m` chosen in such a way that there are `k` subarrays. However, the implementation is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The array `b` is initialized with only two elements, which does not capture the cumulative sum correctly. It should start from 0 and append the cumulative sums of the array `a`.

2. **Subarray Sum Calculation**: The nested loops in the `d` array calculation do not correctly compute the maximum sum of subarrays of length `m`. The inner loop logic for updating `p` and `dd` is incorrect and does not ensure that the subarrays are disjoint and of length `m`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m` is equal to 1, which should simply sort the array and take the top `k` elements.

To verify this, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
5 2 1
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

However, running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct output due to the flaws mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
