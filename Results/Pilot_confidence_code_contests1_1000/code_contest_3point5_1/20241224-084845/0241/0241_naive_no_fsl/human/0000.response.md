Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area that will be cleared. Specifically, the program attempts to find the minimum and maximum distances from the point \(P\) to the vertices of the polygon, but it does not properly account for the convex hull or the actual shape of the region that will be cleared. The logic for determining the minimum and maximum distances does not consider the polygon's boundary correctly, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 0 0
0 1
1 1
1 0
0 0
```

The expected output should be the area of a circle with radius equal to the maximum distance from the point \(P(0,0)\) to the vertices of the square, minus the area of the smallest circle that can enclose the polygon. However, the program's approach does not correctly calculate this area.

The correct approach involves calculating the distance from the point \(P\) to the closest and farthest points on the boundary of the polygon, and then using these distances to compute the area of the annulus (the difference between the areas of two circles).

Since the provided program does not handle this correctly, it fails to meet the problem description for some cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
