Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Functionality in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to increment the `count` variable when it encounters a bomb (`#`). However, the function parameters are incorrect; it takes `(x, y)` which are coordinates, but the function should take `(x, y)` as indices within the array. Also, the function should only be called if the current cell is an empty square (`.`), and it should only increment `count` if the neighbor cell is a bomb.

2. **Inconsistent Use of Coordinates:**
   - The program uses both 2D coordinates `(x, y)` and indices into the 2D array `arr`. This inconsistency leads to errors. For example, the condition `if y != 0:` should be checking the index bounds rather than the coordinate bounds.

3. **Incorrect Counting Logic:**
   - The counting logic for adjacent bombs is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the adjacency conditions and does not check all possible directions around each empty square.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import numpy as np

(H, W) = map(int, input().split())
arr = np.array([])

for _ in range(H):
    li = list(input())
    li = np.array(li)
    arr = np.hstack((arr, li))

arr = arr.reshape((H, W))

for x in range(H):
    stri = ''
    for y in range(W):
        if arr[x, y] == '.':
            count = 0
            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < H and 0 <= ny < W and arr[nx, ny] == '#':
                        count += 1
            stri += str(count)
        else:
            stri += '#'
    print(stri)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts the number of adjacent bombs for each empty square and handles all edge cases properly.
