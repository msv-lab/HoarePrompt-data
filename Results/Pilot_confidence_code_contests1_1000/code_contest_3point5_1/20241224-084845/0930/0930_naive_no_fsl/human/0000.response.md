Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of zeros (piles with 0 candies) is not balanced between the two halves of the array after sorting. Specifically, the program calculates the number of moves needed to balance the squares and non-squares but does not properly account for the initial number of zeros.

Consider the following input:
```
6
120 110 23 34 25 45
```

The output of the given program is `3`, which is correct. However, consider another case:
```
6
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

For this input, the correct output should be `6` because we need to ensure that exactly 3 piles have a number of candies that is a square of some integer and the remaining 3 piles have a number of candies that is not a square of any integer. However, the program outputs `6`, which is correct in this specific case.

But consider the case:
```
4
0 0 1 1
```

The program would incorrectly output `0` because it does not properly handle the initial number of zeros. We need to add two candies to either the third or fourth pile to make them non-square, and the program fails to recognize this.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
