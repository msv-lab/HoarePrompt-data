You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ann and Borya have n piles with candies and n is even number. There are ai candies in pile with number i.

Ann likes numbers which are square of some integer and Borya doesn't like numbers which are square of any integer. During one move guys can select some pile with candies and add one candy to it (this candy is new and doesn't belong to any other pile) or remove one candy (if there is at least one candy in this pile). 

Find out minimal number of moves that is required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

Input

First line contains one even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — number of piles with candies.

Second line contains sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — amounts of candies in each pile.

Output

Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer. If condition is already satisfied output 0.

Output

Note

In first example you can satisfy condition in two moves. During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).

In second example you should add two candies to any three piles.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    l = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    zero = l.count(0)
    for i in range(n):
        r = round(math.sqrt(l[i]))
        l[i] = abs(l[i] - r * r)
    l.sort()
    rzero = max(0, zero - n // 2)
    print(sum(l[0:n // 2]) + rzero * 2 + l[n // 2:n].count(0) - rzero)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
