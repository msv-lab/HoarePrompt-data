You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
