Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the value of `b_i` is `-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `b_i = -1`, no further additions to `a_{b_i}` should occur. However, the current implementation adds the value of `a[i]` to `a[b[i]]` unconditionally, even when `b[i] = -1`. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where some elements should not be added to their respective positions due to `-1` values in the `b` array.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3
2 3 -1
```

The correct output should be:
```
10
1 2 3
```

However, the program currently outputs:
```
10
1 3 2
```

This happens because the program incorrectly processes the `-1` in the `b` array, leading to the addition of `a[2]` to `a[3]` instead of stopping at `b[2] = -1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
