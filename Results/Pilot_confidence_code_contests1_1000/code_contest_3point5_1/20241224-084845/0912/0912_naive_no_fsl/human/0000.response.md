Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program is attempting to use depth-first search (DFS) to determine the number of connected components in a graph where nodes represent snow drifts and edges represent possible movements between them. However, the implementation of DFS is flawed.

Here’s why the program does not work:

1. **Incorrect Graph Representation**: The program creates two dictionaries `mydict_x` and `mydict_y` to represent connections based on x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately. This approach is incorrect because it does not fully capture the connectivity of the graph. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   1 1
   2 2
   ```

   According to the problem, Bajtek can move in four directions (north, east, south, west). Hence, `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)` should be connected since they are in the same row and column, but the current implementation would treat them as separate components.

2. **Incomplete DFS Traversal**: The DFS function is only considering connections based on the y-coordinates and x-coordinates separately, which means it is not fully exploring all possible connections. For instance, in the above example, `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)` should be connected but are not due to the separate dictionaries.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly represent the graph such that each node can connect to any other node if they share a row or column. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def func_4():
    n = int(func_3())
    lst = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = func_1()
        lst.append((x, y))

    # Create adjacency list
    adj_list = {}
    for (x, y) in lst:
        if x not in adj_list:
            adj_list[x] = []
        if y not in adj_list:
            adj_list[y] = []
        adj_list[x].append((x, y))
        adj_list[y].append((x, y))

    # Find connected components using DFS
    visited = set()
    count_of_components = 0

    def dfs(node):
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            dfs(neighbor)

    for (x, y) in lst:
        if (x, y) not in visited:
            dfs((x, y))
            count_of_components += 1

    print(count_of_components - 1)
```

This corrected version correctly captures all possible connections and should yield the right number of additional snow drifts needed to make the graph fully connected.
