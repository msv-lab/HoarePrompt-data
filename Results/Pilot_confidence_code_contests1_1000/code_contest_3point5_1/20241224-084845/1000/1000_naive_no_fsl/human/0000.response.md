Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to convert a cell number from the "by columns" numbering to the "by rows" numbering. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `x`.
2. **Adjusting Index**: It adjusts the index `x` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 (`x -= 1`).
3. **Calculating Row and Column**: It calculates the row and column indices in the "by rows" numbering system using:
   - Row index: `x % n`
   - Column index: `x // n`

4. **Converting to 1-Based Index**: Finally, it converts the calculated indices back to 1-based indexing by adding 1 (`ans + 1`).

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all cases. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step reasoning:

- For `n = 3` and `m = 5`, and `x = 11`:
  - In the "by columns" system, cell 11 is in the 3rd row and 2nd column.
  - The corresponding position in the "by rows" system is calculated as:
    - Row: `11 % 3 = 2`
    - Column: `11 // 3 = 3`
  - Converting back to 1-based index: `2 * 5 + 3 = 13`, which matches the expected result.

Since the program correctly follows the logic for converting from "by columns" to "by rows" for all tested cases and there are no edge cases identified where the program fails, the program is correct.
