You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Chris is very keen on his toy blocks. His teacher, however, wants Chris to solve more problems, so he decided to play a trick on Chris.

There are exactly s blocks in Chris's set, each block has a unique number from 1 to s. Chris's teacher picks a subset of blocks X and keeps it to himself. He will give them back only if Chris can pick such a non-empty subset Y from the remaining blocks, that the equality holds: 

<image> "Are you kidding me?", asks Chris.

For example, consider a case where s = 8 and Chris's teacher took the blocks with numbers 1, 4 and 5. One way for Chris to choose a set is to pick the blocks with numbers 3 and 6, see figure. Then the required sums would be equal: (1 - 1) + (4 - 1) + (5 - 1) = (8 - 3) + (8 - 6) = 7.

<image>

However, now Chris has exactly s = 106 blocks. Given the set X of blocks his teacher chooses, help Chris to find the required set Y!

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105), the number of blocks in the set X. The next line contains n distinct space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 106), the numbers of the blocks in X.

Note: since the size of the input and output could be very large, don't use slow output techniques in your language. For example, do not use input and output streams (cin, cout) in C++.

Output

In the first line of output print a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 106 - n), the number of blocks in the set Y. In the next line output m distinct space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (1 ≤ yi ≤ 106), such that the required equality holds. The sets X and Y should not intersect, i.e. xi ≠ yj for all i, j (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m). It is guaranteed that at least one solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

    y = set([i for i in range(1, Max + 1) if i not in a])
    while a:
        ele = a.pop()
        sym = Max - ele + 1
        if sym not in a:
            out.append(sym)
        else:
            a.discard(sym)
            while ix <= Max:
                sym = Max - ix + 1
                if ix in y and sym in y:
                    y.discard(sym)
                    y.discard(ix)
                    out.extend([ix, sym])
                    break
                ix += 1
    print('%d\n%s' % (len(out), ' '.join(map(str, out))))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
