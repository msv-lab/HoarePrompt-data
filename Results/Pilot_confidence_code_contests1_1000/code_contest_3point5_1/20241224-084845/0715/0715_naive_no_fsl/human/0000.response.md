Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly address the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of blocks `n` and the set of blocks `X` that Chris's teacher picked. This is handled correctly.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `out` to store the blocks in the set `Y`, the maximum possible value `Max` (which is 1,000,000), and a variable `ix` to iterate through values from 1 to `Max`.

3. **Set Y Creation**: A set `y` is created containing all numbers from 1 to `Max` that are not in `X`. This ensures that `Y` can only contain elements not already in `X`.

4. **Finding Complementary Elements**: The program then iterates over the elements in `X`. For each element `ele` in `X`, it finds its complement `sym` (i.e., `Max - ele + 1`). If `sym` is also in `X`, it removes both `sym` and `ele` from `X` and adds them to `out`. Otherwise, it finds a pair of numbers from `y` that are complementary and adds them to `out`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of elements in `out` followed by the elements themselves.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach seems to cover all necessary steps. It handles the case where `X` and `Y` should not intersect and ensures the required equality holds.

Since no specific counterexamples or issues were found after careful examination, the program appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
