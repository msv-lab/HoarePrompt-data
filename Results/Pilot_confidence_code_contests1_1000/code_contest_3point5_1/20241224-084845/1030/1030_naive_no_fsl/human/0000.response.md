Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, it attempts to count the number of divisors of `b` up to its square root, but this approach does not accurately determine the number of distinct values that `([a, b]) / a` can take.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the input `b = 4`. According to the problem description:
- For `a = 1`, `([1, 4]) / 1 = 4`.
- For `a = 2`, `([2, 4]) / 2 = 2`.
- For `a = 4`, `([4, 4]) / 4 = 1`.

So, the distinct values written on the board are `4, 2, 1`, which gives us 3 distinct numbers. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of divisors of `b` (which is 3 for `b = 4`), leading to an incorrect output.

The correct approach involves understanding that `([a, b]) / a` will yield different results based on the factors of `b` and their combinations with `a`. The provided program does not account for these complexities and thus fails to produce the correct output for various inputs.
