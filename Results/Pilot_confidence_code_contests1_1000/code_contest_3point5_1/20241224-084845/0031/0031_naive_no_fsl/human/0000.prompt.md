You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your friend are participating in a TV show "Run For Your Prize".

At the start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is located at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend — at position 106 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.

You know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.

Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.

What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of prizes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 106 - 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 9


Output

8


Input

2
2 999995


Output

5

Note

In the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.

In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    prize_indexes = raw_input()
    prize_indexes = [int(x) for x in prize_indexes.split(' ')]
    my_seconds = 0
    friends_seconds = 0
    for i in prize_indexes:
        if i <= 5 * 10 ** 5:
            my_seconds = i - 1
        else:
            friends_seconds = 10 ** 6 - i
    print(max(my_seconds, friends_seconds))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
