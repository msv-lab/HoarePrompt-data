Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input specifies a digit at a position that is out of bounds for the number of digits specified. Specifically, if `s_i` exceeds `N`, the program will not detect this and will still attempt to construct a number, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 7
2 8
4 2
```

Here, `s_3 = 4`, which is out of bounds for a 3-digit number. The program should output `-1` because no valid 3-digit number can satisfy the given conditions. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and will attempt to construct a number, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, you need to add a check to ensure that all `s_i` values are within the valid range for the given number of digits `N`.
