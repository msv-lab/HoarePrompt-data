Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check if the entire sequence can be made equal to `k` through the allowed operations. Here are a couple of test cases that demonstrate the issue:

1. **Test Case 1**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     5 3
     1 5 2 6 1
     1 6
     6
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     no
     yes
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     no
     yes
     ```
   - Explanation: For the first query, the sequence `[1, 5, 2, 6, 1]` cannot be made equal to `3` because no single subsegment can be made equal to `3`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `no`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     10 3
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     no
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     yes
     ```
   - Explanation: The sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` cannot be made equal to `3` because the median of any subsegment will not consistently yield `3`. The program incorrectly outputs `yes`.

The program should check if the sequence can be made uniform by checking if there exists a subsegment whose median can be `k`. It also needs to ensure that the sequence can be modified to have all elements equal to `k`. The current implementation fails to do this correctly.
