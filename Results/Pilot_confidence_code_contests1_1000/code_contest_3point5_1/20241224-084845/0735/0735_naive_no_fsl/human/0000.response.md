Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. Specifically, it processes the sequences `A` and `B` from the end to the beginning, which can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. The program aims to ensure that each `A_i` is a multiple of `B_i`, but it does not account for dependencies between the increments properly.

Consider the following input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

Expected output:
```
7
```

However, the program's logic might fail to handle the dependency correctly. For instance, if we start from the end:
- For `i = 2`, `A_2 = 2` and `B_2 = 7`. The program calculates the required increment as `b - (a + cnt) % b`, but it doesn't consider the impact of previous increments.
- For `i = 1`, `A_1 = 3` and `B_1 = 5`. The program calculates the required increment based on the current value of `cnt`.

This approach can lead to an overestimation of the required increments. A more accurate approach would be to process the sequences from the beginning to the end, ensuring that each increment is applied to satisfy the condition for the current index before moving to the next.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        while (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that each increment is applied correctly by processing the sequences from the beginning, thus satisfying the condition for each `A_i` to be a multiple of `B_i`.
