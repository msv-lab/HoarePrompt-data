Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the range of temperatures queried (a, b) might include the last segment of temperatures defined by the recipes. Specifically, the code appends `[2 * 10 ** 5 + 2, 2 * 10 ** 5 + 2]` to the `recipes` list, which is meant to mark the end of the temperature range. However, this approach does not correctly account for the last segment of temperatures if the range queried includes temperatures up to `2 * 10 ** 5`.

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 2 1
91 94
92 97
97 99
90 100
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program fails to count the last temperature `100` as admissible because it does not properly handle the last segment of temperatures. The appended segment `[2 * 10 ** 5 + 2, 2 * 10 ** 5 + 2]` is too large and does not accurately represent the end of the valid temperature range. Therefore, the program incorrectly counts the number of admissible temperatures in the query range `[90, 100]`, resulting in `3` instead of `4`.
