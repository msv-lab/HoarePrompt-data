Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all selected segments overlap perfectly, which is a critical edge case. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum possible score by considering each starting point `i` and the segment length `k`, but it does not account for the scenario where the optimal solution might involve overlapping segments perfectly. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6 3
10 -10 10 10 -10 10
```

The correct maximum possible score should be 30, achieved by painting the first three squares and the last three squares black. However, the current implementation may miss this optimal solution because it only considers non-overlapping segments.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly handle the case where the optimal solution involves perfect overlap of segments. This can be done by considering the cumulative sums and finding the maximum prefix sum and suffix sum that can be combined with any segment of length `k`.
