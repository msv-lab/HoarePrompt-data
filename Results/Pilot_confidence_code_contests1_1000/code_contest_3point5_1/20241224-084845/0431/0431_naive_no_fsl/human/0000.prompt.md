You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Three-valued logic is a logic system that has, in addition to "true" and "false", "unknown" as a valid value. In the following, logical values "false", "unknown" and "true" are represented by 0, 1 and 2 respectively.

Let "-" be a unary operator (i.e. a symbol representing one argument function) and let both "*" and "+" be binary operators (i.e. symbols representing two argument functions). These operators represent negation (NOT), conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) respectively. These operators in three-valued logic can be defined in Table C-1.

Table C-1: Truth tables of three-valued logic operators
-X| | (X*Y)| | (X+Y) | <image>|  | <image>|  | <image> |
---|---|---|---|---|---

Let P, Q and R be variables ranging over three-valued logic values. For a given formula, you are asked to answer the number of triples (P,Q,R) that satisfy the formula, that is, those which make the value of the given formula 2. A formula is one of the following form (X and Y represent formulas).

* Constants: 0, 1 or 2
* Variables: P, Q or R
* Negations: -X
* Conjunctions: (X*Y)
* Disjunctions: (X+Y)


Note that conjunctions and disjunctions of two formulas are always parenthesized.

For example, when formula (P*Q) is given as an input, the value of this formula is 2 when and only when (P,Q,R) is (2,2,0), (2,2,1) or (2,2,2). Therefore, you should output 3.

Input

The input consists of one or more lines. Each line contains a formula. A formula is a string which consists of 0, 1, 2, P, Q, R, -, *, +, (, ). Other characters such as spaces are not contained. The grammar of formulas is given by the following BNF.


<formula> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | P | Q | R |
-<formula> | (<formula>*<formula>) | (<formula>+<formula>)


All the formulas obey this syntax and thus you do not have to care about grammatical errors. Input lines never exceed 80 characters.

Finally, a line which contains only a "." (period) comes, indicating the end of the input.

Output

You should answer the number (in decimal) of triples (P,Q,R) that make the value of the given formula 2. One line containing the number should be output for each of the formulas, and no other characters should be output.

Sample Input


(P*Q)
(--R+(P*Q))
(P*-P)
2
1
(-1+(((---P+Q)*(--Q+---R))*(-R+-P)))

            t = reduce(lambda t, e: t.replace(e[0], 'Ternary(%d)' % e[1]), [['0', 0], ['1', 1], ['2', 2], ['P', a], ['Q', b], ['R', c]], s)
            if int(eval(t)) == 2:
                r += 1

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
