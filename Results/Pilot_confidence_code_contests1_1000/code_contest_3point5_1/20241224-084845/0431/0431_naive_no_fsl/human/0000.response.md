Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the three-valued logic operations as described. It uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of values for the variables P, Q, and R (each having 0, 1, or 2 as valid values). For each combination, it substitutes these values into the given formula and evaluates the formula using Python's `eval` function after converting the formula string to use the custom `Ternary` class definitions for negation, conjunction, and disjunction.

The program processes each input line until it encounters a period ("."). It correctly counts and prints the number of valid triples (P, Q, R) that satisfy the given formula for each input. Since the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and correctly evaluates the formulas, it is correct.
