Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the calculation for determining the winner based on the distance `d` and the step size `k` seems flawed. 

Let's consider the test case `(d=10, k=3)`:

- The initial position is `(0,0)`.
- After Ashish's first move, the token can be at `(3,0)` or `(0,3)`.
- From `(3,0)`, Utkarsh can move to `(6,0)`, but this is outside the allowed distance since `6^2 + 0^2 > 10^2`. Thus, Utkarsh cannot make a valid move, and Ashish wins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Utkarsh" for this case. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the winner. The program uses a threshold check that may not accurately reflect the optimal moves for each player.

To fix this, we need a more robust approach to determine the winner based on the game rules. The current implementation does not fully account for all possible moves and their outcomes. A correct solution would involve a more detailed analysis of the game state and optimal strategies for both players.
