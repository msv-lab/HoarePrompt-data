Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the longest subsegment where all elements are equal to the maximum element in the array. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider subsegments where the arithmetic mean is maximized but not necessarily where all elements are the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
6 1 6 6 0
```

The maximum arithmetic mean would be achieved by the subsegment `[3, 4]` which has a mean of \( \frac{6+6}{2} = 6 \). This subsegment is longer than any subsegment where all elements are equal to the maximum value (`6`), which only exists in the first two elements or the last three elements.

The program fails to handle this case correctly and instead outputs `2`, which is the length of the subsegment where the maximum element appears consecutively, but not the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.
