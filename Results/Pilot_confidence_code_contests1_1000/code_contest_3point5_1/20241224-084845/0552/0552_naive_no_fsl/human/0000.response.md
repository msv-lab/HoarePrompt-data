Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to track the number of open gates. Specifically, the variable `NumOfOpenGates` is incremented and decremented based on the presence of a guest at a particular entrance, but it does not accurately reflect the number of open gates at any given time.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
5 1
ABABB
```

The program should output "YES" because the second "B" guest arrives while the first "B" guest is still inside, causing the second "B" gate to be open without a guard. However, the current implementation will output "NO" because it incorrectly handles the counting of open gates.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(k, n, s):
    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    count1 = {}
    count2 = {}
    for ch in alphabet:
        count1[ch] = 0
        count2[ch] = 0
    
    max_open_gates = 0
    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            max_open_gates += 1
        
        if max_open_gates > k:
            return 'Yes'
        
        count2[ch] += 1
        if count2[ch] == count1[ch]:
            max_open_gates -= 1
    
    return 'No'
```

This corrected function keeps track of the maximum number of open gates at any point in time and checks if it exceeds `k`.
