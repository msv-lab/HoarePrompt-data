Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the prefix sums and sorts them, but it does not actually reorder the array elements before computing the query sums. Instead, it directly multiplies the sorted prefix sums with the sorted array elements. This approach does not account for the fact that the array can be reordered to maximize the sum of query replies.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
5 3 2
1 2
2 3
1 3
```

- The program should reorder the array to `[5, 5, 5]` to maximize the sum of query replies.
- The prefix sums would then be `[1, 2, 3]`.
- However, the program does not reorder the array; it just sorts both the array and the prefix sums and multiplies them, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be reordered such that the largest elements are placed in positions that contribute to more queries. The current implementation does not achieve this.
