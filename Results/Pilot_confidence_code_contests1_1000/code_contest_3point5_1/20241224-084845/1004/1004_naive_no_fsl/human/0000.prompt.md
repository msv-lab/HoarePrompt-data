You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.

One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of n elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are q queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers l_i, r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from l_i to r_i, inclusive.

The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.

The next line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the array elements.

Each of the following q lines contains two space-separated integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) — the i-th query.

Output

In a single line print, a single integer — the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    c = [0 for _ in range(n + 3)]
    while q:
        (l, r) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        c[l - 1] += 1
        c[r] -= 1
        q -= 1
    for i in range(len(c)):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        c[i] += c[i - 1]
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        res += arr[i] * c[i]
    print('{}'.format(res))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
