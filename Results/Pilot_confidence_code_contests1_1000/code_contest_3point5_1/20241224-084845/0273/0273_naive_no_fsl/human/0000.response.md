Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `y` is larger than `n - k`. Specifically, the logic to calculate `n1` and generate the list of possible values for `x` is flawed. Here's an example that shows the program's failure:

### Example Case:
- Input: `y = 20`, `k = 7`, `n = 25`

### Expected Output:
According to the problem description, the total number of potatoes `(x + y)` should be divisible by `k` and should not exceed `n`. For `y = 20`, `k = 7`, and `n = 25`, the possible values of `x` should be:
- `x + 20` must be divisible by `7`.
- `x + 20` must be <= `25`.

The valid values for `x` are:
- `x = 5` because `5 + 20 = 25` which is divisible by `7` and <= `25`.

However, the program does not produce this output. Let's analyze the code:

1. `n1 = int(y / k)`: This calculates the quotient of `y` divided by `k`.
2. `n1 = (n1 + 1) * k`: This calculates the next multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `y`.
3. If `n1 >= n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `n1 - y` and generates a list of possible values for `x` from `n1 - y` to `n - y` with a step of `k`.

Given `y = 20`, `k = 7`, and `n = 25`:
- `n1 = int(20 / 7) = 2` (since `20 // 7 = 2`)
- `n1 = (2 + 1) * 7 = 21`
- Since `21 < 25`, the program continues.
- `n1 - y = 21 - 20 = 1`
- The range is `range(1, 25 - 20 + 1, 7)`, which is `range(1, 6, 7)`, but this is incorrect as it does not include `5`.

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate the minimum value of `x` such that `(x + y)` is divisible by `k` and `x + y <= n`.
- Generate the list of possible values for `x` from this minimum value up to the maximum value satisfying the conditions.

Thus, the program fails to correctly generate the list of possible values for `x` in some cases, leading to the incorrect output.
