Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the `UnionFind` class is used to manage the connections between cities. Specifically, the `UnionFind` class implementation provided seems incomplete and lacks key methods such as `unite` and `isSameGroup`. Additionally, the `Bit` class (for Binary Indexed Tree) is declared but not implemented, which is necessary for the solution to work correctly.

Given these issues, the program will likely fail to correctly calculate the minimum possible total cost to connect all cities. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
