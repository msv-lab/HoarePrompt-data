Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the distribution of numbers that are multiples of 2 but not 4. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, the objective is to permute the elements such that the product of each pair of adjacent elements is a multiple of 4. In this case, we can achieve the objective by permuting the array to `[2, 2, 2]`, but the program will incorrectly output `No` because it only checks the counts of odd numbers and multiples of 4, without considering the distribution of numbers that are multiples of 2 but not 4.

The program should check if there are enough multiples of 4 and ensure that there are no odd numbers or numbers that are only multiples of 2 (but not 4) in an odd count, which could prevent achieving the objective.
