Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the 7-bit signals for displaying the given digits on a 7-segment display. The program reads an integer `n` and then enters a loop where it initializes `e` to 0 but never uses it. Additionally, the program reads digits but does not process them to generate the required 7-bit signals.

To verify this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
0
5
1
```

Expected Output:
```
0111111
1010010
1101011
```

However, the provided program will output nothing because it does not process the input digits to generate the required 7-bit signals. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
