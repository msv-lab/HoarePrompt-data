Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Operations**: The `func_1` function (which is supposed to perform path compression) is not being used correctly. It should be called recursively until the root node is found, but it does not perform union operations properly. The `func_1` function should also update the parent and size of nodes during union operations.

2. **Count Calculation**: The variable `count` is initially set to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, which is the total number of possible pairs of islands. However, this calculation is not updated correctly after each union operation. The count should decrease only when the union of two components actually reduces the number of disconnected pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def find(parent, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    rootX = find(parent, x)
    rootY = find(parent, y)
    
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        elif rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX] += 1

def calculate_inconvenience(n, m, edges):
    parent = list(range(n + 1))
    rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    count = n * (n - 1) // 2
    
    result = []
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = edges[i]
        rootA = find(parent, a)
        rootB = find(parent, b)
        
        if rootA != rootB:
            count -= (rank[rootA] + 1) * (rank[rootB] + 1)
            union(parent, rank, a, b)
        
        result.append(count)
    
    return result[::-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = calculate_inconvenience(n, m, edges)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version uses proper union-find with path compression and union by rank to ensure that the number of disconnected pairs is calculated correctly after each bridge collapse.
