You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N islands and M bridges.

The i-th bridge connects the A_i-th and B_i-th islands bidirectionally.

Initially, we can travel between any two islands using some of these bridges.

However, the results of a survey show that these bridges will all collapse because of aging, in the order from the first bridge to the M-th bridge.

Let the inconvenience be the number of pairs of islands (a, b) (a < b) such that we are no longer able to travel between the a-th and b-th islands using some of the bridges remaining.

For each i (1 \leq i \leq M), find the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i < B_i \leq N
* All pairs (A_i, B_i) are distinct.
* The inconvenience is initially 0.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
\vdots
A_M B_M


Output

In the order i = 1, 2, ..., M, print the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses. Note that the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.

    rb = func_1(b)
    if ra != rb:
        sa = size[ra]
        sb = size[rb]
        count -= sa * sb
        par[rb] = ra
        size[ra] += sb
for i in reversed(rev_ans):
    print(i)

def func_1(_i):
    if par[_i] == _i:
        return _i
    else:
        return func_1(par[_i])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
