You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak has n colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered 1 through n, from left to right. There are n possible colors, also numbered 1 through n. The i-th ball has color ti.

For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.

There are <image> non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of balls.

The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ n) where ti is the color of the i-th ball.

Output

Print n integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where i is a dominant color.

Examples

Input

4
1 2 1 2


Output

7 3 0 0 


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

6 0 0 

Note

In the first sample, color 2 is dominant in three intervals:

  * An interval [2, 2] contains one ball. This ball's color is 2 so it's clearly a dominant color. 
  * An interval [4, 4] contains one ball, with color 2 again. 
  * An interval [2, 4] contains two balls of color 2 and one ball of color 1. 



There are 7 more intervals and color 1 is dominant in all of them.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    balls = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    domination = (n + 1) * [0]
    class Color:
    
        def __init__(self, id):
            self.id = id
            self.heap_pos = None
    colors = [Color(color) for color in range(n + 1)]
    for start in range(n):
        for color in colors:
            color.count = 0
        max_count = 0
        best_color = colors[1]
        for i in range(start, n):
            color = colors[balls[i]]
            color.count += 1
            if color.count == max_count:
                if color.id < best_color.id:
                    best_color = color
            elif color.count > max_count:
                max_count = color.count
                best_color = color
            domination[best_color.id] += 1
    print(' '.join(map(str, domination[1:])))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
