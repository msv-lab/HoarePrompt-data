Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that violate the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Order of Input Parameters**: The program uses `D.date(d, e, f) - D.date(a, b, c)` which calculates the difference from the second date to the first date. According to the problem description, the result should be the number of days from the first date to the second date. Therefore, the expression should be `D.date(a, b, c) - D.date(d, e, f)`.

2. **Invalid Date Handling**: The `D.date()` constructor raises a `ValueError` if the input date is invalid (e.g., February 30th). However, the program does not handle this error gracefully. Instead of providing the correct number of days, it will throw an exception. For instance, if the input is `2006 9 2 2006 9 30`, the program will raise an error because September does not have 30 days.

To fix these issues, the corrected program should look like this:

```python
import datetime as D

def func():
    while 1:
        (a, b, c, d, e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        if any(x < 0 for x in [a, b, c, d, e, f]):
            break
        try:
            delta = D.date(d, e, f) - D.date(a, b, c)
            print(delta.days)
        except ValueError:
            # Handle invalid date input
            print("Invalid date")
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs and handle invalid dates gracefully.
