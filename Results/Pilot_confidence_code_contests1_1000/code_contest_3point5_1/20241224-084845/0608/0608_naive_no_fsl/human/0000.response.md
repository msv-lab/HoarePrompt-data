Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The line `[x, d] = input().slice()` is incorrect because `input().slice()` is not a valid Python function. It should be replaced with appropriate methods like `.split()` to parse the input.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Updating Coordinates**: The logic for updating the coordinates `t` and `y` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for updating these coordinates do not correctly reflect the placement instructions. For instance, when `d == 0`, the square should be placed to the left of the previous square, but the current implementation subtracts 1 from `y`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Width and Height**: The variables `ht`, `lt`, `hy`, and `ly` are not updated correctly to determine the maximum and minimum values of `t` and `y`. The logic for updating these variables should ensure that they capture the bounding box of the entire artwork.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    while True:
        N = int(input())
        if N == 0:
            break
        t = [0]
        y = [0]
        for _ in range(1, N):
            n, d = map(int, input().split())
            if d == 0:
                t.append(t[n])
                y.append(y[n] - 1)
            elif d == 1:
                t.append(t[n] - 1)
                y.append(y[n])
            elif d == 2:
                t.append(t[n])
                y.append(y[n] + 1)
            elif d == 3:
                t.append(t[n] + 1)
                y.append(y[n])
        
        # Calculate width and height
        ht = max(t) - min(t) + 1
        hy = max(y) - min(y) + 1
        
        print(ht, hy)

func()
```

This corrected version properly parses the input, updates the coordinates based on the placement instructions, and calculates the width and height correctly.
