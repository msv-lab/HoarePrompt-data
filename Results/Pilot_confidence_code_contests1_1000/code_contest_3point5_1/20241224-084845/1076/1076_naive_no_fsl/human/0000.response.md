Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not seem to implement the logic required to generate a permutation of the string `a` that maximizes the time for Anton's body to revert his DNA. Instead, the program seems to be solving a different problem related to factorials and prime numbers, which is not relevant to the problem description.

Specifically, the program includes functions for calculating factorials, prime numbers, greatest common divisors, and other operations that do not relate to the DNA permutation problem. The main function `func_6()` attempts to rearrange the string `a` into some order but does not follow the logic needed to maximize the number of swaps required to revert the string to its original form.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- Input: `ANTON`
- Expected Output: A string like `NNOTA`, which requires 7 swaps to revert to `ANTON`.
- Actual Output: The program does not produce a valid output that maximizes the number of swaps.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description and fails to produce the correct output for the given examples, the correctness is **False**.
