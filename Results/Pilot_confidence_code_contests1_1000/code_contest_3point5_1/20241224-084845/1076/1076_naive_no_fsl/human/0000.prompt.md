You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After rejecting 10^{100} data structure problems, Errorgorn is very angry at Anton and decided to kill him.

Anton's DNA can be represented as a string a which only contains the characters "ANTON" (there are only 4 distinct characters). 

Errorgorn can change Anton's DNA into string b which must be a permutation of a. However, Anton's body can defend against this attack. In 1 second, his body can swap 2 adjacent characters of his DNA to transform it back to a. Anton's body is smart and will use the minimum number of moves.

To maximize the chance of Anton dying, Errorgorn wants to change Anton's DNA the string that maximizes the time for Anton's body to revert his DNA. But since Errorgorn is busy making more data structure problems, he needs your help to find the best string B. Can you help him?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000) — the number of testcases.

The first and only line of each testcase contains 1 string a (1 ≤ |a| ≤ 100000). a consists of only the characters "A", "N", "O" and "T".

It is guaranteed that the sum of |a| over all testcases does not exceed 100000.

Output

For each testcase, print a single string, b. If there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them. b must be a permutation of the string a.

Example

Input


4
ANTON
NAAN
AAAAAA
OAANTTON


Output


NNOTA
AANN
AAAAAA
TNNTAOOA

Note

For the first testcase, it takes 7 seconds for Anton's body to transform NNOTA to ANTON: 

NNOTA → NNOAT → NNAOT → NANOT → NANTO → ANNTO → ANTNO → ANTON. 

Note that you cannot output strings such as AANTON, ANTONTRYGUB, AAAAA and anton as it is not a permutation of ANTON.

For the second testcase, it takes 2 seconds for Anton's body to transform AANN to NAAN. Note that other strings such as NNAA and ANNA will also be accepted.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
