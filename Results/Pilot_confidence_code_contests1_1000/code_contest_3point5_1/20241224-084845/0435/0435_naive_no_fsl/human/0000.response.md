Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in `func_2` where it calculates the minimum number of bags required by considering both the original order and the reverse order of the input array `a`. However, the problem statement specifies that the garbage must be disposed of on the day it was produced or the next day, but it does not specify that the order of disposal should be considered from both directions. The reverse order consideration in `func_2` might lead to an incorrect result in some cases.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 2
1 0 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- On the first day, Vasya produces 1 unit of garbage. He can dispose of it on the same day or the next day.
- On the second day, Vasya produces 0 units of garbage, so no bag is needed.
- On the third day, Vasya produces 1 unit of garbage. He can dispose of it on the same day or the next day.

The optimal solution is to dispose of the garbage produced on the first and third days on the same day, using only 2 bags.

However, the program considers both the original and reversed order, which leads to an incorrect result:
```
func_1(a, k) = 2
func_1(a[::-1], k) = 2
Minimum of both = 2
```

This seems correct in this specific case, but the program incorrectly handles the logic of considering both orders. To ensure correctness, the program should only consider the original order of the input array.
