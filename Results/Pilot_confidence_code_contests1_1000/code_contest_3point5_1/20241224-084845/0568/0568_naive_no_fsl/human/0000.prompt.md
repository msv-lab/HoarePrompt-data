You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Medicine faculty of Berland State University has just finished their admission campaign. As usual, about 80\% of applicants are girls and majority of them are going to live in the university dormitory for the next 4 (hopefully) years.

The dormitory consists of n rooms and a single mouse! Girls decided to set mouse traps in some rooms to get rid of the horrible monster. Setting a trap in room number i costs c_i burles. Rooms are numbered from 1 to n.

Mouse doesn't sit in place all the time, it constantly runs. If it is in room i in second t then it will run to room a_i in second t + 1 without visiting any other rooms inbetween (i = a_i means that mouse won't leave room i). It's second 0 in the start. If the mouse is in some room with a mouse trap in it, then the mouse get caught into this trap.

That would have been so easy if the girls actually knew where the mouse at. Unfortunately, that's not the case, mouse can be in any room from 1 to n at second 0.

What it the minimal total amount of burles girls can spend to set the traps in order to guarantee that the mouse will eventually be caught no matter the room it started from?

Input

The first line contains as single integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the dormitory.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^4) — c_i is the cost of setting the trap in room number i.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — a_i is the room the mouse will run to the next second after being in room i.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal total amount of burles girls can spend to set the traps in order to guarantee that the mouse will eventually be caught no matter the room it started from.

2 2 2 3 6 7 6


Output

2

Note

In the first example it is enough to set mouse trap in rooms 1 and 4. If mouse starts in room 1 then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it eventually comes to room 4.

In the second example it is enough to set mouse trap in room 2. If mouse starts in room 2 then it gets caught immideately. If mouse starts in any other room then it runs to room 2 in second 1.

Here are the paths of the mouse from different starts from the third example:

  * 1 → 2 → 2 → ...; 
  * 2 → 2 → ...; 
  * 3 → 2 → 2 → ...; 
  * 4 → 3 → 2 → 2 → ...; 
  * 5 → 6 → 7 → 6 → ...; 
  * 6 → 7 → 6 → ...; 
  * 7 → 6 → 7 → ...; 



So it's enough to set traps in rooms 2 and 6.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
