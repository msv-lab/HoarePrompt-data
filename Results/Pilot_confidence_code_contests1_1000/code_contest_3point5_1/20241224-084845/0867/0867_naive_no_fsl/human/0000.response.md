Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the overlap factor calculation. Specifically, the function `func_2(x, y)` has issues with how it handles the bitwise operations and the range checks for the indices. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Bitwise Operations and Range Checks**: The function `func_1` uses bitwise operations to process the binary representation of the table elements. However, the main issue lies in how the function `func_2` processes the shifts and ranges.

2. **Range Check Mismatch**: The condition `if i + x in range(0, nb):` in `func_2` is incorrect. According to the problem description, the condition should be `1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb`. Similarly, the condition for `j + y` should be checked properly.

3. **Bitwise Shift Handling**: The bitwise shift operations in `func_1` and `func_2` are not correctly applied. The function `func_1` uses bitwise AND, OR, and right shift operations to process the binary values, but these operations do not align with the problem's requirement to calculate the overlap factor directly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the overlap factor for all potential shifts. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```

The expected output is `(0, 1)`, but the program may not produce this result due to the incorrect implementation of the overlap factor calculation.

To correct this, the program needs to properly handle the range checks and the bitwise operations to accurately compute the overlap factor.
