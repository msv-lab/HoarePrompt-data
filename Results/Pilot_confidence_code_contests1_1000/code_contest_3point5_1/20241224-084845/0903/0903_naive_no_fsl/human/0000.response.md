Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the tree structure or the operations do not allow for the optimal placement of numbers to maximize the root value. Specifically, the logic in `func_4` for calculating the result for nodes with `max` operations is flawed.

### Issue:
For nodes with a `max` operation, the current implementation tries to maximize the result by subtracting `(nlv - func_4(v))`, which does not correctly reflect the requirement to take the maximum value among its children. Instead, it should directly propagate the maximum value found among its children.

### Example:
Consider the following tree:

```
       1 (max)
      / | \
     2  3  4 (min)
    / \    |
   5   6   7 (max)
```

With the operations:
```
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
```

And the parent array:
```
[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```

The correct output should be `4` because the node `1` (root) should contain the maximum value among its children, which are `2`, `3`, and `4`. The values in the leaves are `5`, `6`, and `7`.

However, the current implementation will not correctly calculate this, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the `max` operations and does not maximize the root value as required. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
