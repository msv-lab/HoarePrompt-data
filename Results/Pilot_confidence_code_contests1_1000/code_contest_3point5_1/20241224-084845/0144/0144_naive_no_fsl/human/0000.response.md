Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a priority queue to find the minimum cost of buying cards that allow jumping to any cell. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current set of card lengths. This is used to check if the GCD of the card lengths is 1, which implies that the player can theoretically jump to any cell. However, the GCD calculation is only performed once per iteration, and it does not properly account for the fact that the player might need to combine different sets of cards to achieve a GCD of 1.

2. **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to explore different combinations of cards, but the logic for pushing new states into the heap is flawed. Specifically, the loop that iterates over the cards and their costs incorrectly handles the union operation, leading to incorrect states being pushed into the heap.

3. **Initial Solution**: The initial solution starts with a tuple `(0, set())`, indicating that no cards have been bought yet. However, this initial state is not correctly handled in the context of the problem, as it does not consider the possibility of buying multiple cards simultaneously.

Given these issues, let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

### Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
3
10 5 15
2 1 3
```

**Expected Output**: 
- The minimal cost should be 3 because buying the card with length 15 and cost 3 would allow jumping to any cell (since 15 is a multiple of both 10 and 5).

However, the provided program will not handle this case correctly. Hereâ€™s why:

- The GCD calculation will fail to recognize that buying the card with length 15 is sufficient.
- The heap-based approach will not explore the combination of buying the card with length 15 and cost 3, as it is designed to explore individual cards rather than combinations.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the case where a single card can achieve the goal of being able to jump to any cell, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
