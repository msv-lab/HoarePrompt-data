Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the total number of clicks required. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of clicks is incorrect. Let's analyze why:

The correct approach to calculate the worst-case number of clicks is to consider that for each question \(i\), in the worst case, Vaganych will make \(i \times (a_i - 1) + 1\) clicks. This is because he may have to retry up to \(a_i - 1\) times before getting the correct answer for each question, and each retry involves re-clicking all previous questions plus the current one.

However, the provided program uses the following formula:
\[ \text{ans} += 1 + (a[i] - 1) \times i \]

This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that after getting a question right, the test moves to the next question without needing additional clicks. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{ans} += i \times a_i \]

To demonstrate this, let's consider the second example given:
- Input: `2\n2 2`
- Expected output: `5`

Using the correct formula:
- For the first question, the worst-case scenario is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) clicks.
- For the second question, the worst-case scenario is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) clicks.
- Total clicks: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

However, the provided program calculates:
- For the first question: \(1 + (2 - 1) \times 1 = 2\) clicks (correct).
- For the second question: \(1 + (2 - 1) \times 2 = 3\) clicks (incorrect).

Thus, the program underestimates the total number of clicks by 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
