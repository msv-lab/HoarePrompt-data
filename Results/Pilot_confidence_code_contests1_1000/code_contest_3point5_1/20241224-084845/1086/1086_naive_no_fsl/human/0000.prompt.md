You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vanya and his friends are walking along the fence of height h and they do not want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than h he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the i-th person is equal to ai.

Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ 1000) — the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2h), the i-th of them is equal to the height of the i-th person.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road.

Examples

Input

3 7
4 5 14


Output

4


Input

6 1
1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

6


Input

6 5
7 6 8 9 10 5


Output

11

Note

In the first sample, only person number 3 must bend down, so the required width is equal to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

In the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 is enough.

In the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11.
Program:
```
def func_1(numberOfFriends, heightOfWall, heightArray):
    if len(heightArray) == numberOfFriends:
        widthCount = 0
        for i in heightArray:
            if i <= heightOfWall:
                widthCount += 1
            else:
                widthCount += 2
    return widthCount


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
