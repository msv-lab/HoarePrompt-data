Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the length of `heightArray` is not equal to `numberOfFriends`. This can lead to incorrect results. For instance, if `heightArray` is shorter or longer than `numberOfFriends`, the function will still attempt to iterate over `heightArray` without checking its length, which can result in unexpected behavior or errors. 

To fix this, the function should include a check to ensure that the length of `heightArray` matches `numberOfFriends`. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
2 7
4 14
```

The function will still attempt to process the heights, even though the length of `heightArray` (2) is less than `numberOfFriends` (which is implied to be 2 in this case but not explicitly checked). This can cause issues if the function is called with different values.

A corrected version of the function should look something like this:

```python
def func_1(numberOfFriends, heightOfWall, heightArray):
    if len(heightArray) != numberOfFriends:
        raise ValueError("Length of heightArray must match numberOfFriends")
    
    widthCount = 0
    for i in heightArray:
        if i <= heightOfWall:
            widthCount += 1
        else:
            widthCount += 2
    return widthCount
```

This ensures that the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs.
