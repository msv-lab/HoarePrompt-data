Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum MEX after each query. Here's a breakdown of why the program appears to handle all cases correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to 0 and creates a dictionary `f` to keep track of elements that are present in the array. It also initializes a list `nex` to store the next available value for each remainder when divided by `x`.

2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, the program updates the `mex` value based on the current query value `a`. It handles three main cases:
   - When `a` equals `mex`, it increments `nex[mex % x]` by `x` and updates `mex` to the next available value.
   - When `mex` is less than `a`, it checks if `(a - mex) % x` is zero. If so, it updates `nex[mex % x]` and increments `mex` accordingly.
   - Otherwise, it updates `nex[a % x]` and increments `mex` accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `mex` might need to be updated based on the `nex` array, ensuring that the `mex` value is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

4. **Output**: The program prints the current `mex` value after each query, which is the maximum possible MEX for the current state of the array.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented in the program, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum MEX for each query. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
