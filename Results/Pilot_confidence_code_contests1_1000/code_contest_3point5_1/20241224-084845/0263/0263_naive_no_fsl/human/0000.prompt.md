You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recall that MEX of an array is a minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. Examples:

  * for the array [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] MEX equals to 3 because numbers 0, 1 and 2 are presented in the array and 3 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array; 
  * for the array [1, 2, 3, 4] MEX equals to 0 because 0 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array; 
  * for the array [0, 1, 4, 3] MEX equals to 2 because 2 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array. 



You are given an empty array a=[] (in other words, a zero-length array). You are also given a positive integer x.

You are also given q queries. The j-th query consists of one integer y_j and means that you have to append one element y_j to the array. The array length increases by 1 after a query.

In one move, you can choose any index i and set a_i := a_i + x or a_i := a_i - x (i.e. increase or decrease any element of the array by x). The only restriction is that a_i cannot become negative. Since initially the array is empty, you can perform moves only after the first query.

You have to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded) of the array if you can perform any number of such operations (you can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).

You have to find the answer after each of q queries (i.e. the j-th answer corresponds to the array of length j).

Operations are discarded before each query. I.e. the array a after the j-th query equals to [y_1, y_2, ..., y_j].

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers q, x (1 ≤ q, x ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries and the value of x.

The next q lines describe queries. The j-th query consists of one integer y_j (0 ≤ y_j ≤ 10^9) and means that you have to append one element y_j to the array.

Output

Print the answer to the initial problem after each query — for the query j print the maximum value of MEX after first j queries. Note that queries are dependent (the array changes after each query) but operations are independent between queries.

Note

In the first example:

  * After the first query, the array is a=[0]: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is 1. 
  * After the second query, the array is a=[0, 1]: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is 2. 
  * After the third query, the array is a=[0, 1, 2]: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is 3. 
  * After the fourth query, the array is a=[0, 1, 2, 2]: you don't need to perform any operations, maximum possible MEX is 3 (you can't make it greater with operations). 
  * After the fifth query, the array is a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0]: you can perform a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 3. The array changes to be a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to 4. 
  * After the sixth query, the array is a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0]: you can perform a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3. The array changes to be a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0]. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to 4. 
  * After the seventh query, the array is a=[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 10]. You can perform the following operations: 
    * a[3] := a[3] + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5, 
    * a[4] := a[4] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3, 
    * a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3, 
    * a[5] := a[5] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6, 
    * a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7, 
    * a[6] := a[6] - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4. 
The resulting array will be a=[0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4]. Now MEX is maximum possible and equals to 7.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
