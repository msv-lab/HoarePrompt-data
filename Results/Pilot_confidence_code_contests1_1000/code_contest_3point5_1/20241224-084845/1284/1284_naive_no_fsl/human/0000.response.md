Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the scenario where the initial configuration of one-way roads already forms a strongly connected graph, meaning that from every city, it is already possible to reach any other city. In such cases, no redirection of roads is needed, and the output should be 0.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
4
1 2 9
2 3 8
3 4 7
4 1 5
```

According to the problem description, since all cities are already reachable from each other without any road redirection, the expected output should be 0. However, the provided program will output 0 only if `minusCost` (which is calculated as the sum of weights of roads that do not need to be redirected) is less than or equal to `totalcost - minusCost`. This condition is not always true and does not guarantee that the smallest amount of money needed to make the graph strongly connected has been found.

A correct solution would involve identifying and redirecting the minimum number of roads to ensure strong connectivity. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
