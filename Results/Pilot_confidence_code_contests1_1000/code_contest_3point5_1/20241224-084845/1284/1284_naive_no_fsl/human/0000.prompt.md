You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nowadays the one-way traffic is introduced all over the world in order to improve driving safety and reduce traffic jams. The government of Berland decided to keep up with new trends. Formerly all n cities of Berland were connected by n two-way roads in the ring, i. e. each city was connected directly to exactly two other cities, and from each city it was possible to get to any other city. Government of Berland introduced one-way traffic on all n roads, but it soon became clear that it's impossible to get from some of the cities to some others. Now for each road is known in which direction the traffic is directed at it, and the cost of redirecting the traffic. What is the smallest amount of money the government should spend on the redirecting of roads so that from every city you can get to any other?

Input

The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — amount of cities (and roads) in Berland. Next n lines contain description of roads. Each road is described by three integers ai, bi, ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 100) — road is directed from city ai to city bi, redirecting the traffic costs ci.

Output

Output single integer — the smallest amount of money the government should spend on the redirecting of roads so that from every city you can get to any other.

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    (source, destination) = ([], [])
    (minusCost, totalcost) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        (s, d, wt) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if s in source or d in destination:
            (s, d) = (d, s)
            minusCost += wt
        totalcost += wt
        source.append(s)
        destination.append(d)
    print(min(minusCost, totalcost - minusCost))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
