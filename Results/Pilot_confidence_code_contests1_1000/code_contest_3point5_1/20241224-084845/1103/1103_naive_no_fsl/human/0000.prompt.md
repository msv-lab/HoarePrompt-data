You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A wise king declared a new calendar. "Tomorrow shall be the first day of the calendar, that is, the day 1 of the month 1 of the year 1. Each year consists of 10 months, from month 1 through month 10, and starts from a big month. A common year shall start with a big month, followed by small months and big months one after another. Therefore the first month is a big month, the second month is a small month, the third a big month, ..., and the 10th and last month a small one. A big month consists of 20 days and a small month consists of 19 days. However years which are multiples of three, that are year 3, year 6, year 9, and so on, shall consist of 10 big months and no small month."

Many years have passed since the calendar started to be used. For celebration of the millennium day (the year 1000, month 1, day 1), a royal lottery is going to be organized to send gifts to those who have lived as many days as the number chosen by the lottery. Write a program that helps people calculate the number of days since their birthdate to the millennium day.

Input

The input is formatted as follows.

> n
>  Y1 M1 D1
>  Y2 M2 D2
>  ...
>  Yn Mn Dn

Here, the first line gives the number of datasets as a positive integer n, which is less than or equal to 100. It is followed by n datasets. Each dataset is formatted in a line and gives three positive integers, Yi (< 1000), Mi (≤ 10), and Di (≤ 20), that correspond to the year, month and day, respectively, of a person's birthdate in the king's calendar. These three numbers are separated by a space.

Output

For the birthdate specified in each dataset, print in a line the number of days from the birthdate, inclusive, to the millennium day, exclusive. Output lines should not contain any character other than this number.

def func():
    if sys.version_info[0] >= 3:
        raw_input = input
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = map(int, raw_input())
        a[0] -= 1
        a[1] -= 1
        print(196471 - a[0] * 195 - a[0] / 3 * 5 - a[1] * 20 + (a[1] / 2 if a[0] % 3 != 2 else 0) - a[2])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
