Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of days from a birthdate to the millennium day according to the king's calendar. Specifically, the program uses a formula that does not accurately account for the different lengths of months and the special rules for years divisible by three.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
344 3 1
```

Expected output:
```
128976
```

However, using the provided formula in the program:
```python
a[0] -= 1
a[1] -= 1
print(196471 - a[0] * 195 - a[0] / 3 * 5 - a[1] * 20 + (a[1] / 2 if a[0] % 3 != 2 else 0) - a[2])
```

This formula does not correctly handle the different month lengths and the special rule for years divisible by three. For example, the year 344 has 10 big months and no small months, but the program does not account for this correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
