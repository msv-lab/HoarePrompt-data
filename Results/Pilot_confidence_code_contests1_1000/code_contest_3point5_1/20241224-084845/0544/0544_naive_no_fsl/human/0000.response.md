Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `sum` is greater than the sum of all possible lowbit values from 1 to `limit`. Specifically, for the input `(5, 1)`, the program should output `-1` because there is no set of distinct integers from 1 to 1 that can satisfy the condition. However, the program incorrectly tries to generate such a set and fails without printing `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the sum of all possible lowbit values from 1 to `limit` is less than `sum` before attempting to generate the set. If it is, the program should print `-1` immediately.
