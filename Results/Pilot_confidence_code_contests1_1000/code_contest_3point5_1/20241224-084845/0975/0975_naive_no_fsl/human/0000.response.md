Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of edges, which is not a sufficient condition to verify the transitive closure of friendships as described in the problem.

Consider the following input:
```
4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4
```

This input should result in "YES" because the friendships form a complete subgraph (clique) among members 1, 3, and 4. However, the program does not check if all members are transitively connected in the manner described.

In the provided solution, the program only checks the degree of neighbors, which is not a valid approach for verifying the transitive property of friendships. The program fails to ensure that if \(X\) is friends with \(Y\) and \(Y\) is friends with \(Z\), then \(X\) must also be friends with \(Z\).

A correct solution would involve checking all possible triplets of members to ensure the transitive property holds.
