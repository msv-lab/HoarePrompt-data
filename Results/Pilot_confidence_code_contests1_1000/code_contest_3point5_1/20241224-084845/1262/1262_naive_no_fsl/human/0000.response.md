Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the sums of the two groups. It incorrectly treats the entire list `V` as a sequence of weights without properly dividing them into two groups based on the index `T`. Specifically, the program only considers the prefix sum up to index `i-1` and the suffix sum starting from index `i`, but it does not explore all possible partitions by varying `T` from 1 to `N-1`.

To illustrate, let's consider the second example:
```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The correct partitions and their sums are:
- T = 1: S1 = 1, S2 = 4 (difference = 3)
- T = 2: S1 = 1 + 3 = 4, S2 = 1 (difference = 3)
- T = 3: S1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, S2 = 1 (difference = 4)

The minimum difference is 2, which can be achieved by partitioning at T = 2 (S1 = 4, S2 = 1).

However, the current implementation only checks the partition at T = 2 and misses other valid partitions, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of `T` from 1 to `N-1` and calculate the sums for each partition, updating the minimum difference accordingly.
