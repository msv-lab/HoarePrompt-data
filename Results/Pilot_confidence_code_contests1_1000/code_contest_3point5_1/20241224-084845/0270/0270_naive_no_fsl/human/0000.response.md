Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description accurately. According to the problem description, the ingredients required to make the cake are:

- 2 carrots
- 0 calories
- 100 g chocolate spread
- 1 pack of flour
- 1 egg

However, the program reads a sequence of integers from the input and calculates a sum based on these integers. This does not align with the ingredients specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check or use the values corresponding to the required ingredients (2 carrots, 0 calories, 100 g chocolate spread, 1 pack of flour, 1 egg). Instead, it uses a formula that multiplies each input value by its index and sums them up, which is unrelated to the described recipe.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the given problem description and is thus incorrect.
