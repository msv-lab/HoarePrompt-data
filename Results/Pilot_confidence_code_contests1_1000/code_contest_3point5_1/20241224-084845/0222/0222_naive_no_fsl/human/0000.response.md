Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates `n * (n ** 2 - 1) / 3` for each test case, which does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to gather all figures into one cell.

For a board of size \( n \times n \), where \( n \) is odd, the correct solution involves understanding that the figures need to be moved in such a way that they eventually converge to a single cell. The correct minimum number of moves required is actually \( \frac{n^2(n^2 - 1)}{4} \).

To verify this, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For \( n = 1 \):
   - The board is a single cell, so no moves are needed.
   - Expected output: 0
   - Program output: \( 1 \times (1^2 - 1) / 3 = 0 \)
   - This works correctly.

2. For \( n = 3 \):
   - The board is a 3x3 grid, and the minimum number of moves required is \( \frac{3^2(3^2 - 1)}{4} = \frac{9 \times 8}{4} = 18 \).
   - Program output: \( 3 \times (3^2 - 1) / 3 = 24 \)
   - This does not match the expected output.

Since the program gives incorrect results for \( n = 3 \) and likely other values of \( n \), the program is incorrect.
