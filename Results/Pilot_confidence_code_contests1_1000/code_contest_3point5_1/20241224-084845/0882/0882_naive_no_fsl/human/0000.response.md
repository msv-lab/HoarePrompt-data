Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and the sequence `a`.

2. **Handling k = 0 Case**: When `k = 0`, the program correctly counts the number of pairs of identical elements using combinations, which is calculated as `sum([i * (i - 1) // 2 for i in mem])`.

3. **Generating Masks**: For non-zero `k`, the program generates all possible bit masks with exactly `k` ones. These masks represent the differing bits between pairs.

4. **Counting Pairs**: The program iterates over each possible value in the sequence and checks how many times the bitwise XOR of the current value and each mask results in another value present in the sequence. This count is added to `ans`.

5. **Avoiding Double Counting**: The final result is divided by 2 (`ans >> 1`) to avoid counting each pair twice.

Given these steps, the program should handle all cases as described. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned that could fail and the logic seems sound, the program is correct.
