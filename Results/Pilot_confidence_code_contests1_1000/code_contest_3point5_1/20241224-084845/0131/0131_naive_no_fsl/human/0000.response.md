Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the condition that the total number of medalists \( g + s + b \) should not exceed half of the number of participants \( n \).

Consider the following test case:
```
20
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

- According to the problem description, the maximum number of medalists \( g + s + b \) should not exceed \( \frac{n}{2} \). For \( n = 20 \), the maximum number of medalists is 10.
- The program awards 2 gold, 5 silver, and 3 bronze medals, which totals to 10 medalists. However, it does not check if this exceeds \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the total number of medalists does not exceed \( \frac{n}{2} \). Here is a modified version of the `func_1` function that includes this check:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (g, s, b) = (0, 0, 0)
        l = 0
        p = -1
        for (i, j) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):
            if i > n // 2:
                break
            if p != j:
                if g == 0:
                    g = l
                elif s <= g:
                    s += l
                else:
                    b += l
                l = 0
            l += 1
            p = j
        if g == 0 or s == 0 or b == 0 or (g >= s) or (g >= b) or (g + s + b > n // 2):
            func_2(0, 0, 0)
        else:
            func_2(g, s, b)
```

This modification ensures that the total number of medalists does not exceed half of the number of participants, thus satisfying all the requirements.
