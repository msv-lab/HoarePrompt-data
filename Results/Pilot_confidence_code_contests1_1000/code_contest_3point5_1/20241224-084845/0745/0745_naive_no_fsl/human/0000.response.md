Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, for each input `x`, the program should first reverse the sequence of inputs and then perform the following operations:

1. Reverse the sequence of inputs into `varo`.
2. Perform the computation `abs(varo) - 5 * varo^3` and store the result in `aresulto`.
3. Compute `3^varo * 5` and store the result in `bresulto`.
4. Add `aresulto` and `bresulto` to get `resulto`.
5. Check if `CD - resulto` is less than 400.
   - If true, print `f(x) = resulto`.
   - If false, print `f(x) = MAGNA NIMIS!`.

However, the provided program does not reverse the sequence before performing the operations. Instead, it directly computes the result using the current value of `x` without considering the reversed sequence. This means the program will not work correctly for any input other than the last one in the sequence, as it fails to account for the reversed sequence requirement.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will compute the result using `3` instead of reversing the sequence to `[1, 2, 3]`. This discrepancy with the problem description makes the program incorrect.
