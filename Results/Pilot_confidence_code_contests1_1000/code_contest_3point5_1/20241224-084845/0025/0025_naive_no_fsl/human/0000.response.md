Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility that the rebus might not have a valid solution, which would result in the `x` variable being greater than 0 after attempting to adjust the values in the `plus` and `minus` lists. This can happen if the sum of the maximum possible values in the `plus` list is less than the required adjustment to balance the equation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
? - ? - ? = 1
```

In this case, the program will attempt to adjust the values but may fail to find a valid combination because the difference between the sums of the `plus` and `minus` lists cannot be exactly balanced to equal 1 with the given constraints. The current implementation does not properly check if a valid solution exists before attempting to construct one, leading to incorrect behavior.
