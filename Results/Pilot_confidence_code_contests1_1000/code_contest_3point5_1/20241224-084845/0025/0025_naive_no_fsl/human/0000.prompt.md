You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rebus of form ? + ? - ? + ? = n, consisting of only question marks, separated by arithmetic operation '+' and '-', equality and positive integer n. The goal is to replace each question mark with some positive integer from 1 to n, such that equality holds.

Input

The only line of the input contains a rebus. It's guaranteed that it contains no more than 100 question marks, integer n is positive and doesn't exceed 1 000 000, all letters and integers are separated by spaces, arithmetic operations are located only between question marks.

Output

The first line of the output should contain "Possible" (without quotes) if rebus has a solution and "Impossible" (without quotes) otherwise.

If the answer exists, the second line should contain any valid rebus with question marks replaced by integers from 1 to n. Follow the format given in the samples.

Examples

Input

? + ? - ? + ? + ? = 42


Output

Possible
9 + 13 - 39 + 28 + 31 = 42


Input

? - ? = 1


Output

Impossible


Input

? = 1000000


Output

Possible
1000000 = 1000000
Program:
```
import sys

line = raw_input().strip()
parts = line.split()
n = int(parts[-1])
plus = (line.count('+') + 1) * [n]
minus = line.count('-') * [1]
x = sum(plus) - sum(minus) - n
if x < 0:
    func_1()
for (i, value) in enumerate(plus):
    if x == 0:
        break
    delta = min(n - 1, x)
    plus[i] -= delta
    x -= delta
for (i, value) in enumerate(minus):
    if x == 0:
        break
    delta = min(n - 1, x)
    minus[i] += delta
    x -= delta
if x > 0:
    func_1()
if False:
    print(n)
    print(plus)
    print(minus)
    print(x)
parts[0] = str(plus[0])
plus_pos = 1
minus_pos = 0
for i in range(1, len(parts) - 2, 2):
    if parts[i] == '-':
        parts[i + 1] = str(minus[minus_pos])
        minus_pos += 1
    else:
        parts[i + 1] = str(plus[plus_pos])
        plus_pos += 1
print(' '.join(parts))

def func_1():
    print('Impossible')
    sys.exit()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
