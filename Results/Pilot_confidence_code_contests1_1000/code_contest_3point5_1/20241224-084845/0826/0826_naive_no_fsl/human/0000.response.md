Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a potential issue with the stopping condition in the loop where the Fibonacci sequence is generated. Specifically, the loop continues until `fib[-1]` reaches or exceeds \(10^{13}\), but it should stop when the `goal` is found to avoid unnecessary computations and potential infinite loops.

Consider the following input:
```
987
```

In this case, `987` is a Fibonacci number and appears in the sequence, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly because the loop might continue beyond finding `987`. Here's why:

1. The program checks if `goal` is already in `fib` before appending new elements.
2. Once `987` is found, it returns the index, which is correct.
3. However, the loop continues to generate more Fibonacci numbers after finding `987`, which is unnecessary and could potentially lead to performance issues or infinite loops if the stopping condition is not properly managed.

To fix this, the loop should break immediately once the `goal` is found. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(goal):
    fib = [0, 1]
    if goal == 0:
        return 0
    if goal == 1:
        return 1
    while True:
        next_fib = (fib[-2] + fib[-1]) % 1013
        fib.append(next_fib)
        if next_fib == goal:
            return len(fib) - 1
        if next_fib == 0:
            # Handle the case where the sequence repeats
            return -1
```

This ensures that the loop stops as soon as the `goal` is found, making the program correct according to the problem description.
