You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: John Doe has a list of all Fibonacci numbers modulo 1013. This list is infinite, it starts with numbers 0 and 1. Each number in the list, apart from the first two, is a sum of previous two modulo 1013. That is, John's list is made from the Fibonacci numbers' list by replacing each number there by the remainder when divided by 1013. 

John got interested in number f (0 ≤ f < 1013) and now wants to find its first occurrence in the list given above. Help John and find the number of the first occurence of number f in the list or otherwise state that number f does not occur in the list. 

The numeration in John's list starts from zero. There, the 0-th position is the number 0, the 1-st position is the number 1, the 2-nd position is the number 1, the 3-rd position is the number 2, the 4-th position is the number 3 and so on. Thus, the beginning of the list looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Input

The first line contains the single integer f (0 ≤ f < 1013) — the number, which position in the list we should find.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. 

Output

Print a single number — the number of the first occurrence of the given number in John's list. If this number doesn't occur in John's list, print -1.

Program:
```
print(func_1(int(input())))

def func_1(goal):
    fib = [0, 1]
    if goal == 0:
        return 0
    if goal == 1:
        return 1
    while goal not in fib and fib[-1] < 10 ** 13:
        fib.append(fib[-2] + fib[-1])
    if fib[-1] >= 10 ** 13:
        return -1
    return fib.index(goal)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
