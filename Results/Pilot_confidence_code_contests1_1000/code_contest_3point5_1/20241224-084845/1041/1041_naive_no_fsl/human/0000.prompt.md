You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters "a", "b" and "c" and question marks "?".

Let the number of question marks in the string s be k. Let's replace each question mark with one of the letters "a", "b" and "c". Here we can obtain all 3^{k} possible strings consisting only of letters "a", "b" and "c". For example, if s = "ac?b?c" then we can obtain the following strings: ["acabac", "acabbc", "acabcc", "acbbac", "acbbbc", "acbbcc", "accbac", "accbbc", "accbcc"].

Your task is to count the total number of subsequences "abc" in all resulting strings. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^{9} + 7.

A subsequence of the string t is such a sequence that can be derived from the string t after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. For example, the string "baacbc" contains two subsequences "abc" — a subsequence consisting of letters at positions (2, 5, 6) and a subsequence consisting of letters at positions (3, 5, 6).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the length of s.

The second line of the input contains the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters "a", "b" and "c" and question marks"?".

Output

Print the total number of subsequences "abc" in all strings you can obtain if you replace all question marks with letters "a", "b" and "c", modulo 10^{9} + 7.

Note

In the first example, we can obtain 9 strings:

  * "acabac" — there are 2 subsequences "abc", 
  * "acabbc" — there are 4 subsequences "abc", 
  * "acabcc" — there are 4 subsequences "abc", 
  * "acbbac" — there are 2 subsequences "abc", 
  * "acbbbc" — there are 3 subsequences "abc", 
  * "acbbcc" — there are 4 subsequences "abc", 
  * "accbac" — there is 1 subsequence "abc", 
  * "accbbc" — there are 2 subsequences "abc", 
  * "accbcc" — there are 2 subsequences "abc". 



So, there are 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 24 subsequences "abc" in total.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
tmp = raw_input()
print(func_1(tmp))

def func_1(string):
    a = 0
    b = 0
    c = 0
    v = 1
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in string:
        if i == 'a':
            a += v
        elif i == 'b':
            b += a
        elif i == 'c':
            c += b
        else:
            (a, b, c, v) = ((3 * a + v) % MOD, (3 * b + a) % MOD, (3 * c + b) % MOD, 3 * v % MOD)
    return c % MOD


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
