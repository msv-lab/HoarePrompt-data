You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova plans to go to the conference by train. Initially, the train is at the point 1 and the destination point of the path is the point L. The speed of the train is 1 length unit per minute (i.e. at the first minute the train is at the point 1, at the second minute — at the point 2 and so on).

There are lanterns on the path. They are placed at the points with coordinates divisible by v (i.e. the first lantern is at the point v, the second is at the point 2v and so on).

There is also exactly one standing train which occupies all the points from l to r inclusive.

Vova can see the lantern at the point p if p is divisible by v and there is no standing train at this position (p not∈ [l; r]). Thus, if the point with the lantern is one of the points covered by the standing train, Vova can't see this lantern.

Your problem is to say the number of lanterns Vova will see during the path. Vova plans to go to t different conferences, so you should answer t independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of queries.

Then t lines follow. The i-th line contains four integers L_i, v_i, l_i, r_i (1 ≤ L, v ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ L) — destination point of the i-th path, the period of the lantern appearance and the segment occupied by the standing train.

Output

Print t lines. The i-th line should contain one integer — the answer for the i-th query.

Example

Input

4
10 2 3 7
100 51 51 51
1234 1 100 199
1000000000 1 1 1000000000


Output

3
0
1134
0

Note

For the first example query, the answer is 3. There are lanterns at positions 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, but Vova didn't see the lanterns at positions 4 and 6 because of the standing train.

For the second example query, the answer is 0 because the only lantern is at the point 51 and there is also a standing train at this point.

For the third example query, the answer is 1134 because there are 1234 lanterns, but Vova didn't see the lanterns from the position 100 to the position 199 inclusive.

For the fourth example query, the answer is 0 because the standing train covers the whole path.
Program:
```
def func():
    t = input()
    list = []
    for arr in range(0, t):
        list.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for data in list:
        L = data[0]
        v = data[1]
        head = data[2]
        tale = data[3]
        lampsTotal = int(L / v)
        if tale == head:
            lampsMissed = int(head / v)
        else:
            lampsMissed = int((tale - head + 1) / v)
        print(lampsTotal - lampsMissed)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
