Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the total number of pebbles of a type is less than `2 * pocket_limit`. Specifically, the program subtracts `pocket_limit` from the first two pebbles in the sorted list during each iteration, which may result in an incorrect number of days required. This approach fails when the sum of the two largest pebbles is less than `2 * pocket_limit`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 1 3
```

According to the problem description, Anastasia needs 3 days to collect all pebbles:
- Day 1: Collect 2 pebbles of the third type (1 + 1).
- Day 2: Collect 1 pebble of the first type.
- Day 3: Collect 1 pebble of the second type.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of days as follows:
- Day 1: Subtract 2 from the third type (3 - 2 = 1), remaining pebbles = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
- Day 2: Subtract 2 from the third type again (1 - 2 = -1, but only 1 is left), remaining pebbles = 1 + 1 = 2.
- Day 3: Subtract 2 from the first and second types (1 - 2 = -1, 1 - 2 = -1, but only 1 is left), remaining pebbles = 0.

Thus, the program outputs 3 days, which is correct in this specific case, but it fails to generalize correctly for all cases. For instance, with the input `3 2` and pebbles `[1, 1, 2]`, the program would incorrectly output 2 days instead of 3.
