You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anastasia loves going for a walk in Central Uzhlyandian Park. But she became uninterested in simple walking, so she began to collect Uzhlyandian pebbles. At first, she decided to collect all the pebbles she could find in the park.

She has only two pockets. She can put at most k pebbles in each pocket at the same time. There are n different pebble types in the park, and there are wi pebbles of the i-th type. Anastasia is very responsible, so she never mixes pebbles of different types in same pocket. However, she can put different kinds of pebbles in different pockets at the same time. Unfortunately, she can't spend all her time collecting pebbles, so she can collect pebbles from the park only once a day.

Help her to find the minimum number of days needed to collect all the pebbles of Uzhlyandian Central Park, taking into consideration that Anastasia can't place pebbles of different types in same pocket.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109) — the number of different pebble types and number of pebbles Anastasia can place in one pocket.

The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (1 ≤ wi ≤ 104) — number of pebbles of each type. 

Output

The only line of output contains one integer — the minimum number of days Anastasia needs to collect all the pebbles.

Examples

Input

3 2
2 3 4


Output

3


Input

5 4
3 1 8 9 7


Output

5

Note

In the first sample case, Anastasia can collect all pebbles of the first type on the first day, of second type — on the second day, and of third type — on the third day.

Optimal sequence of actions in the second sample case: 

  * In the first day Anastasia collects 8 pebbles of the third type. 
  * In the second day she collects 8 pebbles of the fourth type. 
  * In the third day she collects 3 pebbles of the first type and 1 pebble of the fourth type. 
  * In the fourth day she collects 7 pebbles of the fifth type. 
  * In the fifth day she collects 1 pebble of the second type. 
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    line_one = sys.stdin.readline().split()
    line_two = sys.stdin.readline().split()
    types = int(line_one[0])
    pocket_limit = int(line_one[1])
    pebbles = map(int, line_two)
    days = 0
    remaining_pebbles = sum(pebbles)
    while remaining_pebbles > 0:
        days += 1
        pebbles = [pebble for pebble in pebbles if pebble > 0]
        pebbles.sort()
        if len(pebbles) > 1:
            pebbles[0] -= pocket_limit
            pebbles[1] -= pocket_limit
        elif len(pebbles) > 0:
            pebbles[0] -= 2 * pocket_limit
        remaining_pebbles = sum(pebbles)
    print(days)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
