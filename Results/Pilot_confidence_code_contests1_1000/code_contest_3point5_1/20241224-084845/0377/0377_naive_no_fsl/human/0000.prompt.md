You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.

When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient. The value of the new ingredient will be (x + y) / 2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.

After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 1000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
v_1 v_2 \ldots v_N


Output

Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.

Your output will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-5}.

Examples

Input

2
3 4


Output

3.5


Input

3
500 300 200


Output

375


Input

5
138 138 138 138 138


Output

138
Program:
```
n = int(input())
v = [float(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
v.sort()
result = v[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    result = func_1(result, v[i])
print(result)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
