Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to calculate the number of right triangles by counting the number of '*' cells in both rows and columns and then using these counts to determine the number of possible right triangles. However, the logic for calculating `row_dirs` and `col_dirs` is flawed. Specifically, the program sums the counts of '*' cells from both directions without properly resetting the counters, leading to incorrect values in `row_dirs` and `col_dirs`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4
*.*.
.*.*
*.*.
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the number of right triangles because it does not reset the counters for each column and row separately. This results in overcounting or undercounting the number of valid right triangles.

To fix this, the program needs to properly reset the counters for each column and row separately before calculating the number of '*' cells. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    col_dirs = [[0 for c in range(m)] for r in range(n)]
    row_dirs = [[0 for c in range(m)] for r in range(n)]
    
    # Calculate col_dirs
    for c in range(m):
        count = 0
        for r in range(n):
            if grid[r][c] == '*':
                count += 1
            col_dirs[r][c] = count
    
    # Calculate row_dirs
    for r in range(n):
        count = 0
        for c in range(m):
            if grid[r][c] == '*':
                count += 1
            row_dirs[r][c] = count
    
    total = 0
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if grid[r][c] == '*':
                total += row_dirs[r][c] * col_dirs[r][c]
    
    print(total)
```

This corrected version ensures that the counters are reset for each column and row separately, providing accurate counts of '*' cells and thus the correct number of right triangles.
