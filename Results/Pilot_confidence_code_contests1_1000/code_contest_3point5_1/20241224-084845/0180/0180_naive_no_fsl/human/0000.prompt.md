You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob came to a cash & carry store, put n items into his trolley, and went to the checkout counter to pay. Each item is described by its price ci and time ti in seconds that a checkout assistant spends on this item. While the checkout assistant is occupied with some item, Bob can steal some other items from his trolley. To steal one item Bob needs exactly 1 second. What is the minimum amount of money that Bob will have to pay to the checkout assistant? Remember, please, that it is Bob, who determines the order of items for the checkout assistant.

Input

The first input line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). In each of the following n lines each item is described by a pair of numbers ti, ci (0 ≤ ti ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109). If ti is 0, Bob won't be able to steal anything, while the checkout assistant is occupied with item i.

Output

Output one number — answer to the problem: what is the minimum amount of money that Bob will have to pay.

Program:

v = []
t = []
p = 0
z = 0
for j in range(0, n):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    t.append(a)
    p = p + b
    v.append(b)
    z = z + a
print(func_1(0, 0, n - 1))

def func_1(p, z, i):
    if i < 0:
        return p
    elif z >= 1:
        return min(func_1(p + v[i], z + t[i], i - 1), func_1(p, z - 1, i - 1))
    else:
        return func_1(p + v[i], z + t[i], i - 1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
