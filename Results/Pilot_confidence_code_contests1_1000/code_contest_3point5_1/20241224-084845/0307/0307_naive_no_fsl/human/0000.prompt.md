You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel universes is "like travelling sideways". However, he incorrectly thought that there were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know, there will never be more than 250.

Heidi recently got her hands on a multiverse observation tool. She was able to see all n universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k-th universe.

The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m.

Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken.

More specifically, 

  * When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. 
  * When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. 



Heidi wants to perform a simulation of t decisions. Each time a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse (i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, m and t (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each of the following t lines is in one of the following formats: 

  * "1 i" — meaning that a universe is inserted at the position i (1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 
  * "0 i" — meaning that the i-th link is broken (1 ≤ i ≤ l - 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 

Output

Output t lines. Each line should contain l, the current length of the multiverse and k, the current position of the Doctor.

It is guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the multiverse will have length at most m and when the link breaking is performed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse.

Example

Input


5 2 10 4
0 1
1 1
0 4
1 2


Output


4 1
5 2
4 2
5 3

Note

The multiverse initially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second.

First, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the Doctor in the first.

Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the multiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in the second universe.

Then, the rightmost link was broken.

Finally, a universe was added between the first and the second universe.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
