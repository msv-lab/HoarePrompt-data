Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem for all given constraints and examples. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of events `n` and the segments `[li, ri]` for each event.
2. **Sorting and Selection**: The events are sorted based on their end dates (`r`). This ensures that we always consider the earliest possible date within the valid range for each event.
3. **Date Assignment**: The program iteratively selects the earliest possible date within the valid range for each event, ensuring no two events are scheduled on the same day. Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, the program will always find a valid set of dates.

Given the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the given logic.
