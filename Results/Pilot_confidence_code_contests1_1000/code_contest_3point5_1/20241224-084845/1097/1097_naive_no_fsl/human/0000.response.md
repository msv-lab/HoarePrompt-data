Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to construct a polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree at most \( p-1 \) such that \( f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod{p} \) for each \( i \) in the range \( 0 \leq i \leq p-1 \).

However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix \( A \) is constructed in a way that does not align with the required conditions. The matrix should be designed to solve the system of linear equations derived from the conditions \( f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod{p} \). The current construction of \( A \) is not correct and does not reflect the necessary relationships between the coefficients \( b_i \) and the values \( a_i \).

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to solve the linear system \( Ax = b \) modulo \( p \). However, the implementation of this function seems to be incorrect. It uses a method that does not guarantee finding the correct solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function does not properly handle the modular arithmetic and the constraints of the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is used to output the result, but it is called with parameters that do not seem to match the expected output format. The function `func_3` takes arguments and writes them to the standard output, but the arguments passed to it do not seem to correspond to the correct coefficients of the polynomial.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
