Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the missing elements are at both ends of the array. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the value of `k` when the missing elements are at positions 0 and n-1. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
3
-1 10 -1
3
10 -1 -1
```

- For the first test case, the input is `-1 10 -1`. The program will set `mini` and `maxi` to 10, and `k` will be 10. However, the correct value of `k` should be 5 to minimize the maximum absolute difference.
- For the second test case, the input is `10 -1 -1`. The program will set `mini` and `maxi` to 10, and `k` will be 10. However, the correct value of `k` should be 10 to minimize the maximum absolute difference.

The program fails to handle these boundary conditions correctly, leading to potentially incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
