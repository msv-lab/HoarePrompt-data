Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided Python program, I can confirm that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program simulates the process of throwing boulders onto the mountains and determining the position of the k-th boulder or identifying if it falls into the waste collection system.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of mountains (`n`) and the number of boulders (`k`).
3. It reads the heights of the mountains.
4. It handles the special case where there is only one mountain.
5. It simulates the process of throwing boulders:
   - Starting from the first mountain, it checks if the current mountain is higher than the next one.
   - If it is, the boulder rolls to the next mountain.
   - If not, the boulder stops and the height of the current mountain increases by 1.
   - The boulder count is decremented.
   - If a boulder reaches the last mountain, it falls into the waste collection system.
6. It prints the position of the k-th boulder or -1 if it falls into the system.

Given the detailed simulation and the handling of edge cases (such as a single mountain), the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements. There are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints.
