Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle strings that contain an unequal number of 'T's and 'M's in a way that prevents valid partitions into "TMT" subsequences. 

Consider the following test case:
```
6
TMTTTT
```

In this case, the string "TMTTTT" cannot be partitioned into valid "TMT" subsequences because there are more 'T's than necessary to form complete "TMT" sequences. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for this input, when it should print "NO".

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of 'T's is exactly twice the number of 'M's before attempting to partition the string. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if s.count('T') != 2 * s.count('M'):
            print("NO")
            continue
        t_indices = sorted([i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == 'T'])
        m_indices = sorted([i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == 'M'])
        
        poss = True
        for i in range(len(m_indices)):
            if t_indices[i*2] > m_indices[i]:
                poss = False
                break
            if t_indices[i*2+1] > m_indices[i]:
                poss = False
                break
        
        print("YES" if poss else "NO")
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of 'T's is exactly twice the number of 'M's and then attempts to partition the string into valid "TMT" subsequences.
