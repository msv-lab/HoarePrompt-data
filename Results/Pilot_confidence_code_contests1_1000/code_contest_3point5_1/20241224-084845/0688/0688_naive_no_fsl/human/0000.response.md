Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program uses Python 2 syntax (`raw_input` and `has_key`), which may not work in Python 3 without modifications. However, more importantly, the program logic itself has an issue. It checks if the digits provided can match the sequence "1974" but does not ensure that each digit appears only once and in the correct order. For instance, consider the input `1 1 9 4`. The program will still output `YES`, which is incorrect because the digits cannot form the exact sequence "1974" (since '1' appears twice).

To fix this, the program needs to check if the digits can be rearranged exactly to form "1974". Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    num_string = input()  # Use input() for Python 3
    num_list = sorted(num_string)
    target_list = ['1', '9', '7', '4']
    
    if num_list == target_list:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


# Example usage
func()
```

This version sorts the input digits and compares them to the sorted target list "1974". If they match, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`. This ensures that the digits are exactly in the required sequence.
