Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly and will not run as intended. The main issue is that the program expects multiple inputs in a loop format, but the problem description specifies that the input should be read in a batch (i.e., `t` test cases followed by `t` integers). The current implementation reads inputs in a way that is not aligned with the problem's input format.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then read `t` integers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
data = []
for _ in range(t):
    data.append(int(input()))

for i in data:
    j = i
    while not func_2(j)[0]:
        j += 1
    print(j)

def func_1(a, b):
    if a < b:
        (a, b) = (b, a)
    while b != 0:
        temp = a % b
        a = b
        b = temp
    return a

def func_2(a):
    temp = a
    t = 0
    while temp:
        t += temp % 10
        temp //= 10  # Use integer division to avoid floating point issues
    if func_1(a, t) > 1:
        return (True, func_1(a, t))
    else:
        return (False, 0)
```

With this correction, the program should now correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description and find the smallest integer \( x \geq n \) such that \(\text{gcdSum}(x) > 1\).
