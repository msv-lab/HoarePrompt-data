Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate all possible combinations of the digits '3', '5', and '7' up to a certain length and counts those that are less than or equal to N. However, this approach has a critical flaw. It only considers combinations of '3', '5', and '7' without any specific order, which means it might miss permutations that start with a digit other than '3', '5', or '7'.

For example, consider N = 753. According to the problem description, 753 should be counted as a Shichi-Go-San number because it contains all three digits 7, 5, and 3 exactly once. However, the current implementation will not count 753 because it generates combinations starting from the shortest length (3) and does not ensure that the first digit is always 3, 5, or 7.

To fix this, the program needs to generate permutations of the digits '3', '5', and '7' and check if they are less than or equal to N. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import itertools

def func():
    n = int(input())
    chars = ['3', '5', '7']
    count = 0
    for r in range(3, int(math.log10(n)) + 2):
        for perm in itertools.permutations(chars * r, r):
            num = int(''.join(perm))
            if num <= n:
                count += 1
    print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all permutations of the digits '3', '5', and '7' are checked, including those that do not start with '3', '5', or '7', but still contain all three digits.
