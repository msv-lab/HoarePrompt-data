Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a hashing approach, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine string equivalence as per the given problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the recursive splitting and comparing of string halves correctly according to the problem statement.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
aaba
abaa
```

The correct output should be "YES" because the string "aaba" can be split into "aa" and "ba", and "abaa" can be split into "ab" and "aa", satisfying the equivalence conditions.

However, the provided program incorrectly determines that these strings are not equivalent. This is because the recursive function `func_1` does not properly handle the cases where the string lengths do not perfectly divide into halves or when the splits do not match the equivalence conditions specified.

For instance, the function `func_1` checks for equality of substrings but does not recursively check all possible valid splits and combinations as described in the problem statement. It only considers direct splits and comparisons without ensuring all conditions for equivalence are met.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly determine string equivalence for some cases, making it incorrect.
