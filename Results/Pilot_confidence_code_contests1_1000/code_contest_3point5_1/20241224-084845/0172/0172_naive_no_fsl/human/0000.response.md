Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The function `func_11` is defined to handle the problem, but it does not accurately calculate the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn based on the given inputs of sticks (`a`) and diamonds (`b`). Instead, it appears to be implementing logic for a different problem.

Specifically, `func_11` is trying to solve a problem related to finding the minimum value among three variables: `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3`. This is not related to the original problem of crafting shovels and swords.

To solve the original problem, the logic should be as follows:
- Calculate how many shovels can be crafted: `min(a // 2, b)`
- Calculate how many swords can be crafted: `min(b // 2, a)`
- The total number of emeralds earned will be the sum of the shovels and swords crafted.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_11` function:

```python
def func_11():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        shovels = min(a // 2, b)
        swords = min(b // 2, a)
        emeralds = shovels + swords
        print(emeralds)
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn based on the given inputs.
