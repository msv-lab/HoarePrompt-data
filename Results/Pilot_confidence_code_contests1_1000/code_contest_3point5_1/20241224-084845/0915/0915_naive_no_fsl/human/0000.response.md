Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. It reads the calorie values for each strip and the sequence of appearances of the black square. It then iterates through the sequence, summing up the calories wasted for each strip touched according to the sequence. The program handles all described inputs and outputs as specified. There are no obvious edge cases or potential misinterpretations in the given code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the constraints provided.
