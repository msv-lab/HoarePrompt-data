Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all souvenirs have a weight of 3 and the maximum weight capacity `m` is less than 3. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum cost because it does not properly consider the constraints of the weight limit.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
3 10
3 10
3 10
```

The expected output is `20` since Petya can only take two souvenirs with a total weight not exceeding 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs `10` because it does not correctly handle the weight constraint for souvenirs with weight 3. This indicates that the program does not work as expected for this specific case.
