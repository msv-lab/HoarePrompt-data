Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that both the red and blue cells must be 4-connected. Specifically, the program alternates between placing red and blue cells in such a way that the blue cells are not necessarily 4-connected.

Consider the following input:
```
5 5
.....
.#.#.
.....
.#.#.
.....
```

The expected output should maintain 4-connectedness for both red and blue cells. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For example, the generated output might look like this:
```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....

.###.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.....
```

In the above output, the blue cells do not form a 4-connected component, as the cells are split into separate groups without proper connectivity. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
