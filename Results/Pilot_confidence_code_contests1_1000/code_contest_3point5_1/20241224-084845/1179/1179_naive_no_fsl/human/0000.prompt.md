You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alyona's mother wants to present an array of n non-negative integers to Alyona. The array should be special. 

Alyona is a capricious girl so after she gets the array, she inspects m of its subarrays. Subarray is a set of some subsequent elements of the array. The i-th subarray is described with two integers li and ri, and its elements are a[li], a[li + 1], ..., a[ri].

Alyona is going to find mex for each of the chosen subarrays. Among these m mexes the girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimum mex to be as large as possible. 

You are to find an array a of n elements so that the minimum mex among those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible.

The mex of a set S is a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not in S.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105).

The next m lines contain information about the subarrays chosen by Alyona. The i-th of these lines contains two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n), that describe the subarray a[li], a[li + 1], ..., a[ri].

Output

In the first line print single integer — the maximum possible minimum mex.

In the second line print n integers — the array a. All the elements in a should be between 0 and 109.

It is guaranteed that there is an optimal answer in which all the elements in a are between 0 and 109.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

5 3
1 3
2 5
4 5


Output

2
1 0 2 1 0


Input

4 2
1 4
2 4


Output

3
5 2 0 1

Note

The first example: the mex of the subarray (1, 3) is equal to 3, the mex of the subarray (2, 5) is equal to 3, the mex of the subarray (4, 5) is equal to 2 as well, thus the minumal mex among the subarrays chosen by Alyona is equal to 2.
Program:
```
def func():
    input = raw_input
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    r = []
    for _ in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        r.append(b - a + 1)
    r.sort()
    ans = r[0]
    print(ans)
    for i in range(n):
        (print(i) % ans,)
    print('')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
