Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that all points \((x', y')\) such that \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must be assigned a number not less than \(i\). Specifically, the program does not ensure that if a point \((x, y)\) is assigned a number \(i\), then all points \((x', y')\) with \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) are assigned numbers \(\geq i\).

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
4
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
-1 -2 -1 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```

However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it fails to maintain the aesthetic condition for the points \((1, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\):

1. Point \((0, 0)\) is assigned number 1.
2. Point \((1, 0)\) is assigned number 2, which violates the condition since \((1, 1)\) should be assigned a number \(\geq 2\) but it is assigned number 3 instead.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the aesthetic condition, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
