Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the function `g(i, j)` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function and the overall logic do not accurately compute `g(i, j)` according to the given pseudo-code. The `g(i, j)` function should sum the elements from `min(i, j) + 1` to `max(i, j)`, but the program attempts to find a `j` within a specific range based on a square root calculation, which does not match the intended logic.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 -1
```

According to the problem description, the correct value of `mini â‰  j f(i, j)` should be calculated based on the actual definition of `g(i, j)`. However, the program incorrectly handles the range for `j` and does not compute `g(i, j)` properly. This discrepancy means the program will not produce the correct output for all cases, hence it is incorrect.
