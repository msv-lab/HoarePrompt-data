You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iahub and Sorin are the best competitive programmers in their town. However, they can't both qualify to an important contest. The selection will be made with the help of a single problem. Blatnatalag, a friend of Iahub, managed to get hold of the problem before the contest. Because he wants to make sure Iahub will be the one qualified, he tells Iahub the following task.

You're given an (1-based) array a with n elements. Let's define function f(i, j) (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) as (i - j)2 + g(i, j)2. Function g is calculated by the following pseudo-code:
    
    
      
    int g(int i, int j) {  
        int sum = 0;  
        for (int k = min(i, j) + 1; k <= max(i, j); k = k + 1)  
            sum = sum + a[k];  
        return sum;  
    }  
    

Find a value mini ≠ j f(i, j).

Probably by now Iahub already figured out the solution to this problem. Can you?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Next line contains n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] ( - 104 ≤ a[i] ≤ 104). 

Output

Output a single integer — the value of mini ≠ j f(i, j).

Program:

range = xrange
cumsum = [int(x) for x in os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size).split()]
n = cumsum[0]
cumsum[0] = 0
for i in range(n):
    cumsum[i + 1] += cumsum[i]
besta = 10100 ** 2
for i in range(1, n):
    sqrtbesta = int(math.sqrt(besta))
    lowerbound = -sqrtbesta + cumsum[i]
    upperbound = sqrtbesta + cumsum[i]
    besta = func_1(besta, i, sqrtbesta, lowerbound, upperbound, cumsum[i])
print(besta)

def func_1(besta, i, sqrtbesta, lowerbound, upperbound, cumsumi):
    for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i - 1 + sqrtbesta) + 1):
        if lowerbound < cumsum[j] < upperbound and (j - i) ** 2 + (cumsum[j] - cumsumi) ** 2 < besta:
            besta = (j - i) ** 2 + (cumsum[j] - cumsumi) ** 2
    return besta


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
