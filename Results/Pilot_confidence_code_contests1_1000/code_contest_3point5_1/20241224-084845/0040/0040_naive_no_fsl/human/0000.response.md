Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the nearest checkpoint for each student based on the Manhattan distance. The program iterates through each student's coordinates and calculates the Manhattan distance to each checkpoint. It then selects the checkpoint with the smallest index among the closest ones. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly. There is no apparent flaw or edge case that the program does not handle properly within the provided constraints.
