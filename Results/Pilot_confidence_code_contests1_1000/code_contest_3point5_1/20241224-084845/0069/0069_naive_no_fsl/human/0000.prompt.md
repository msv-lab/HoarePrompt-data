You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is working on a new project called "Polychat". Following modern tendencies in IT, he decided, that this project should contain chat as well. To achieve this goal, Polycarp has spent several hours in front of his laptop and implemented a chat server that can process three types of commands:

  * Include a person to the chat ('Add' command). 
  * Remove a person from the chat ('Remove' command). 
  * Send a message from a person to all people, who are currently in the chat, including the one, who sends the message ('Send' command). 



Now Polycarp wants to find out the amount of outgoing traffic that the server will produce while processing a particular set of commands.

Polycarp knows that chat server sends no traffic for 'Add' and 'Remove' commands. When 'Send' command is processed, server sends l bytes to each participant of the chat, where l is the length of the message.

As Polycarp has no time, he is asking for your help in solving this problem.

Input

Input file will contain not more than 100 commands, each in its own line. No line will exceed 100 characters. Formats of the commands will be the following:

  * +<name> for 'Add' command. 
  * -<name> for 'Remove' command. 
  * <sender_name>:<message_text> for 'Send' command. 



<name> and <sender_name> is a non-empty sequence of Latin letters and digits. <message_text> can contain letters, digits and spaces, but can't start or end with a space. <message_text> can be an empty line.

It is guaranteed, that input data are correct, i.e. there will be no 'Add' command if person with such a name is already in the chat, there will be no 'Remove' command if there is no person with such a name in the chat etc.

All names are case-sensitive.

Output

Print a single number â€” answer to the problem.

Program:
```
def func():
    count = 0
    total = 0
    while 1:
        try:
            s = raw_input()
        except:
            break
        if len(s) == 0:
            break
        if s[0] == '+':
            count += 1
        elif s[0] == '-':
            count -= 1
        else:
            index = s.index(':')
            length = len(s) - index - 1
            total += length * count


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
