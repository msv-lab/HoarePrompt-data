Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all possible rotations of the dice correctly. Specifically, the `roll_dice` method only handles moves in the cardinal directions (North, South, West, East), but it does not cover all possible rotations that can be made with a die. 

For example, consider the following two dice configurations:
- Die 1: Top=1, Front=2, Right=3, Left=4, Back=5, Bottom=6
- Die 2: Top=1, Front=3, Right=4, Left=2, Back=5, Bottom=6

These two dice are not equivalent under the rules described in the problem statement (Dice III), but the current implementation might incorrectly identify them as the same because it does not cover all possible rotations.

To fix this, the `roll_dice` method should include additional rotation logic to cover all possible orientations of the dice. However, implementing this fully would require a more comprehensive approach to handling all possible rotations, which is beyond the scope of the current implementation. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
