Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `-1` Values**: The program attempts to handle `-1` values using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which are part of a Fenwick Tree (FWT) implementation. However, these functions are not properly defined or used to count inversions or handle the `-1` values as required.

2. **Misunderstanding of Inversions**: The program calculates inversions incorrectly. The function `func_3` seems to be intended to calculate prefix sums using FWT, but it is not clear how it relates to calculating inversions in the context of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The program attempts to calculate the expected number of inversions using a combination of prefix sums and factorials, but the logic for this calculation is flawed. The variables `cnt`, `cntNeg`, and `missingGreater`, `missingSmaller` are not correctly used to account for the inversions introduced by the `-1` values.

4. **Missing Logic for Random Permutation Generation**: The problem statement mentions that the sequence is turned into a valid permutation randomly with equal probability. There is no logic in the provided code to handle this random generation process or to ensure that all valid permutations are considered equally.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
