Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in its calculation of `roundwina` and `roundwinb`. Specifically, the way `roundwina` and `roundwinb` are updated does not correctly account for the total weight of mushrooms collected over time. The program assumes that the cells are visited in a specific order without properly considering the growth rates and the requirement to visit each cell exactly once.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3
6 5 4
```

The optimal route should collect mushrooms as follows:
- Start at (1,1): 0 * 1
- Move to (1,2): 1 * 2
- Move to (1,3): 2 * 3
- Move to (2,3): 3 * 4
- Move to (2,2): 4 * 5
- Move to (2,1): 5 * 6

This results in a total weight of 70, as shown in the example.

However, the provided program calculates the total weight incorrectly. It uses a dynamic programming approach that does not correctly reflect the total weight of mushrooms collected over time. The variable `t` is used to track the time but is not correctly integrated into the calculation of the total weight.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate the total weight of mushrooms collected over time, considering the growth rates and the requirement to visit each cell exactly once. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
