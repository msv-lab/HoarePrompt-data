You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We call a string good, if after merging all the consecutive equal characters, the resulting string is palindrome. For example, "aabba" is good, because after the merging step it will become "aba".

Given a string, you have to find two values:

  1. the number of good substrings of even length; 
  2. the number of good substrings of odd length. 

Input

The first line of the input contains a single string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). Each character of the string will be either 'a' or 'b'.

Output

Print two space-separated integers: the number of good substrings of even length and the number of good substrings of odd length.

Examples

Input

bb


Output

1 2


Input

baab


Output

2 4


Input

babb


Output

2 5


Input

babaa


Output

2 7

Note

In example 1, there are three good substrings ("b", "b", and "bb"). One of them has even length and two of them have odd length.

In example 2, there are six good substrings (i.e. "b", "a", "a", "b", "aa", "baab"). Two of them have even length and four of them have odd length.

In example 3, there are seven good substrings (i.e. "b", "a", "b", "b", "bb", "bab", "babb"). Two of them have even length and five of them have odd length.

Definitions

A substring s[l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) of string s = s1s2... sn is string slsl + 1... sr.

A string s = s1s2... sn is a palindrome if it is equal to string snsn - 1... s1.
Program:
```
import re
import sys

def func():
    ans = [0, 0]
    s = raw_input()
    n = len(s)
    for i in xrange(n):
        j = 0
        while j <= min(i, n - i - 1):
            t = ''
            t = re.sub('[^\\w\\s]|(.)(?=\\1)', '', s[i - j:i + j + 1])
            if t[::-1] != t:
                if not (i - j > 0 and i + j < n - 1 and (s[i - j - 1] == s[i + j + 1])):
                    break
            else:
                ans[1] += 1
            j += 1
    for i in xrange(n):
        j = 0
        while j <= min(i, n - i - 2):
            t = re.sub('[^\\w\\s]|(.)(?=\\1)', '', s[i - j:i + j + 2])
            if t[::-1] != t:
                if not (i - j > 0 and i + j < n - 2 and (s[i - j - 1] == s[i + j + 2])):
                    break
            else:
                ans[0] += 1
            j += 1
    "\n\nfor i in xrange(n):\n    j = 0\n    while i - j >= 0 and i + j < n:\n        t = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]|(.)(?=\x01)', '', s[i - j:i + j + 1])\n        if t[::-1] != t:\n            break\n        if i + j < n - 1:\n            t = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]|(.)(?=\x01)', '', s[i - j:i + j + 2])\n            if t[::-1] != t:\n                break\n        j += 1\n        ans[\n"
    sys.stdout.write('%s %s' % tuple(ans))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
