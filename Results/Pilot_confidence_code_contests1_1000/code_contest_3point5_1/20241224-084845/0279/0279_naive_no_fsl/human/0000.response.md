Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count good substrings of both even and odd lengths. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Merging Logic**: The program uses regular expressions to merge consecutive equal characters, which is unnecessary and complicates the logic. Instead, it should directly check if a substring is a palindrome without removing consecutive equal characters.

2. **Logic for Even Length Substrings**: The program attempts to find palindromic substrings of even length but the logic is flawed. Specifically, it checks if `t[::-1] != t` to break out of the loop, which does not correctly identify palindromic substrings. It should instead focus on checking the symmetry of the substring around the center.

3. **Logic for Odd Length Substrings**: Similarly, the logic for finding palindromic substrings of odd length is also incorrect. It attempts to merge consecutive characters before checking for palindromicity, which is not required.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    ans = [0, 0]

    # Function to check if a substring is a palindrome
    def is_palindrome(sub):
        return sub == sub[::-1]

    # Counting good substrings of even length
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, min(i + 1, n - i)):
            if is_palindrome(s[i - j:i + j + 1]):
                ans[0] += 1

    # Counting good substrings of odd length
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(min(i + 1, n - i - 1)):
            if is_palindrome(s[i - j:i + j + 2]):
                ans[1] += 1

    print(ans[0], ans[1])

func()
```

This corrected version directly checks for palindromic substrings without unnecessary operations and ensures that both even and odd length substrings are correctly counted.
