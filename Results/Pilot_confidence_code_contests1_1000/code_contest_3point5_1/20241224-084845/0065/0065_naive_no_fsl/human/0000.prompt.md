You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: New Year is coming, and Jaehyun decided to read many books during 2015, unlike this year. He has n books numbered by integers from 1 to n. The weight of the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) book is wi.

As Jaehyun's house is not large enough to have a bookshelf, he keeps the n books by stacking them vertically. When he wants to read a certain book x, he follows the steps described below.

  1. He lifts all the books above book x. 
  2. He pushes book x out of the stack. 
  3. He puts down the lifted books without changing their order. 
  4. After reading book x, he puts book x on the top of the stack.

He decided to read books for m days. In the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ m) day, he will read the book that is numbered with integer bj (1 ≤ bj ≤ n). To read the book, he has to use the process described in the paragraph above. It is possible that he decides to re-read the same book several times.

After making this plan, he realized that the total weight of books he should lift during m days would be too heavy. So, he decided to change the order of the stacked books before the New Year comes, and minimize the total weight. You may assume that books can be stacked in any possible order. Note that book that he is going to read on certain step isn't considered as lifted on that step. Can you help him?

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — the number of books, and the number of days for which Jaehyun would read books.

The second line contains n space-separated integers w1, w2, ..., wn (1 ≤ wi ≤ 100) — the weight of each book.

The third line contains m space separated integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bj ≤ n) — the order of books that he would read. Note that he can read the same book more than once.

Output

Print the minimum total weight of books he should lift, which can be achieved by rearranging the order of stacked books.

Examples

Input

3 5
1 2 3
1 3 2 3 1


Output

12

Note

Here's a picture depicting the example. Each vertical column presents the stacked books.

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
w = map(int, raw_input().split())
b = map(int, raw_input().split())
a = [1014] * n
curr = 0
prev = 0
for i in xrange(m):
    if a[b[i] - 1] == 501:
        prev = func_1(list(set(b[:i])), w)
    else:
        prev = func_1(list(set(b[a[b[i] - 1] + 1:i])), w)
    a[b[i] - 1] = i
    curr += prev
print(curr)

def func_1(a, w):
    su1 = 0
    for x in a:
        su1 += w[x - 1]
    return su1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
