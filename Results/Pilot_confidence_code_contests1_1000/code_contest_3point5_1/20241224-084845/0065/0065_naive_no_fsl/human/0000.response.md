Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not being used to calculate the total weight of books that need to be lifted correctly. Instead, the program uses a list `a` to track some information about the indices of the books but does not properly account for the weights of the books that need to be lifted.

Let's analyze a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3 5
  1 2 3
  1 3 2 3 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  12
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Stack Order:**
   - Assume the initial order of books is `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Day-by-Day Analysis:**
   - **Day 1:** Read book 1.
     - Lifts: Books 2 and 3.
     - Total weight lifted: \(2 + 3 = 5\).
   - **Day 2:** Read book 3.
     - Lifts: Book 2.
     - Total weight lifted: \(2\).
   - **Day 3:** Read book 2.
     - Lifts: Book 3.
     - Total weight lifted: \(3\).
   - **Day 4:** Read book 3.
     - Lifts: Book 2.
     - Total weight lifted: \(2\).
   - **Day 5:** Read book 1.
     - Lifts: Books 2 and 3.
     - Total weight lifted: \(2 + 3 = 5\).

   - **Total Weight Lifted:** \(5 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 17\).

However, the program calculates the total weight incorrectly because it does not properly handle the lifting process and the reordering of books. For instance, the `a` list and the logic within the loops do not correctly reflect the weight calculations needed.

Given the above analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific input, hence the correctness is **False**.
