Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`. However, more importantly, the logic to calculate the minimum number of moves is incorrect. The current logic calculates `b - c` which might not always give the correct result. For example, consider the test case `a = 123` and `b = 4`, the correct answer should be `3` because `123 + 3 = 126` and `126 % 4 == 0`. But the current implementation would incorrectly output `4 - (123 % 4) = 1`.

To fix this, the correct logic should be to compute `((a + b - 1) // b) * b - a`. This ensures that we get the smallest number greater than or equal to `a` that is divisible by `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Corrected logic to find the minimum number of moves
        moves = ((a + b - 1) // b) * b - a
        print(moves)

func()
```

With this correction, the program will handle all cases correctly.
