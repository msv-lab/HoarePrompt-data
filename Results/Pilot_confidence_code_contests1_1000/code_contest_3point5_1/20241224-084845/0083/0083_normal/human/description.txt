You are given an integer sequence A of length N and an integer K. You will perform the following operation on this sequence Q times:

* Choose a contiguous subsequence of length K, then remove the smallest element among the K elements contained in the chosen subsequence (if there are multiple such elements, choose one of them as you like).



Let X and Y be the values of the largest and smallest element removed in the Q operations. You would like X-Y to be as small as possible. Find the smallest possible value of X-Y when the Q operations are performed optimally.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2000
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* 1 \leq Q \leq N-K+1
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.
