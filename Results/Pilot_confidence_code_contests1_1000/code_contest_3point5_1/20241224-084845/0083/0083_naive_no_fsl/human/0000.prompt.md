You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an integer sequence A of length N and an integer K. You will perform the following operation on this sequence Q times:

* Choose a contiguous subsequence of length K, then remove the smallest element among the K elements contained in the chosen subsequence (if there are multiple such elements, choose one of them as you like).



Let X and Y be the values of the largest and smallest element removed in the Q operations. You would like X-Y to be as small as possible. Find the smallest possible value of X-Y when the Q operations are performed optimally.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2000
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* 1 \leq Q \leq N-K+1
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K Q
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the smallest possible value of X-Y.

Program:
```
(n, k, q) = map(int, input().split())
a = [0] * (n + 1)
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = b[i - 1]
l = 0
r = 1000000000
res = 1000000000
while l <= r:
    m = (l + r) // 2
    ok = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ok |= func_1(a[i] - m, a[i])
    if ok == 1:
        r = m - 1
        res = m
    else:
        l = m + 1
print(res)

def func_1(l, r):
    cnt = 0
    ln = 0
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if a[i] < l:
            res += min(cnt, max(0, ln - k + 1))
            ln = 0
            cnt = 0
        else:
            ln += 1
            if a[i] <= r:
                cnt += 1
    res += min(cnt, max(0, ln - k + 1))
    if res >= q:
        return True
    return False

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
