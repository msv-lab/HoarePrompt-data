Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a suspect is lying, telling the truth, or having their status as "Not defined" is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4 1
+2
-3
+4
-1
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
Lie
Not defined
Lie
Not defined
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. Let's break down why:

1. **Variable `p` Calculation**: The variable `p` is calculated as the count of negative responses. This part is correct.

2. **Arrays `a` and `b` Initialization**: Arrays `a` and `b` are initialized to count the positive and negative responses respectively, excluding the current suspect.

3. **Array `d` Calculation**: Array `d` is calculated as the sum of positive and negative responses for each suspect, adjusted by the count of negative responses. This step is also correct.

4. **Checking Truthfulness**: The program checks if `d[abs(s[i]) - 1]` equals `m` to determine if the suspect is telling the truth or lying. However, the condition `(d[abs(s[i]) - 1] == m) != (s[i] > 0)` is incorrectly used to determine the output. 

The key issue lies in how the final decision is made. The program uses a complex conditional statement that does not accurately reflect the logic required to determine the truthfulness of each suspect based on the given conditions.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly identify the truthfulness of each suspect for some inputs, hence the correctness is **False**.
