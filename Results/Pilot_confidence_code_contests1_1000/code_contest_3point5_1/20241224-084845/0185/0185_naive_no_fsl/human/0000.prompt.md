You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and Inna love spending time together. The problem is, Seryozha isn't too enthusiastic to leave his room for some reason. But Dima and Inna love each other so much that they decided to get criminal...

Dima constructed a trap graph. He shouted: "Hey Seryozha, have a look at my cool graph!" to get his roommate interested and kicked him into the first node.

A trap graph is an undirected graph consisting of n nodes and m edges. For edge number k, Dima denoted a range of integers from lk to rk (lk ≤ rk). In order to get out of the trap graph, Seryozha initially (before starting his movements) should pick some integer (let's call it x), then Seryozha must go some way from the starting node with number 1 to the final node with number n. At that, Seryozha can go along edge k only if lk ≤ x ≤ rk.

Seryozha is a mathematician. He defined the loyalty of some path from the 1-st node to the n-th one as the number of integers x, such that if he initially chooses one of them, he passes the whole path. Help Seryozha find the path of maximum loyalty and return to his room as quickly as possible!

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 103, 0 ≤ m ≤ 3·103). Then follow m lines describing the edges. Each line contains four integers ak, bk, lk and rk (1 ≤ ak, bk ≤ n, 1 ≤ lk ≤ rk ≤ 106). The numbers mean that in the trap graph the k-th edge connects nodes ak and bk, this edge corresponds to the range of integers from lk to rk.

Note that the given graph can have loops and multiple edges.

Output

In a single line of the output print an integer — the maximum loyalty among all paths from the first node to the n-th one. If such paths do not exist or the maximum loyalty equals 0, print in a single line "Nice work, Dima!" without the quotes.

Nice work, Dima!

Note

Explanation of the first example.

Overall, we have 2 ways to get from node 1 to node 4: first you must go along the edge 1-2 with range [1-10], then along one of the two edges 2-4. 

One of them contains range [3-5], that is, we can pass through with numbers 3, 4, 5. So the loyalty of such path is 3.

If we go along edge 2-4 with range [2-7], then we can pass through with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The loyalty is 6. That is the answer.

The edge 1-2 have no influence on the answer because its range includes both ranges of the following edges.
Program:
```
from Queue import Queue

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
edges = []
events = []
for i in range(m):
    (ak, bk, lk, rk) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    edges.append((lk, rk))
    graph[ak - 1].append((bk - 1, i))
    graph[bk - 1].append((ak - 1, i))
    events.append(lk)
    events.append(rk)
l = 0
r = 0
resp = 0
while r < len(events):
    if r < l:
        r = l
    while r < len(events) and func_1(events[l], events[r]):
        resp = max(resp, events[r] - events[l] + 1)
        r += 1
    l += 1
if resp > 0:
    print(resp)
else:
    print('Nice work, Dima!')

def func_1(l, r):
    mark = [False] * n
    cola = Queue()
    cola.put(0)
    mark[0] = True
    while not cola.empty():
        u = cola.get()
        if u == n - 1:
            return True
        for (v, e) in graph[u]:
            if not mark[v] and edges[e][0] <= l <= r <= edges[e][1]:
                mark[v] = True
                cola.put(v)
    return False


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
