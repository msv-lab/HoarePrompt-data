You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Colossal! — exclaimed Hawk-nose. — A programmer! That's exactly what we are looking for.

Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on Saturday

Reading the book "Equations of Mathematical Magic" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: a - (a ⊕ x) - x = 0 for some given a, where ⊕ stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some x, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.

Input

Each test contains several possible values of a and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of these values.

The following t lines contain the values of parameter a, each value is an integer from 0 to 2^{30} - 1 inclusive.

Output

For each value of a print exactly one integer — the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of a appear in the input.

One can show that the number of solutions is always finite.

Example

Input

3
0
2
1073741823


Output

1
2
1073741824

Note

Let's define the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers x and y, consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes): x_k ... x_2 x_1 x_0 and y_k ... y_2 y_1 y_0. Here, x_i is the i-th bit of the number x and y_i is the i-th bit of the number y. Let r = x ⊕ y be the result of the XOR operation of x and y. Then r is defined as r_k ... r_2 r_1 r_0 where:

$$$ r_i = \left\{ \begin{aligned} 1, ~ if ~ x_i ≠ y_i \\\ 0, ~ if ~ x_i = y_i \end{aligned} \right. $$$

For the first value of the parameter, only x = 0 is a solution of the equation.

For the second value of the parameter, solutions are x = 0 and x = 2.
Program:
```
def func():
    for x in xrange(int(raw_input())):
        N = int(raw_input())
        print('%ld' % pow(2, bin(N).count('1')))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
