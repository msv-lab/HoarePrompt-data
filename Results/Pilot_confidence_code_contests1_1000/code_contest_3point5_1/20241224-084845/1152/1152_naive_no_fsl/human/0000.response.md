Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function and the dynamic programming approach used in `dp` do not accurately count the number of good subsequences.

1. The `func_1` function calculates binomial coefficients, which is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires counting subsequences that form good arrays, not combinations of elements.
2. The dynamic programming approach in `dp` is incorrect. It seems to attempt to build subsequences but does not properly account for the conditions required to form good arrays.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
2 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly handle the formation of good arrays and subsequences.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic to count good subsequences, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
