You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n people in a row. The height of the i-th person is a_i. You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.

A balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than 1. For example, let heights of chosen people be [a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ..., a_{i_k}], where k is the number of people you choose. Then the condition |a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| ≤ 1 should be satisfied for all j from 1 to k-1 and the condition |a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| ≤ 1 should be also satisfied. |x| means the absolute value of x. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.

Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of people.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the height of the i-th person.

Output

In the first line of the output print k — the number of people in the maximum balanced circle.

In the second line print k integers res_1, res_2, ..., res_k, where res_j is the height of the j-th person in the maximum balanced circle. The condition |res_{j} - res_{j + 1}| ≤ 1 should be satisfied for all j from 1 to k-1 and the condition |res_{1} - res_{k}| ≤ 1 should be also satisfied.

    ma = mem.index(max(mem))
    (out, tem) = ([ma] * mem[ma], [])

        if mem[i] < 2 and tem:
            if mem[i] == 1:

            su = sum([mem[j] for j in tem])
            if su > len(out):
                out = tem
                for j in tem[::-1]:
                    out.extend([j] * (mem[j] - 1))
            if not mem[i]:
                tem = []
            else:
                tem = [tem[-1]]
        elif mem[i]:
            tem.append(i)
    print('%d\n%s' % (len(out), ' '.join(map(str, out))))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
