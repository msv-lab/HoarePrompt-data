You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.

When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.

Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.

For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:

<image>

Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)

<image>

The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.

Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction.

Each of the following n lines contains m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9). The integer a_{i,j}, located on j-th position in the i-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern direction.

Output

Print n lines containing m integers each. The integer x_{i,j}, located on j-th position inside the i-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street.

Examples

Input

3 2 

Note

In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights.

In the second example, the answers are as follows: 

  * For the intersection of the first line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the first line and the second column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the first column <image>
  * For the intersection of the second line and the second column <image>

```
from sys import stdin, stdout

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
lines = stdin.readlines()

stdout.write('\n'.join([' '.join([str(answer_matrix[j][i]) for j in xrange(m)]) for i in xrange(n)]))

def func_1(xs):
    """example: [10,20,14,10] -> ([1,3,2,1], 3). returns list of positive integers with equivalent pairwise comparisons (<,=,>) to list."""
    xs = sorted([xs[i] * 1000 + i for i in xrange(len(xs))])
    ys = [0] * len(xs)
    last_x = None
    j = 0
    for w in xs:
        x = w / 1000
        i = w % 1000
        if x == last_x:
            ys[i] = j
        else:
            j += 1
            ys[i] = j
        last_x = x
    return (ys, j)

def func_2(i, j):
    if rows_ordered[i][0][j] > columns_ordered[j][0][i]:
        difference = rows_ordered[i][0][j] - columns_ordered[j][0][i]
        return max(rows_ordered[i][1], columns_ordered[j][1] + difference)
    else:
        difference = columns_ordered[j][0][i] - rows_ordered[i][0][j]
        return max(columns_ordered[j][1], rows_ordered[i][1] + difference)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
