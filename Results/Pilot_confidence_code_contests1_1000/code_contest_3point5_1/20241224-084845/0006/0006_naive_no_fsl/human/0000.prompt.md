You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a complete directed graph K_n with n vertices: each pair of vertices u ≠ v in K_n have both directed edges (u, v) and (v, u); there are no self-loops.

You should find such a cycle in K_n that visits every directed edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).

We can write such cycle as a list of n(n - 1) + 1 vertices v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_{n(n - 1) - 1}, v_{n(n - 1)}, v_{n(n - 1) + 1} = v_1 — a visiting order, where each (v_i, v_{i + 1}) occurs exactly once.

Find the lexicographically smallest such cycle. It's not hard to prove that the cycle always exists.

Since the answer can be too large print its [l, r] segment, in other words, v_l, v_{l + 1}, ..., v_r.

Input

The first line contains the single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, l and r (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n(n - 1) + 1, r - l + 1 ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in K_n, and segment of the cycle to print.

It's guaranteed that the total sum of n doesn't exceed 10^5 and the total sum of r - l + 1 doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case print the segment v_l, v_{l + 1}, ..., v_r of the lexicographically smallest cycle that visits every edge exactly once.

Example

Input


3
2 1 3
3 3 6
99995 9998900031 9998900031


Output


1 2 1 
1 3 2 3 
1 

Note

In the second test case, the lexicographically minimum cycle looks like: 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1.

In the third test case, it's quite obvious that the cycle should start and end in vertex 1.
Program:
```
from sys import stdout

T = int(raw_input())
for _ in xrange(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, l, r) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    l -= 1
    for i in xrange(n - 1):
        t = (n - i - 1) * 2
        if l < t:
            break
        l -= t
        r -= t
    else:
        stdout.write('1\n')
        return
    ans = [0] * (r - l)
    i += 1
    p = i + 1
    sw = 0
    for j in xrange(r):
        if sw:
            if j >= l:
                ans[j - l] = p
            p += 1
            if p > n:
                i += 1
                p = i + 1
                if i == n:
                    i = 1
        elif j >= l:
            ans[j - l] = i
        sw = 1 - sw
    stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
    stdout.write('\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
