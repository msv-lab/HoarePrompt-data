Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the segment `l` and `r` are such that the entire cycle needs to be traversed, but the segment starts from the last few edges of the cycle. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
2 1 3
3 3 6
99995 998900031 998900031
```

For the third test case, `n = 99995`, `l = 998900031`, and `r = 998900031`. The program logic does not correctly handle this scenario because it prematurely breaks out of the loop without properly calculating the segment for such cases. This leads to incorrect output, specifically printing `1` instead of the correct segment of the cycle.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles segments starting from the last few edges of the cycle, which requires more careful calculation of the starting point and ensuring the segment is printed correctly even when `l` and `r` are very close to the end of the cycle.
