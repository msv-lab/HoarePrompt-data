Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the shifting of characters in the string \( S \) by \( N \) positions in the alphabet. It handles all the given constraints and examples:

1. It reads the integer \( N \) and the string \( S \) as specified.
2. It uses the modulo operation to wrap around the alphabet correctly.
3. It iterates through each character in \( S \), finds its position in the alphabet, calculates the new position after shifting, and constructs the new string accordingly.

Since the program correctly shifts each character in the string by \( N \) positions and handles all edge cases such as wrapping around from 'Z' to 'A', the program is correct according to the problem description.
