Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of apples and pears is not sufficient to form a complete set according to the ratio 1:2:4. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the number of pears is less than 4, but it does not check if the number of apples is at least twice the number of lemons. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
8
```

According to the problem description, Nikolay should be able to use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears to make the compote (since 2 lemons require 4 apples and 8 pears). However, the program will return 0 because it incorrectly assumes that since 8 pears is more than 4, and 3 apples is more than 2*2 (which is 4), it should return 0. The correct output should be 14 (2+4+8).

To fix this, the function `func_1` needs to ensure that the number of apples is at least twice the number of lemons before proceeding with the calculation.
