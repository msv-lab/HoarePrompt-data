Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a template procedure parameter is of the generic type `T` and a variable of a specific type (other than `T`) is passed to it. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not correctly identify that a parameter is of type `T` and should match any variable type.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
void f(int, T)
void f(T, T)
void foo123(int, double, string, string)
void p(T, double)
3
int a
string s
double x123
5
f(a, a)
f(s, a)
foo(a, s, s)
f(s, x123)
proc(a)
```

The expected output for the third call `foo(a, s, s)` is `0` because `foo123` requires four parameters, but the call only provides three. However, the provided program will incorrectly output `1`.

Additionally, for the fifth call `f(s, x123)`, the program should output `1` because `f` with parameters `T, double` can match `s` (string) and `x123` (double). However, the provided program outputs `0` because it does not correctly handle the generic type `T`.

These issues indicate that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
