You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing yet another card game. This time the rules are the following. There are n cards lying in a row in front of them. The i-th card has value a_i. 

First, Alice chooses a non-empty consecutive segment of cards [l; r] (l ≤ r). After that Bob removes a single card j from that segment (l ≤ j ≤ r). The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment (a_l + a_{l + 1} + ... + a_{j - 1} + a_{j + 1} + ... + a_{r - 1} + a_r). In particular, if Alice chooses a segment with just one element, then the score after Bob removes the only card is 0.

Alice wants to make the score as big as possible. Bob takes such a card that the score is as small as possible.

What segment should Alice choose so that the score is maximum possible? Output the maximum score.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of cards.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-30 ≤ a_i ≤ 30) — the values on the cards.

Output

Print a single integer — the final score of the game.

Examples

3
-10 6 -15


Output


0

Note

In the first example Alice chooses a segment [1;5] — the entire row of cards. Bob removes card 3 with the value 10 from the segment. Thus, the final score is 5 + (-2) + (-1) + 4 = 6.

In the second example Alice chooses a segment [1;4], so that Bob removes either card 1 or 3 with the value 5, making the answer 5 + 2 + 3 = 10.

In the third example Alice can choose any of the segments of length 1: [1;1], [2;2] or [3;3]. Bob removes the only card, so the score is 0. If Alice chooses some other segment then the answer will be less than 0.
Program:
```

FAST_IO = 0
if FAST_IO:
    import io, sys, atexit
    rr = iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines()).next
    sys.stdout = _OUTPUT_BUFFER = io.BytesIO()

    @atexit.register
    def write():
        sys.__stdout__.write(_OUTPUT_BUFFER.getvalue())
else:
    rr = raw_input
rri = lambda : int(rr())
rrm = lambda : map(int, rr().split())
n = rri()
arr = rrm()
print(func_1(n, arr))

def func_1(N, A):
    NINF = float('-inf')
    dp = [NINF] * 61
    ans = 0
    for x in A:
        ndp = [NINF] * 61
        ndp[x] = max(x, 0)
        bns = NINF
        for m1 in xrange(0, x):
            bns = max(bns, dp[m1])
        for m1 in xrange(x, 31):
            bns = max(bns, dp[m1])
            ndp[m1] = max(ndp[m1], bns + x)
        dp = ndp
        for i in xrange(-30, 31):
            ans = max(ans, dp[i] - max(0, i))
    return ans


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
