Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because both participants know the shared number but you do not. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. 

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Input Analysis:**
   - Participant 1 sends pairs: (1, 2) and (3, 4).
   - Participant 2 sends pairs: (1, 5) and (6, 4).

2. **Candidate Calculation:**
   - For (1, 2) and (1, 5): The only candidate is 1.
   - For (3, 4) and (6, 4): The only candidate is 4.
   - Therefore, `cand` contains {1, 4}.

Since `cand` contains more than one element, the program checks if the maximum number of candidates per participant's set is less than or equal to 1. This condition is not met, so it prints `-1`.

However, in this case, both participants know the shared number, but you do not. Hence, the correct output should be `0`. The program incorrectly outputs `-1` in this scenario.
