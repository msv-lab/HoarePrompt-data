Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the root of the tree (the city with the lowest number) is not among the attacked cities. In such cases, the program might choose an incorrect starting city for teleportation. For instance, consider the following input:

```
7 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
3 5
3 6
3 7
2 7
```

The output of the program is `2 3`, but the correct output should be `1 3` because teleporting to city 1 and then traversing to city 7 will take 3 krons, which is the minimum time.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the starting city is either one of the attacked cities or the root of the tree if none of the attacked cities are roots. This can be achieved by checking if the root city is among the attacked cities and selecting the root if it is, otherwise, finding the closest attacked city to the root.
