Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to have some logical issues that do not fully align with the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of moves does not cover all potential cases correctly. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Minimum Element Incrementation:**
   - The program attempts to double the value of the current minimum element (`curr`) and checks if adding the counts of `cnt[curr]` and `cnt[curr + 1]` brings the count to at least `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of moves because it assumes that doubling the current minimum will always lead to the optimal solution. This is not necessarily true, especially when considering the distribution of other elements in the array.

2. **Inadequate Consideration of All Potential Cases:**
   - The program only considers doubling the current minimum and does not explore all possible sequences of incrementing and decrementing elements to achieve at least `k` equal elements. It fails to consider scenarios where decrementing the maximum elements might be more efficient.

3. **Potential Overlooking of Optimal Strategy:**
   - The logic to handle the scenario where the current minimum is incremented does not account for the possibility that decrementing the maximum elements could potentially lead to a better solution. For example, if the array has a few high values and many low values, incrementing the low values might not be the most efficient way to achieve `k` equal elements.

Given these issues, let's consider a specific example to demonstrate where the program might fail:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  6 5
  1 2 2 4 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  3
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves as 4 instead of 3.

### Explanation of the Example:
- To achieve at least 5 equal elements, we can:
  - Increment the first element from 1 to 2 (1 move).
  - Increment the first element again from 2 to 3 (2 moves).
  - Increment the fourth element from 4 to 3 (1 move).

  This results in the array `[3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]`, which has 5 threes, requiring only 3 moves.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves as 4, which indicates that the logic is flawed.

Therefore, the program is not correct and the output is:
Correctness: **False**
