Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the average of the frame representations, determines which frame representation is closest to this average, and selects the frame with the smallest index in case of ties. The constraints and input format are also handled appropriately. Given the nature of the problem and the constraints, it seems that the program will work correctly for all valid inputs.
