You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array of n integers: a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to find some non-zero integer d (-10^3 ≤ d ≤ 10^3) such that, after each number in the array is divided by d, the number of positive numbers that are presented in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size (i.e., at least ⌈n/2⌉). Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a 2.5 counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of d that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such d, print a single integer 0.

Recall that ⌈ x ⌉ represents the smallest integer that is not less than x and that zero (0) is neither positive nor negative.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3).

Output

Print one integer d (-10^3 ≤ d ≤ 10^3 and d ≠ 0) that satisfies the given condition. If there are multiple values of d that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such d, print a single integer 0.

Examples

Input

5
10 0 -7 2 6

Output

4

Input

7
0 0 1 -1 0 0 2


Output

0

Note

In the first sample, n = 5, so we need at least ⌈5/2⌉ = 3 positive numbers after division. If d = 4, the array after division is [2.5, 0, -1.75, 0.5, 1.5], in which there are 3 positive numbers (namely: 2.5, 0.5, and 1.5).

In the second sample, there is no valid d, so 0 should be printed.
Program:
```
from math import ceil

def func():
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    cond = round(n / 2.0)
    positives = set()
    negatives = set()
    p1 = 0
    n1 = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i > 0:
            p1 += 1
        if i < 0:
            n1 += 1
    if p1 < cond and n1 < cond:
        print(0)
    elif p1 >= cond:
        print(4)
    else:
        print(-4)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
