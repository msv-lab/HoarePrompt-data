Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the remaining strength of a warrior is exactly equal to the number of arrows shot in a minute. According to the problem description, if a warrior's remaining strength is exactly equal to the number of arrows shot, they should still be counted as a standing warrior until the next minute. However, the current implementation reduces the number of standing warriors by one even if the remaining strength is exactly equal to the number of arrows.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 2 1 2 1
3 3 3 3 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
5
5
5
5
```

But the current program would output:
```
3
4
4
4
4
```

This is because the program incorrectly reduces the number of standing warriors by one when the remaining strength is exactly equal to the number of arrows shot. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
