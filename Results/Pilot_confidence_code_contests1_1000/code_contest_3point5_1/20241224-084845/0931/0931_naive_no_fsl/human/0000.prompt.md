You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivar the Boneless is a great leader. He is trying to capture Kattegat from Lagertha. The war has begun and wave after wave Ivar's warriors are falling in battle.

Ivar has n warriors, he places them on a straight line in front of the main gate, in a way that the i-th warrior stands right after (i-1)-th warrior. The first warrior leads the attack.

Each attacker can take up to a_i arrows before he falls to the ground, where a_i is the i-th warrior's strength.

Lagertha orders her warriors to shoot k_i arrows during the i-th minute, the arrows one by one hit the first still standing warrior. After all Ivar's warriors fall and all the currently flying arrows fly by, Thor smashes his hammer and all Ivar's warriors get their previous strengths back and stand up to fight again. In other words, if all warriors die in minute t, they will all be standing to fight at the end of minute t.

The battle will last for q minutes, after each minute you should tell Ivar what is the number of his standing warriors.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 200 000) — the number of warriors and the number of minutes in the battle.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that represent the warriors' strengths.

The third line contains q integers k_1, k_2, …, k_q (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^{14}), the i-th of them represents Lagertha's order at the i-th minute: k_i arrows will attack the warriors.

Output

Output q lines, the i-th of them is the number of standing warriors after the i-th minute.

Note

In the first example: 

  * after the 1-st minute, the 1-st and 2-nd warriors die. 
  * after the 2-nd minute all warriors die (and all arrows left over are wasted), then they will be revived thus answer is 5 — all warriors are alive. 
  * after the 3-rd minute, the 1-st warrior dies. 
  * after the 4-th minute, the 2-nd warrior takes a hit and his strength decreases by 1. 
  * after the 5-th minute, the 2-nd warrior dies. 
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, q) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    arr2 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    ans = n
    z = 0
    while j < q:
        flag = 0
        k = arr2[j]
        sum1 = -z
        while sum1 + arr1[i] <= k:
            sum1 += arr1[i]
            ans -= 1
            i += 1
            if ans == 0 and sum1 <= k:
                flag = 1
                ans = n
                i = 0
                break
        if sum1 == k:
            z = 0
        elif sum1 + arr1[i] > k and flag == 0:
            z = k - sum1
        print(ans)
        j += 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
