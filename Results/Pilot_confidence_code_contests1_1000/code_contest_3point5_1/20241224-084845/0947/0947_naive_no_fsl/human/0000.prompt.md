You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers x and y. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points |x| and |y| on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points |x - y| and |x + y| and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.

Here |z| denotes the absolute value of z.

Now, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: "What are the values of x and y?" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these n integers such that the legend could be true if x and y were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of choices.

The second line contains n pairwise distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the choices Jose is considering.

Output

Print a single integer number — the number of unordered pairs \\{x, y\} formed by different numbers from Jose's choices that could make the legend true.

Examples

2
3 6


Output


1

Note

Consider the first sample. For the pair \{2, 5\}, the situation looks as follows, with the Arrayland markers at |2| = 2 and |5| = 5, while the Vectorland markers are located at |2 - 5| = 3 and |2 + 5| = 7:

<image>

The legend is not true in this case, because the interval [2, 3] is not conquered by Vectorland. For the pair \{5, -3\} the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval [3, 5] and Vectorland consisting of the interval [2, 8]:

<image>

As Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair \{2, -3\}, for a total of two pairs.

In the second sample, the only pair is \{3, 6\}, and the situation looks as follows:

<image>

Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share 3 as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.
Program:
```
import fileinput

func_3()

def func_1(a):
    print(a)

def func_2(s, I):
    return int(s.split(' ')[I])

def func_3():
    z = 0
    N = 0
    A = 0
    I = 0
    o = 0
    for l in fileinput.input():
        z += 1
        if z < 2:
            N = int(l)
        else:
            A = map(int, l.split(' '))
    for i in range(N):
        A[i] = abs(A[i])
    A.sort()
    for i in range(N):
        while I < N and A[i] * 2 >= A[I]:
            I += 1
        o += I - i - 1
    func_1(o)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
