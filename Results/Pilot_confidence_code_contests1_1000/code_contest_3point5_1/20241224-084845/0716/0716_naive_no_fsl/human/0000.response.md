Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Specifically, the program seems to be focused on finding the median of adjacent elements in the sequence and calculating the score difference, but it does not address the core requirement of minimizing the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn by merging pages.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  4 6
  1 2 3 4 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will attempt to find the median of adjacent elements and calculate the score difference, but it will not produce the correct result.

Let's break down why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Pages to Turn**:
   - The program tries to find the median of each segment of the sequence and calculates the score difference, but it does not consider the global optimal solution for merging pages to minimize the total number of pages turned.

2. **Lack of Merging Logic**:
   - The program does not include logic to merge pages in a way that minimizes the total number of pages turned. It simply calculates the score difference based on the median of segments, which is not the optimal approach.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 2 3 4 3 2`, the correct solution involves merging page 4 to page 3. After merging, the sequence becomes `{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2}`, and the total number of pages turned is `3`. However, the current program does not perform this merge operation and thus does not compute the correct result.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem and hence is **incorrect**.
