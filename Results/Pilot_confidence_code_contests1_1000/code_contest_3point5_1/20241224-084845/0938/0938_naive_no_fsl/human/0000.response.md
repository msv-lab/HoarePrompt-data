Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to reach a ball with the integer \( K \). Specifically, the program checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the array elements is 1 and whether \( K \) is present in the array or if \((K - a) \% \text{gcd} == 0\) for any element \(a\). However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3 5
6 9 3
```

The program will output `POSSIBLE` because the gcd of 6, 9, and 3 is 3, and \( (5 - 3) \% 3 == 0 \). However, the correct answer should be `IMPOSSIBLE` because the only numbers that can be generated through the operations are multiples of 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9), and 5 is not a multiple of 3.

The program fails to handle cases where the target \( K \) cannot be generated regardless of the gcd. For example, if \( K \) is not a multiple of the gcd of the initial set of numbers, it will incorrectly suggest that it is possible to generate \( K \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
