You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a tree consisting of n vertices. A tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph.

<image> Example of a tree.

You have to paint each vertex into one of three colors. For each vertex, you know the cost of painting it in every color.

You have to paint the vertices so that any path consisting of exactly three distinct vertices does not contain any vertices with equal colors. In other words, let's consider all triples (x, y, z) such that x ≠ y, y ≠ z, x ≠ z, x is connected by an edge with y, and y is connected by an edge with z. The colours of x, y and z should be pairwise distinct. Let's call a painting which meets this condition good.

You have to calculate the minimum cost of a good painting and find one of the optimal paintings. If there is no good painting, report about it.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices.

The second line contains a sequence of integers c_{1, 1}, c_{1, 2}, ..., c_{1, n} (1 ≤ c_{1, i} ≤ 10^{9}), where c_{1, i} is the cost of painting the i-th vertex into the first color.

The third line contains a sequence of integers c_{2, 1}, c_{2, 2}, ..., c_{2, n} (1 ≤ c_{2, i} ≤ 10^{9}), where c_{2, i} is the cost of painting the i-th vertex into the second color.

The fourth line contains a sequence of integers c_{3, 1}, c_{3, 2}, ..., c_{3, n} (1 ≤ c_{3, i} ≤ 10^{9}), where c_{3, i} is the cost of painting the i-th vertex into the third color.

Then (n - 1) lines follow, each containing two integers u_j and v_j (1 ≤ u_j, v_j ≤ n, u_j ≠ v_j) — the numbers of vertices connected by the j-th undirected edge. It is guaranteed that these edges denote a tree.

Output

If there is no good painting, print -1.

Otherwise, print the minimum cost of a good painting in the first line. In the second line print n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 3), where the i-th integer should denote the color of the i-th vertex. If there are multiple good paintings with minimum cost, print any of them.

Note

All vertices should be painted in different colors in the first example. The optimal way to do it is to paint the first vertex into color 1, the second vertex — into color 3, and the third vertex — into color 2. The cost of this painting is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
