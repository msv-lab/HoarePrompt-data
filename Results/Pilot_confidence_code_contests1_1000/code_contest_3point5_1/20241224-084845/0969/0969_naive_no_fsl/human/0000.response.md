Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the city is the closest to the smallest or largest coordinate in the list. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum and maximum distances based on removing the current city from the list and comparing distances to the next closest and farthest cities. However, this approach fails to consider the edge cases where the city might be the closest to the smallest or largest coordinate directly.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-5 -2 2
```

The output of the given program would be:
```
3 7
3 3
3 7
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3 7
3 3
5 7
```

In this case, the city at position -2 has a minimum distance of 3 to the city at -5 and a maximum distance of 3 to itself (since it cannot send a letter to itself). The city at position 2 has a minimum distance of 5 to the city at -5 and a maximum distance of 7 to the city at -2.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
