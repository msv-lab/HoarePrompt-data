You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: All cities of Lineland are located on the Ox coordinate axis. Thus, each city is associated with its position xi — a coordinate on the Ox axis. No two cities are located at a single point.

Lineland residents love to send letters to each other. A person may send a letter only if the recipient lives in another city (because if they live in the same city, then it is easier to drop in).

Strange but true, the cost of sending the letter is exactly equal to the distance between the sender's city and the recipient's city.

For each city calculate two values ​​mini and maxi, where mini is the minimum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city, and maxi is the the maximum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cities in Lineland. The second line contains the sequence of n distinct integers x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 109 ≤ xi ≤ 109), where xi is the x-coordinate of the i-th city. All the xi's are distinct and follow in ascending order.

Output

Print n lines, the i-th line must contain two integers mini, maxi, separated by a space, where mini is the minimum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city, and maxi is the maximum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city.

    valores = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    for i in valores:
        distancias = []
        aux = valores[:]
        aux.remove(i)
        if abs(i - min(aux)) > abs(i - max(aux)):
            print(str(abs(i - max(aux))) + ' ' + str(abs(i - min(aux))))
        else:
            print(str(abs(i - min(aux))) + ' ' + str(abs(i - max(aux))))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
