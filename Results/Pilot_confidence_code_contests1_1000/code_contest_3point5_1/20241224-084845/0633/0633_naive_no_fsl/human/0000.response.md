Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the binary search implementation used to determine the maximum number of hamburgers Polycarpus can make has an incorrect upper bound (`10^15`). The problem description states that `r` (the number of rubles Polycarpus has) can be up to `10^12`, so using `10^15` as the upper bound in the binary search will lead to incorrect results for some cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
BBBSSC
6 4 1
1 2 3
1000000000000
```

In this case, the correct answer should be `3` because Polycarpus can buy enough ingredients to make 3 hamburgers. However, the current implementation might fail to find this solution due to the large upper bound in the binary search.

To fix this issue, the upper bound for the binary search should be adjusted to `10^12` to match the constraints of the problem.
