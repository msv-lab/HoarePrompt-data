You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarpus loves hamburgers very much. He especially adores the hamburgers he makes with his own hands. Polycarpus thinks that there are only three decent ingredients to make hamburgers from: a bread, sausage and cheese. He writes down the recipe of his favorite "Le Hamburger de Polycarpus" as a string of letters 'B' (bread), 'S' (sausage) и 'C' (cheese). The ingredients in the recipe go from bottom to top, for example, recipe "ВSCBS" represents the hamburger where the ingredients go from bottom to top as bread, sausage, cheese, bread and sausage again.

Polycarpus has nb pieces of bread, ns pieces of sausage and nc pieces of cheese in the kitchen. Besides, the shop nearby has all three ingredients, the prices are pb rubles for a piece of bread, ps for a piece of sausage and pc for a piece of cheese.

Polycarpus has r rubles and he is ready to shop on them. What maximum number of hamburgers can he cook? You can assume that Polycarpus cannot break or slice any of the pieces of bread, sausage or cheese. Besides, the shop has an unlimited number of pieces of each ingredient.

Input

The first line of the input contains a non-empty string that describes the recipe of "Le Hamburger de Polycarpus". The length of the string doesn't exceed 100, the string contains only letters 'B' (uppercase English B), 'S' (uppercase English S) and 'C' (uppercase English C).

The second line contains three integers nb, ns, nc (1 ≤ nb, ns, nc ≤ 100) — the number of the pieces of bread, sausage and cheese on Polycarpus' kitchen. The third line contains three integers pb, ps, pc (1 ≤ pb, ps, pc ≤ 100) — the price of one piece of bread, sausage and cheese in the shop. Finally, the fourth line contains integer r (1 ≤ r ≤ 1012) — the number of rubles Polycarpus has.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

Print the maximum number of hamburgers Polycarpus can make. If he can't make any hamburger, print 0.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
