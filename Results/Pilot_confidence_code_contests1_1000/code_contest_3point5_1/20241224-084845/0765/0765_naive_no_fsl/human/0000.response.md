Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program sorts the cards in descending order before distributing them between Alice and Bob. This approach does not necessarily yield the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize her score minus Bob's score.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
2 7 4
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy involves alternating turns to ensure that Alice can maximize her score. For this specific input, the optimal distribution would be:

- Alice takes the highest card (7).
- Bob takes the next highest card (4).
- Alice takes the last remaining card (2).

This results in Alice's score being 9 (7 + 2) and Bob's score being 4. Therefore, Alice's score minus Bob's score is 5.

However, the program sorts the cards as [7, 4, 2] and distributes them as follows:
- Alice takes 7.
- Bob takes 2.
- Alice takes 4.

This results in Alice's score being 11 (7 + 4) and Bob's score being 2. Therefore, Alice's score minus Bob's score is 9.

The program does not correctly implement the alternating strategy to achieve the optimal score difference. Thus, the program is incorrect.
