You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a country with n citizens. The i-th of them initially has a_{i} money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.

Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than x are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly x money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.

You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the numer of citizens.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the initial balances of citizens.

The next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of events.

Each of the next q lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.

Each event is described as either 1 p x (1 ≤ p ≤ n, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}), or 2 x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the p-th person becomes equal to x. In the second case we have a payoff with parameter x.

Output

Print n integers — the balances of all citizens after all events.

Examples

Input


4
1 2 3 4
3
2 3
1 2 2
2 1


Output


3 2 3 4 


Input


5
3 50 2 1 10
3
1 2 0
2 8
1 3 20


Output


8 8 20 8 10 

Note

In the first example the balances change as follows: 1 2 3 4 → 3 3 3 4 → 3 2 3 4 → 3 2 3 4

In the second example the balances change as follows: 3 50 2 1 10 → 3 0 2 1 10 → 8 8 8 8 10 → 8 8 20 8 10

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
