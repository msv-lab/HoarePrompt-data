Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program seems to handle the problem correctly based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Wealth Setup**: The program starts by reading the initial wealth of each citizen and storing it in the list `a`.
2. **Event Processing**:
   - For event type 1 (`1 p x`), the program updates the balance of the `p`-th citizen to `x`.
   - For event type 2 (`2 x`), the program finds the maximum balance among all citizens that are below `x` and updates their balances to `x`.

The program maintains a variable `ma` to keep track of the latest event of type 2 (payout) and processes the receipts and payouts in the correct order. This ensures that any citizen who had less than `x` after a type 2 event will be updated to have exactly `x` after the event.

### Potential Cases Checked:
- **Case 1**: Initial setup and simple receipts without any payouts.
- **Case 2**: Multiple receipts and payouts in sequence.
- **Case 3**: A combination of receipts and payouts where the payout affects the subsequent receipts.

Given the structure of the program and the way it handles both types of events, it appears to correctly restore the balances for all citizens based on the given events. There do not seem to be any missing edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the program to fail under the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
