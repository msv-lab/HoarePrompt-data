You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mike and Ann are sitting in the classroom. The lesson is boring, so they decided to play an interesting game. Fortunately, all they need to play this game is a string s and a number k (0 ≤ k < |s|).

At the beginning of the game, players are given a substring of s with left border l and right border r, both equal to k (i.e. initially l=r=k). Then players start to make moves one by one, according to the following rules:

  * A player chooses l^{\prime} and r^{\prime} so that l^{\prime} ≤ l, r^{\prime} ≥ r and s[l^{\prime}, r^{\prime}] is lexicographically less than s[l, r]. Then the player changes l and r in this way: l := l^{\prime}, r := r^{\prime}.
  * Ann moves first.
  * The player, that can't make a move loses.



Recall that a substring s[l, r] (l ≤ r) of a string s is a continuous segment of letters from s that starts at position l and ends at position r. For example, "ehn" is a substring (s[3, 5]) of "aaaehnsvz" and "ahz" is not.

Mike and Ann were playing so enthusiastically that they did not notice the teacher approached them. Surprisingly, the teacher didn't scold them, instead of that he said, that he can figure out the winner of the game before it starts, even if he knows only s and k.

Unfortunately, Mike and Ann are not so keen in the game theory, so they ask you to write a program, that takes s and determines the winner for all possible k.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

Print |s| lines.

In the line i write the name of the winner (print Mike or Ann) in the game with string s and k = i, if both play optimally

Examples

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
