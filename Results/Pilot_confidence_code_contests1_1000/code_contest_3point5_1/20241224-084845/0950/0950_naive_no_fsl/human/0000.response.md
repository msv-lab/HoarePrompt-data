Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the string `s` and the starting index `k` is flawed. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute minimum values (`m`) but does not correctly handle the game logic.
   - The function `func_2` is called to print the winner based on a comparison that does not align with the game rules. It checks if `i` (the character at position `k`) is less than or equal to `t`, which is computed as the minimum value up to the current index. This does not accurately reflect the game's rule of finding a lexicographically smaller substring.

2. **Example Case where the Program Fails:**
   - Consider the string `s = "abba"` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description:
     - Initially, `l = r = 2` and the substring is `"b"`.
     - Ann can choose `l' = 0` and `r' = 0` because `"a"` is lexicographically smaller than `"b"`.
     - After Ann's move, `l = 0` and `r = 0`, and now Mike cannot make a move because no substring starting at `k=2` can be lexicographically smaller than `"b"`.
     - Therefore, Ann wins.

   However, the program incorrectly prints "Mike" as the winner for `k = 2`.

To fix the program, we need to correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_winner(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    # Initialize dp array
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = 1 if i == 0 else dp[i-1]
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j] > s[i]:
                dp[i] = 0
                break
                
    for k in range(n):
        if dp[k]:
            print("Mike")
        else:
            print("Ann")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = input()
    determine_winner(s)
```

This corrected version initializes a DP array to keep track of whether the player who starts at position `k` can force a win. If `dp[k]` is 1, it means the player who starts at `k` can force a win; otherwise, the opponent can force a win.
