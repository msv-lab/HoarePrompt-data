Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the requirement to check for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals. Specifically, the program only checks for sequences starting from index `i` and moving forward, but it fails to check sequences that might start from later indices and move backward. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
16
.**.*..*.***.**
```
The correct answer should be "yes" because there is a valid sequence of five platforms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. However, the current implementation might miss this sequence if it starts checking from index 11 or later.

To fix this, the program needs to handle both forward and backward sequences.
