Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the reversal process described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only reverses elements at even-indexed steps, but the problem requires reversing segments from the i-th to (n - i + 1)-th position for each i from 1 to n//2. 

For example, consider the input:

```
7
4 3 7 6 9 1 2
```

The expected output is:

```
2 3 9 6 7 1 4
```

However, the program provided will not produce this output because it does not handle the reversal process as specified. It only swaps elements at even steps, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.
