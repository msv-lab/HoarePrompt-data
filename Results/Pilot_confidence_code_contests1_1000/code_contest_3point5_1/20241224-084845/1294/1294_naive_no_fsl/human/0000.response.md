Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is an odd number. Specifically, the function `func_1(x)` always returns the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, which is not always correct for determining the number of participants competing in the current round.

For example, consider the input `(5, 2, 3)`:
- The first round should have 4 participants competing (since 4 is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5).
- According to the problem description, the other participant should move directly to the next round.

However, the current implementation of `func_1(x)` will incorrectly return 2 (the largest power of 2 less than 5), leading to 2 matches in the first round instead of 1 match plus 1 direct winner.

To fix this, the function `func_1(x)` should return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and ensure that if `x` is odd, one participant moves directly to the next round without participating in a match.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1(x)`:

```python
def func_1(x):
    i = 0
    while potencias[i] <= x:
        i += 1
    return potencias[i - 1] if x % 2 == 0 else potencias[i - 2]
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
