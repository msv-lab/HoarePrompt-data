Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to check for the possibility of improving the string `a` by swapping characters when `a` is already lexicographically smaller than `b`. Here's a case where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the test case:
```
3
AZAMON APPLE
AZAMON AAAAAAAAAAALIBABA
APPLE BANANA
```

The program outputs:
```
AMAZON
---
APPLE
```

For the second test case (`AZAMON AAAAAAAAAAALIBABA`):
- The program compares the first characters and finds that both start with 'A', so it moves to the next character.
- It then checks the second character and finds that both are 'Z' and 'A', respectively. Since 'Z' is greater than 'A', it incorrectly prints '---' instead of checking further characters or trying to swap any characters.

A correct approach would involve checking if a swap can make the string lexicographically smaller and handling cases where no swap is needed. The current implementation lacks this comprehensive logic.
