You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On a number line there are n balls. At time moment 0 for each ball the following data is known: its coordinate xi, speed vi (possibly, negative) and weight mi. The radius of the balls can be ignored.

The balls collide elastically, i.e. if two balls weighing m1 and m2 and with speeds v1 and v2 collide, their new speeds will be: 

<image>.

Your task is to find out, where each ball will be t seconds after.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 0 ≤ t ≤ 100) — amount of balls and duration of the process. Then follow n lines, each containing three integers: xi, vi, mi (1 ≤ |vi|, mi ≤ 100, |xi| ≤ 100) — coordinate, speed and weight of the ball with index i at time moment 0.

It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same coordinate initially. Also each collision will be a collision of not more than two balls (that is, three or more balls never collide at the same point in all times from segment [0;t]).

Output

Output n numbers — coordinates of the balls t seconds after. Output the numbers accurate to at least 4 digits after the decimal point.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
