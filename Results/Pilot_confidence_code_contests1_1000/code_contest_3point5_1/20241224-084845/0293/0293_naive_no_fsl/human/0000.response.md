Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and the logic for determining the number of valid switch configurations. Specifically, the `func_1` function computes the dot product of two binary vectors, which is used to check if the number of "on" switches connected to each bulb is congruent to \( p_i \) modulo 2. However, the way the switch states are checked against the bulb conditions is flawed.

The issue lies in how the list `s2` is updated. After checking each configuration `s` against the current bulb condition `p`, only those configurations that satisfy the condition are kept. This process should ensure that all remaining configurations light all the bulbs. However, the program does not ensure that after processing all bulbs, the remaining configurations indeed light all the bulbs.

Let's consider the following example:

Input:
```
2 3
2 1 2
1 1
1 2
0 0 1
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation:
- Bulb 1 is connected to switches 1 and 2, and it should be lit if an odd number of them are "on".
- Bulb 2 is connected to switch 1, and it should be lit if an even number of them are "on".
- Bulb 3 is connected to switch 2, and it should be lit if an even number of them are "on".

For the first bulb, we need an odd number of "on" switches. For the second bulb, we need an even number of "on" switches. For the third bulb, we need an even number of "on" switches.

The program will incorrectly count some configurations as valid because it does not ensure that all bulbs are lit after processing each one.

To fix this, you would need to ensure that after processing all bulbs, all remaining configurations indeed light all the bulbs. This can be done by ensuring that the final set of configurations satisfies the conditions for all bulbs simultaneously.
