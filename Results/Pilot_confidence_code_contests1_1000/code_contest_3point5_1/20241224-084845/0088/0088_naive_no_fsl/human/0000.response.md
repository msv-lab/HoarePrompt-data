Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This alone would make the program incorrect, but let's assume the intention was to handle Python 3 with `input()`.

2. **Logic for Counting Operations**: The logic for counting the number of operations is flawed. The program only considers the elements from the middle index (`idx`) to the end of the array if `newdata[idx] < s` and from the start to the middle index if `newdata[idx] > s`. However, it does not account for the total number of operations needed to adjust all elements to `s`.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
7 20
21 15 12 11 20 19 12
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
```

This happens because the program only counts the operations needed to adjust the elements from the middle index to the end if the middle element is less than `s`, and from the start to the middle index if the middle element is greater than `s`. It does not consider the total number of operations needed to adjust all elements to `s`.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the total number of operations required to adjust all elements to `s`, considering both directions from the middle element.
