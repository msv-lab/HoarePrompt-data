Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the count of characters in `b` and `c` exceeds the available characters in `a`. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings of `b` and `c` that can be placed in `a`, but it does not ensure that the remaining characters in `a` are used optimally to maximize the number of such substrings.

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
aaabbbccc
a
b
```

Expected Output:
```
aabababcbbcc
```

However, the program will output:
```
aabababcc
```

This is incorrect because it does not use all the characters in `a` to form as many non-overlapping substrings of `b` and `c` as possible. The program should place `b` and `c` in such a way that maximizes their occurrences while ensuring that all characters in `a` are utilized optimally.
