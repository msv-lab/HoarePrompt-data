Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks for at least three consecutive doublets in the sequence of dice rolls. It iterates through the input, tracking the number of consecutive doublets found. If it finds three consecutive doublets, it prints 'Yes' and stops further checking. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible triplets, it prints 'No'. 

The logic in the program correctly implements the requirement to check for at least three consecutive doublets. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles all cases appropriately without missing any edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
