Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `cost` and the logic within `func_3` do not account for the possibility of changing one element to achieve the minimum number of operations.

### Analysis:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The `cost` function calculates the number of operations needed to make the array uniform starting from a given configuration. This is correct.
2. **Changing One Element**: The logic in `func_3` only changes the first few elements (`arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[-2]`, `arr[-1]`) to their adjacent values and then calculates the cost. However, this approach is incomplete and does not consider all possible ways to change one element to minimize the cost.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`.

- **Original Array**: `[1, 3, 2]`
- **Possible Changes**:
  - Change `arr[0]` to `arr[1]`: `[3, 3, 2]`. Cost: `abs(3-3) + abs(2-3) = 1`.
  - Change `arr[1]` to `arr[0]`: `[1, 1, 2]`. Cost: `abs(1-1) + abs(2-1) = 1`.
  - Change `arr[2]` to `arr[1]`: `[1, 3, 3]`. Cost: `abs(3-3) + abs(3-3) = 0`.
  - Change `arr[2]` to `arr[0]`: `[1, 3, 1]`. Cost: `abs(3-1) + abs(1-1) = 2`.

The minimum cost here is 0, which can be achieved by changing `arr[2]` to `arr[1]`. However, the provided code does not consider this scenario and instead only considers the first few elements, leading to a wrong result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
