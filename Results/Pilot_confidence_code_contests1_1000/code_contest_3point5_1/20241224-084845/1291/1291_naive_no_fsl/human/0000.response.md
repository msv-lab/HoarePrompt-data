Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the correct way to make all chemical volumes equal using the allowed operations (doubling or halving).

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Doubling and Halving Logic**: The program attempts to double and halve the volumes but does not handle the halving operation correctly. When halving, it uses `c //= 2`, which performs integer division, but it does not consider the scenario where the volume becomes 1 and cannot be further halved.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of operations required to reach certain volumes but does not ensure that all volumes become equal. It only checks for volumes that can be reached by doubling and halving starting from the initial volumes.

3. **Example Case Failing**: Consider the input `3` `3 5 6`. According to the problem description, the optimal solution is to divide the first chemical volume by two, and divide the second and third chemical volumes by two twice to make all the volumes equal 1. However, the program does not achieve this. Instead, it might incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations without ensuring all volumes become equal.

For instance, with the input `3` `3 5 6`, the program might output a value other than 5, indicating it does not correctly implement the required logic to make all volumes equal.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to meet the problem's requirements for making all chemical volumes equal using the specified operations.
