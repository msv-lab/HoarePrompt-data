You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr loves Chemistry, and specially doing experiments. He is preparing for a new interesting experiment.

Amr has n different types of chemicals. Each chemical i has an initial volume of ai liters. For this experiment, Amr has to mix all the chemicals together, but all the chemicals volumes must be equal first. So his task is to make all the chemicals volumes equal.

To do this, Amr can do two different kind of operations. 

  * Choose some chemical i and double its current volume so the new volume will be 2ai
  * Choose some chemical i and divide its volume by two (integer division) so the new volume will be <image>



Suppose that each chemical is contained in a vessel of infinite volume. Now Amr wonders what is the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal?

Input

The first line contains one number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of chemicals.

The second line contains n space separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105), representing the initial volume of the i-th chemical in liters.

Output

Output one integer the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal.

Examples

Input

3
4 8 2


Output

2

Input

3
3 5 6


Output

5

Note

In the first sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the second chemical volume by two, and multiply the third chemical volume by two to make all the volumes equal 4.

In the second sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the first chemical volume by two, and divide the second and the third chemical volumes by two twice to make all the volumes equal 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = raw_input().split()
    (dic_sum, dic_num) = ({}, {})
    max_num = 2 ** 33
    for i in xrange(n):
        curr = int(s[i])
        (c, iter) = (curr, 0)
        while c > 1:
            if dic_num.has_key(c):
                dic_num[c] += 1
                dic_sum[c] += iter
            else:
                dic_num[c] = 1
                dic_sum[c] = iter
            c //= 2
            iter += 1
        (c, iter) = (curr, 0)
        while c <= max_num:
            c *= 2
            iter += 1
            if dic_num.has_key(c):
                dic_num[c] += 1
                dic_sum[c] += iter
            else:
                dic_num[c] = 1
                dic_sum[c] = iter
    a = dic_num.items()
    s = 10 ** 12
    for i in xrange(len(a)):
        if a[i][1] == n:
            s = min(s, dic_sum[a[i][0]])
    print(s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
