Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly reverse the signs of all variables as described in the problem statement. The logic in `func_7` attempts to reverse the signs of pairs of variables but does not ensure that all variables will eventually have their signs flipped. Specifically, the current implementation only flips the signs of specific pairs without ensuring that all variables are processed.

To demonstrate why this solution is incorrect, consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```

Expected output:
- Each variable should be negated:
  ```
  -1 -2 -3 -4
  ```

However, the provided code will produce an incorrect sequence of operations. For example, the operations for the first pair (1, 4) might look like:
- Step 1: `1 1 4` (flip sign of 1)
- Step 2: `1 1 4` (flip sign of 1 again, no change)
- Step 3: `1 1 4` (flip sign of 1 again, no change)
- Step 4: `1 1 4` (flip sign of 1 again, no change)
- Step 5: `2 1 4` (subtract 1 from 4, no change)
- Step 6: `1 1 4` (flip sign of 1, no change)

This sequence does not guarantee that all variables will be negated. Therefore, the solution does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
