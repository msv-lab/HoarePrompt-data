You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: <image>

While trading on his favorite exchange trader William realized that he found a vulnerability. Using this vulnerability he could change the values of certain internal variables to his advantage. To play around he decided to change the values of all internal variables from a_1, a_2, …, a_n to -a_1, -a_2, …, -a_n. For some unknown reason, the number of service variables is always an even number.

William understands that with his every action he attracts more and more attention from the exchange's security team, so the number of his actions must not exceed 5 000 and after every operation no variable can have an absolute value greater than 10^{18}. William can perform actions of two types for two chosen variables with indices i and j, where i < j:

  1. Perform assignment a_i = a_i + a_j 
  2. Perform assignment a_j = a_j - a_i 

William wants you to develop a strategy that will get all the internal variables to the desired values.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), which is the number of internal variables.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are initial values of internal variables.

Output

For each test case print the answer in the following format:

The first line of output must contain the total number of actions k, which the strategy will perform. Note that you do not have to minimize k. The inequality k ≤ 5 000 must be satisfied. 

Each of the next k lines must contain actions formatted as "type i j", where "type" is equal to "1" if the strategy needs to perform an assignment of the first type and "2" if the strategy needs to perform an assignment of the second type. Note that i < j should hold.

We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

For the first sample test case one possible sequence of operations is as follows:

  1. "2 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, 0, 1, 1] 
  2. "2 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -1, 1, 1] 
  3. "2 1 3". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -1, 0, 1] 
  4. "2 1 3". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -1, -1, 1] 
  5. "2 1 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -1, -1, 0] 
  6. "2 1 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -1, -1, -1] 
  7. "1 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [0, -1, -1, -1] 
  8. "1 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [-1, -1, -1, -1] 



For the second sample test case one possible sequence of operations is as follows:

  1. "2 1 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [4, 3, 1, -2] 
  2. "1 2 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [4, 1, 1, -2] 
  3. "1 2 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [4, -1, 1, -2] 
  4. "1 2 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [4, -3, 1, -2] 
  5. "1 3 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [4, -3, -1, -2] 
  6. "1 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [1, -3, -1, -2] 
  7. "1 1 2". Values of variables after performing the operation: [-2, -3, -1, -2] 
  8. "1 1 4". Values of variables after performing the operation: [-4, -3, -1, -2]

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
