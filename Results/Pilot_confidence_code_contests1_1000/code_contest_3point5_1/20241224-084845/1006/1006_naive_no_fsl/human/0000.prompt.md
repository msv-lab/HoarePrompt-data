You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You want to arrange n integers a1, a2, ..., an in some order in a row. Let's define the value of an arrangement as the sum of differences between all pairs of adjacent integers.

More formally, let's denote some arrangement as a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn, where sequence x is a permutation of sequence a. The value of such an arrangement is (x1 - x2) + (x2 - x3) + ... + (xn - 1 - xn).

Find the largest possible value of an arrangement. Then, output the lexicographically smallest sequence x that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 1000).

Output

Print the required sequence x1, x2, ..., xn. Sequence x should be the lexicographically smallest permutation of a that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.

Examples

Input

5
100 -100 50 0 -50


Output

100 -50 0 50 -100 

Note

In the sample test case, the value of the output arrangement is (100 - ( - 50)) + (( - 50) - 0) + (0 - 50) + (50 - ( - 100)) = 200. No other arrangement has a larger value, and among all arrangements with the value of 200, the output arrangement is the lexicographically smallest one.

Sequence x1, x2, ... , xp is lexicographically smaller than sequence y1, y2, ... , yp if there exists an integer r (0 ≤ r < p) such that x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xr = yr and xr + 1 < yr + 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = raw_input().split()
    a = [int(a[i]) for i in range(n)]
    a.sort()
    for i in range(n):
        (print(a[n - i - 1]),)
    print('')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
