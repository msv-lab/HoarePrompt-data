Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints it in reverse order. However, this approach does not maximize the value of the arrangement as defined in the problem description. Instead, the largest and smallest elements should be placed alternately to maximize the sum of differences between adjacent elements.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
100 -100 50 0 -50
```

Expected Output:
```
100 -50 0 50 -100
```

However, the actual output of the provided program would be:
```
-100 -50 0 50 100
```

This output is not lexicographically smallest and does not maximize the value of the arrangement as described. The correct arrangement should alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements to achieve the maximum value.
