You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are organizing a boxing tournament, where n boxers will participate (n is a power of 2), and your friend is one of them. All boxers have different strength from 1 to n, and boxer i wins in the match against boxer j if and only if i is stronger than j.

The tournament will be organized as follows: n boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and n/2 winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).

Your friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.

Furthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.

The boxer with strength i can be bribed if you pay him a_i dollars. What is the minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2^{18}) — the number of boxers. n is a power of 2.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the number of dollars you have to pay if you want to bribe the boxer with strength i. Exactly one of a_i is equal to -1 — it means that the boxer with strength i is your friend. All other values are in the range [1, 10^9].

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of dollars you have to pay so your friend wins.

Examples

Input


4
3 9 1 -1


Output


0

Input


8
11 -1 13 19 24 7 17 5


Output


12

Note

In the first test case no matter how you will distribute boxers into pairs, your friend is the strongest boxer and anyway wins the tournament.

In the second test case you can distribute boxers as follows (your friend is number 2):

1 : 2, 8 : 5, 7 : 3, 6 : 4 (boxers 2, 8, 7 and 6 advance to the next stage);

2 : 6, 8 : 7 (boxers 2 and 8 advance to the next stage, you have to bribe the boxer with strength 6);

2 : 8 (you have to bribe the boxer with strength 8);
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function,division
import sys

le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
af = []
n = int(le.pop())
lo = func_1(n)
l = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
for k in range(n):
    if l[k] == -1:
        moi = k
li = func_1(moi + 1)
s = 0
for tour in range(lo, li, -1):
    mi = min(l[2 ** tour - 1:])
    l[2 ** tour - 1 + l[2 ** tour - 1:].index(mi)] = 10 ** 9
    s += mi
print(s)

def func_1(m):
    lo = 0
    p = 1
    while p <= m:
        p *= 2
        lo += 1
    return lo - 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
