You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We call two numbers x and y similar if they have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by 2), or if |x-y|=1. For example, in each of the pairs (2, 6), (4, 3), (11, 7), the numbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs (1, 4), (3, 12), they are not.

You are given an array a of n (n is even) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

For example, for the array a = [11, 14, 16, 12], there is a partition into pairs (11, 12) and (14, 16). The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ by one, and in the second pair because they are both even.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains an even positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — length of array a.

The second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

Output

For each test case print:

  * YES if the such a partition exists, 
  * NO otherwise. 



The letters in the words YES and NO can be displayed in any case.

Example

Output

YES
YES
NO

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, the two given numbers are not similar.

In the third test case, any partition is suitable.
Program:
```
def func():
    test = int(raw_input())
    for k in range(test):
        n = raw_input()
        a = map(int, raw_input().split())
        (even, odd) = (0, 0)
        for i in a:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
        if even % 2 == 0 == odd % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
            continue
        else:
            a = sorted(a)
            i = 0
            while i < len(a):
                if i + 1 < len(a) and a[i + 1] - a[i] == 1:
                    even -= 1
                    odd -= 1
                    i += 2
                else:
                    i += 1
            if even % 2 == 0 == odd % 2 == 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
