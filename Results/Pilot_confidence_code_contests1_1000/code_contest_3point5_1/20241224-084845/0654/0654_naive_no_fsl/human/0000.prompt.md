You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On his free time, Chouti likes doing some housework. He has got one new task, paint some bricks in the yard.

There are n bricks lined in a row on the ground. Chouti has got m paint buckets of different colors at hand, so he painted each brick in one of those m colors.

Having finished painting all bricks, Chouti was satisfied. He stood back and decided to find something fun with these bricks. After some counting, he found there are k bricks with a color different from the color of the brick on its left (the first brick is not counted, for sure).

So as usual, he needs your help in counting how many ways could he paint the bricks. Two ways of painting bricks are different if there is at least one brick painted in different colors in these two ways. Because the answer might be quite big, you only need to output the number of ways modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first and only line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n,m ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1) — the number of bricks, the number of colors, and the number of bricks, such that its color differs from the color of brick to the left of it.

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to color bricks modulo 998 244 353.

Examples

Input


3 3 0


Output


3


Input


3 2 1


Output


4

Note

In the first example, since k=0, the color of every brick should be the same, so there will be exactly m=3 ways to color the bricks.

In the second example, suppose the two colors in the buckets are yellow and lime, the following image shows all 4 possible colorings.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
