Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `k` is equal to `n-1`. According to the problem description, `k` is the number of bricks such that its color differs from the color of the brick to its left. When `k = n-1`, it means every brick except the last one is painted differently from the brick to its left. However, the program calculates the number of ways using a formula that does not account for this specific case correctly.

To verify this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

In this case, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 2`. The valid colorings are:
1. Yellow-Lime-Yellow
2. Lime-Yellow-Lime

The program outputs `4`, but there are only `2` valid colorings. This indicates that the program does not handle the case correctly when `k = n-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
