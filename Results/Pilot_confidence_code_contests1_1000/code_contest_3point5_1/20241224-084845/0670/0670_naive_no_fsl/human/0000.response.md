Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the input will always be a sequence of alternating colors, but it does not check the validity of the input sequence. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of ways to pick a zebroid subsequence is flawed.

To illustrate, let's consider the following cases:

1. **Input: 3**
   - Expected Output: 6
   - Explanation: For an input of 3, the possible sequences are (RBR), (BRB), etc., and the program should correctly calculate the number of ways to pick a zebroid subsequence. However, the current implementation may not handle all valid sequences correctly.

2. **Input: 4**
   - Expected Output: 11
   - Explanation: For an input of 4, the possible sequences are (RBRR), (RBRB), etc., and the program should correctly calculate the number of ways to pick a zebroid subsequence. Again, the current implementation may not handle all valid sequences correctly.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
