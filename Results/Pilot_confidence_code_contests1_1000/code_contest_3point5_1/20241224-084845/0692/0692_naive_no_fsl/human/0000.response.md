Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the weights needed to balance the given weight on the left plate using the available weights (1g, 2g, 4g, 8g, 16g, 32g, 64g, 128g, 256g, 512g). The program iterates through the powers of 2 up to 1023 and checks if each weight is necessary to match the given weight. If a weight is needed, it is added to the list. This approach ensures that the weights are output in ascending order, as required.

For example:
- When the input is `5`, the binary representation is `101` (2^2 + 2^0), so the program correctly outputs `1 4`.
- When the input is `7`, the binary representation is `111` (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0), so the program correctly outputs `1 2 4`.
- When the input is `127`, the binary representation is `1111111` (all bits are set), so the program correctly outputs `1 2 4 8 16 32 64`.

Since the program handles all cases correctly as per the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
