Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the gcd of the resulting array \( b \) will always be greater than 1 for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the gcd of the chosen pairs during the process of constructing the array \( b \).

Consider the following test case:
```
3
2
2 4 6 8
```

Expected output:
```
3 6
4 5
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
3 6
4 5
```

But the array \( b \) will be \([8, 10]\), and the gcd of \([8, 10]\) is 2, which is greater than 1. However, let's consider another scenario:

```
3
2
3 5 7 9
```

Expected output:
```
3 6
4 5
```

But the provided program will output:
```
3 6
4 5
```

Here, the array \( b \) will be \([12, 14]\), and the gcd of \([12, 14]\) is 2, which is greater than 1. However, this is not guaranteed for all cases. For instance, if we consider:

3 6
4 5
```
