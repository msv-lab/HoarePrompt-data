Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. It checks only if there is at least one odd number in the array and prints "First" without considering the overall structure and parity of the array. This logic is insufficient to determine the winner based on the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 4 6
```

In this case, the array has all even numbers, and the second player should win because the first player cannot make a valid move (there are no subsegments with an odd sum). However, the program will incorrectly output "First".

The correct approach should consider the total count of odd and even numbers and their positions to determine the winner.
