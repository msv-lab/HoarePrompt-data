Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check for the existence of a valid `h` function that satisfies the condition `h(g(x)) = f(x)` for all `x`. The program assumes that since `a[i-1]` is in the sorted set `dis`, and `a[i-1] == i`, it can directly map `g` and `h` accordingly. However, this logic is flawed because it does not guarantee that `h(g(x)) = f(x)` for all `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

The correct output should be:
```
1
1 1 1
2
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle cases where multiple elements map to the same value in `f`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
