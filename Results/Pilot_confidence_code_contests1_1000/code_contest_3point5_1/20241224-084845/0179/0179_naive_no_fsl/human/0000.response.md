Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` and its usage in `func_4` do not accurately reflect the rules of the game as described. The function `func_3` seems to be an attempt to calculate a jump size, but it does not properly handle the decrement of `maxim` and `minim` in a way that aligns with the problem statement. Additionally, the usage of `func_3` within `func_4` does not correctly accumulate the minimum number of moves required to make the first `k` elements of the sequence equal to zero.

A correct implementation would involve maintaining a dynamic programming approach where the state transition is based on the operations allowed by the problem description. The current implementation does not accurately simulate these operations and thus does not provide the correct results for the given problem.
