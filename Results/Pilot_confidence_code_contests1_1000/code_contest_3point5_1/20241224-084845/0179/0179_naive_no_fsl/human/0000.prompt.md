You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Smart Beaver from ABBYY began to develop a new educational game for children. The rules of the game are fairly simple and are described below.

The playing field is a sequence of n non-negative integers ai numbered from 1 to n. The goal of the game is to make numbers a1, a2, ..., ak (i.e. some prefix of the sequence) equal to zero for some fixed k (k < n), and this should be done in the smallest possible number of moves.

One move is choosing an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that ai > 0 and an integer t (t ≥ 0) such that i + 2t ≤ n. After the values of i and t have been selected, the value of ai is decreased by 1, and the value of ai + 2t is increased by 1. For example, let n = 4 and a = (1, 0, 1, 2), then it is possible to make move i = 3, t = 0 and get a = (1, 0, 0, 3) or to make move i = 1, t = 1 and get a = (0, 0, 2, 2) (the only possible other move is i = 1, t = 0).

You are given n and the initial sequence ai. The task is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the first k elements of the original sequence equal to zero for each possible k (1 ≤ k < n).

Input

The first input line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104), separated by single spaces.

The input limitations for getting 20 points are: 

  * 1 ≤ n ≤ 300



The input limitations for getting 50 points are: 

  * 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000



The input limitations for getting 100 points are: 

  * 1 ≤ n ≤ 105

Output

Print exactly n - 1 lines: the k-th output line must contain the minimum number of moves needed to make the first k elements of the original sequence ai equal to zero.

Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams, or the %I64d specifier.

    for k in range(1, len(inp)):
        total = 0
        for i in range(k):
            total += inp[i] * func_3(len(inp) - i - 1, k - i)
        res.append(total)
    return res

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
