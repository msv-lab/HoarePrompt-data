You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bizon the Champion isn't just a bison. He also is a favorite of the "Bizons" team.

At a competition the "Bizons" got the following problem: "You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), s and t. You need to transform word s into word t". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. 

Bizon the Champion wonders whether the "Bizons" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty word s. The second line contains a non-empty word t. Words s and t are different. Each word consists only of lowercase English letters. Each word contains at most 100 letters.

Output

In the single line print the answer to the problem. Print "need tree" (without the quotes) if word s cannot be transformed into word t even with use of both suffix array and suffix automaton. Print "automaton" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix automaton to solve the problem. Print "array" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix array to solve the problem. Print "both" (without the quotes), if you need both data structures to solve the problem.

It's guaranteed that if you can solve the problem only with use of suffix array, then it is impossible to solve it only with use of suffix automaton. This is also true for suffix automaton.

Examples

Input

automaton
tomat


Output

automaton


Input

array
arary


Output

array


Input

both
hot


Output

both


Input

need
tree


Output

need tree

Note

In the third sample you can act like that: first transform "both" into "oth" by removing the first character using the suffix automaton and then make two swaps of the string using the suffix array and get "hot".
Program:
```
func_2()

def func_1(s, s1):
    ln = len(s1)
    lll = len(s)
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < ln and j < lll:
        if s1[i] == s[j]:
            j = j + 1
        i = i + 1
    if j == lll:
        return True
    return False

def func_2():
    s = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    if ''.join(sorted(s)) == ''.join(sorted(s2)):
        print('array')
        return 0
    if func_1(s2, s) == True:
        print('automaton')
        return 0
    if func_1(sorted(s2), sorted(s)):
        print('both')
        return 0
    print('need tree')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
