Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if `s1` is a subsequence of `s` by comparing characters in order. However, it does not account for the possibility of rearranging characters using the suffix array. Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
both
hot
```

Expected output:
```
both
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
automaton
```

This is because the function `func_1` checks for a subsequence in order, and since 't' is not found after 'b' in `s`, it returns `False`. Additionally, the check for sorting the strings (`''.join(sorted(s)) == ''.join(sorted(s2))`) is only valid if the strings are anagrams, which is not the case here. Therefore, the program does not correctly identify that both suffix array and suffix automaton are needed to transform "both" into "hot".
