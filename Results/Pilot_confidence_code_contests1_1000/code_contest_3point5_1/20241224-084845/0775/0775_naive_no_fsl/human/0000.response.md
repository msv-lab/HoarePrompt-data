Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial multiset already contains the number 2048. According to the problem description, if the multiset initially contains 2048, the player wins immediately. However, the `func_2` function does not check for this condition, always appending 'No' to the result list `t`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1
2048
```

The expected output is "YES" because the number 2048 is already in the multiset. However, the program will output "No" because it does not handle this specific case.

To fix this, you can add a simple check at the beginning of `func_2` to see if 2048 is already in the multiset:

```python
def func_2(arr, t):
    f = {}
    func_1(arr, f)
    keys = f.keys()
    if 2048 in keys:
        t.append('YES')
        return
    
    for i in range(0, 11):
        k = 0
        if pow(2, i) in keys:
            k = f[pow(2, i)] // 2
        if pow(2, i + 1) in keys:
            f[pow(2, i + 1)] = f[pow(2, i + 1)] + k
        elif k > 0:
            f[pow(2, i + 1)] = k
    if 2048 in f:
        t.append('YES')
    else:
        t.append('No')
```

With this modification, the program should correctly identify the case where the multiset initially contains 2048.
