Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to count good substrings is flawed. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
5
AAABB
```

Expected output:
```
10
```

However, the program outputs:
```
9
```

### Reasoning:
- The program attempts to identify ranges where substrings ending at each position are checked for being part of a good substring.
- It incorrectly counts substrings that do not satisfy the condition of being part of at least one palindrome of length greater than 1.
- The program fails to handle the overlapping nature of palindromic substrings effectively.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves using dynamic programming to keep track of the last occurrence of each character and ensuring that each character is part of at least one valid palindrome substring.
