You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The string t_1t_2 ... t_k is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of length greater than 1.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings A, BAB, ABBA, BAABBBAAB are palindromes, but the strings AB, ABBBAA, BBBA are not.

Here are some examples of good strings: 

  * t = AABBB (letters t_1, t_2 belong to palindrome t_1 ... t_2 and letters t_3, t_4, t_5 belong to palindrome t_3 ... t_5); 
  * t = ABAA (letters t_1, t_2, t_3 belong to palindrome t_1 ... t_3 and letter t_4 belongs to palindrome t_3 ... t_4); 
  * t = AAAAA (all letters belong to palindrome t_1 ... t_5); 



You are given a string s of length n, consisting of only letters A and B.

You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string s.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the string s.

The second line contains the string s, consisting of letters A and B.

Output

Print one integer — the number of good substrings of string s.

Examples

Input


5
AABBB


Output


6


Input


3
AAA


Output


3


Input


7
AAABABB


Output


15

Note

In the first test case there are six good substrings: s_1 ... s_2, s_1 ... s_4, s_1 ... s_5, s_3 ... s_4, s_3 ... s_5 and s_4 ... s_5.

In the second test case there are three good substrings: s_1 ... s_2, s_1 ... s_3 and s_2 ... s_3.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
