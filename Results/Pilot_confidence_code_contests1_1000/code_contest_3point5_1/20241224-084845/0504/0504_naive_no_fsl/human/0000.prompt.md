You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Makes solves problems on Decoforces and lots of other different online judges. Each problem is denoted by its difficulty — a positive integer number. Difficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with difficulty d on Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficulty d on any other judge). 

Makes has chosen n problems to solve on Decoforces with difficulties a1, a2, ..., an. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order. Though he can solve problem i with difficulty ai only if he had already solved some problem with difficulty <image> (no matter on what online judge was it).

Before starting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with maximum difficulty k.

With given conditions it's easy to see that Makes sometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he chooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving problems from his list. 

For every positive integer y there exist some problem with difficulty y on at least one judge besides Decoforces.

Makes can solve problems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the chosen list one right after another.

Makes doesn't have too much free time, so he asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on other judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces.

Input

The first line contains two integer numbers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 103, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

The second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

Print minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces.

Examples

Input

3 3
2 1 9


Output

1


Input

4 20
10 3 6 3


Output

0

Note

In the first example Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3.

In the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    '\nn,k=4,20\nA=[10,3,6,3]\n'
    A.sort()
    c = 0
    for ai in A:
        while ai > 2 * k:
            k *= 2
            c += 1
        k = max(k, ai)
    print(c)
    exit()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
