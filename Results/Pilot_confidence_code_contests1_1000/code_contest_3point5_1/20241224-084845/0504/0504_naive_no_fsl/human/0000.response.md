Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required difficulty to solve a problem is more than twice the current maximum difficulty but the current maximum difficulty is already the highest possible value among the problems in the list. Specifically, the program increments `k` only when `ai > 2 * k`, which means it fails to account for scenarios where the required difficulty is more than double the current maximum difficulty but less than or equal to twice the current maximum difficulty.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 10
15 12 20
```

- Initially, `k = 10`.
- For `a1 = 15`, `15 > 2 * 10` is false, so `k` remains `10`.
- For `a2 = 12`, `12 > 2 * 10` is false, so `k` remains `10`.
- For `a3 = 20`, `20 > 2 * 10` is true, so `k` becomes `20` and `c` increments by 1.
- The final value of `c` is `1`.

However, according to the problem statement, to solve the problem with difficulty `20`, Makes needs a problem with difficulty at least `10` (since `20 > 2 * 10 / 2`), and since `k` was already `10`, he should not need to solve any additional problems. Thus, the correct output should be `0`.

The program fails to correctly handle this scenario, hence it is incorrect.
