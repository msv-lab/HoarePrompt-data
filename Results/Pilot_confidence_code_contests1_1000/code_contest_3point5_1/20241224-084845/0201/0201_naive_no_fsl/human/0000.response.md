Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to manipulate the tree structure to maximize the number of fans while ensuring connectivity among the remaining contestants. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed and does not correctly handle the removal of contestants to maintain connectivity and maximize fan count.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
1 3 4
```
However, running the provided program with this input results in an incorrect output. The program does not properly account for the removal of contestants in a way that maintains connectivity and maximizes the total number of fans.

For instance, in the given example, the program might not correctly identify the optimal set of contestants to remove while maintaining the required connectivity constraints. This suggests that the logic within `func_1` is insufficient or incorrect, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
