You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: From beginning till end, this message has been waiting to be conveyed.

For a given unordered multiset of n lowercase English letters ("multi" means that a letter may appear more than once), we treat all letters as strings of length 1, and repeat the following operation n - 1 times:

  * Remove any two elements s and t from the set, and add their concatenation s + t to the set. 



The cost of such operation is defined to be <image>, where f(s, c) denotes the number of times character c appears in string s.

Given a non-negative integer k, construct any valid non-empty set of no more than 100 000 letters, such that the minimum accumulative cost of the whole process is exactly k. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Input

The first and only line of input contains a non-negative integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100 000) — the required minimum cost.

Output

Output a non-empty string of no more than 100 000 lowercase English letters — any multiset satisfying the requirements, concatenated to be a string.

Note that the printed string doesn't need to be the final concatenated string. It only needs to represent an unordered multiset of letters.

Examples

Input

12


Output

abababab


Input

3


Output

codeforces

Note

For the multiset {'a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b'}, one of the ways to complete the process is as follows:

  * {"ab", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 0; 
  * {"aba", "b", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 1; 
  * {"abab", "a", "b", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 1; 
  * {"abab", "ab", "a", "b"}, with a cost of 0; 
  * {"abab", "aba", "b"}, with a cost of 1; 
  * {"abab", "abab"}, with a cost of 1; 
  * {"abababab"}, with a cost of 8. 



The total cost is 12, and it can be proved to be the minimum cost of the process.
Program:
```
letters = [0] * 26
k = int(raw_input())
for letter in range(26):
    if k == 0:
        break
    i = 0
    while True:
        if func_1(i) <= k:
            letters[letter] = i
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    k -= func_1(letters[letter])
let = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
st = ''
for (idx, l) in enumerate(letters):
    st += let[idx] * letters[idx]
print(st)

def func_1(number):
    if number == 0:
        return 0
    if number == 1:
        return 0
    return func_1(number - number / 2) + func_1(number / 2) + (number - number / 2) * (number / 2)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
