Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the transition rules for the states do not accurately reflect the Minesweeper 1D rules.

Consider the following test case: `?01?`. According to the problem description, the possible correct fields should be `0010`, `0011`, `0012`, `0110`, `0111`, `0112`, `0120`, `0121`, and `0122`. However, the program does not account for these possibilities correctly.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **State Transition for `?` after `0`:**
   - The program transitions from `?` to `0` as `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`. This means it assumes the next state is always `0`, but it should consider both `1` and `2` based on the previous values.
   
2. **State Transition for `?` after `1`:**
   - The program transitions from `?` to `1` as `(0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0)`. This does not account for the possibility of transitioning to `2` if the previous state had a `2`.

3. **State Transition for `?` after `2`:**
   - The program transitions from `?` to `2` as `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`. This does not account for the possibility of transitioning to `1` or `0` based on the previous state.

Given these issues, the program does not cover all valid transitions, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
