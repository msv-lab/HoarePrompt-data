You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path.

Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine.

Peter decided to tie his car to point P and now he is wondering what is the area of ​​the region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers — the number of vertices of the polygon n (<image>), and coordinates of point P.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers — coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three consecutive vertices lie on a common straight line.

All the numbers in the input are integers that do not exceed 1 000 000 in their absolute value.

Output

Print a single real value number — the area of the region that will be cleared. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

3 0 0
0 1
-1 2

Input

4 1 -1
0 0

2 0
1 1


Output

Note

In the first sample snow will be removed from that area:

<image>
Program:
```
import sys
import math
import re
from datetime import datetime
from decimal import *

sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)
startTime = datetime.now()
NP = func_3()
N = NP[0]
P = NP[1:]
minD = 1000000000000000000
maxD = 0
for i in range(N):
    X = func_3()
    d = (P[0] - X[0]) * (P[0] - X[0]) + (P[1] - X[1]) * (P[1] - X[1])
    minD = min(minD, d)
    maxD = max(maxD, d)
print + Decimal(math.pi) * (maxD - minD)

def func_1(n):
    return [raw_input().strip() for i in range(n)]

def func_2():
    return raw_input().strip()

def func_3():
    return map(int, func_2().split())

def func_4():
    return func_3()[0]

def func_5(o):
    print(o)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
