Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the region that will be cleared. Specifically, the program computes the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices of the polygon and assumes that the cleared area is a circle with radius equal to the difference between these two distances. However, this approach is incorrect because the actual cleared area is the area of the annulus (ring-shaped region) formed between two concentric circles centered at \( P \) with radii corresponding to the minimum and maximum distances from \( P \) to the polygon.

The correct approach would be to calculate the area of the circle with radius equal to the maximum distance from \( P \) to the polygon and subtract the area of the circle with radius equal to the minimum distance from \( P \) to the polygon. This is represented by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (\text{maxD}^2 - \text{minD}^2) \]

The current implementation uses `maxD - minD` instead of `maxD^2 - minD^2`, which results in an incorrect area calculation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
