Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input in the form "a:b" and processes the hours (`hs`) and minutes (`ms`) separately.

2. **Character Conversion**: The function `func_1` converts characters to their respective numerical values correctly, considering both digits and letters (A-Z).

3. **Digit Processing**: Functions `func_2` and `func_3` handle the conversion and validation of digit sequences to determine the valid radixes. These functions check if the given digits can form a valid time within the constraints (0-23 for hours and 0-59 for minutes).

4. **Combining Results**: The main function `func_4` combines the results from processing hours and minutes to determine the valid radixes that can represent the given time. It handles edge cases such as invalid inputs (like exceeding the limits of hours or minutes) and returns the appropriate output (list of valid radixes, 0, or -1).

Given the thorough checks and handling of various edge cases, the program correctly determines the valid radixes for any given input "a:b". Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
