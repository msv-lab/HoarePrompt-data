You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Having stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. "What ungentlemanly behavior!" â€” you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. 

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called "R2:D2". What can "R2:D2" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as "a:b", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.

Your task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time "a:b".

Input

The first line contains a single string as "a:b" (without the quotes). There a is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String a shows the number of hours. String b is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String b shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings a and b are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings a and b can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string "008:1" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).

We consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.

Output

Print the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time "a:b", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b", print the single integer -1.

Note that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.

Examples

Input

11:20


Output

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

Input

2A:13


Output

0


Input

000B:00001


Output

-1

Note

Let's consider the first sample. String "11:20" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. 

Let's consider the second sample test. String "2A:13" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.

Let's consider the third sample. String "000B:00001" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
