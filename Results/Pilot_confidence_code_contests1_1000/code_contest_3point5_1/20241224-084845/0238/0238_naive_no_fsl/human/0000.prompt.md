You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vanya and his friend Vova play a computer game where they need to destroy n monsters to pass a level. Vanya's character performs attack with frequency x hits per second and Vova's character performs attack with frequency y hits per second. Each character spends fixed time to raise a weapon and then he hits (the time to raise the weapon is 1 / x seconds for the first character and 1 / y seconds for the second one). The i-th monster dies after he receives ai hits. 

Vanya and Vova wonder who makes the last hit on each monster. If Vanya and Vova make the last hit at the same time, we assume that both of them have made the last hit.

Input

The first line contains three integers n,x,y (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 106) — the number of monsters, the frequency of Vanya's and Vova's attack, correspondingly.

Next n lines contain integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the number of hits needed do destroy the i-th monster.

Output

Print n lines. In the i-th line print word "Vanya", if the last hit on the i-th monster was performed by Vanya, "Vova", if Vova performed the last hit, or "Both", if both boys performed it at the same time.

Examples

Input

4 3 2
1
2
3
4


Output

Vanya
Vova
Vanya
Both


Input

2 1 1
1
2


Output

Both
Both

Note

In the first sample Vanya makes the first hit at time 1 / 3, Vova makes the second hit at time 1 / 2, Vanya makes the third hit at time 2 / 3, and both boys make the fourth and fifth hit simultaneously at the time 1.

In the second sample Vanya and Vova make the first and second hit simultaneously at time 1.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = a[0]
    x = float(a[1])
    y = float(a[2])
    monstor = []
    for i in xrange(0, n):
        monstor.append(int(raw_input()))
    MaxMonstor = max(monstor)
    order = []
    x_pointer = 1 / x
    y_pointer = 1 / y
    i = 0
    while i < MaxMonstor:
        if x_pointer == y_pointer:
            order.append('Both')
            order.append('Both')
            x_pointer = x_pointer + 1 / x
            y_pointer = y_pointer + 1 / y
            i = i + 2
            continue
        if x_pointer < y_pointer:
            order.append('Vanya')
            x_pointer = x_pointer + 1 / x
            i = i + 1
        if x_pointer > y_pointer:
            order.append('Vova')
            y_pointer = y_pointer + 1 / y
            i = i + 1
    for i in xrange(0, n):
        print(order[monstor[i] - 1])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
