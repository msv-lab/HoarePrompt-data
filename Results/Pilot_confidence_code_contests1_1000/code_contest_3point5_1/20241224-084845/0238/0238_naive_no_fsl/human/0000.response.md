Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in its approach to determining who makes the last hit on each monster. Specifically, the program assumes that the `MaxMonstor` value (which is the maximum number of hits required to destroy any monster) will determine the length of the loop, but this is incorrect. The loop should iterate based on the total number of hits required across all monsters, not just the maximum.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 3
2
3
4
```

- Vanya's attack frequency is 2 hits/second, so the time between attacks is 0.5 seconds.
- Vova's attack frequency is 3 hits/second, so the time between attacks is approximately 0.333 seconds.
- The first monster requires 2 hits.
- The second monster requires 3 hits.
- The third monster requires 4 hits.

The correct sequence of hits would be:
- First monster: Vanya (0.5 sec), Vanya (1 sec)
- Second monster: Vanya (1 sec), Vova (1.333 sec), Vova (1.667 sec)
- Third monster: Vova (1.667 sec), Vova (2.000 sec), Vova (2.333 sec), Vova (2.667 sec)

However, the program will incorrectly handle this scenario because it uses `MaxMonstor` to determine the loop length, which is 4 in this case. It will append 'Both' twice unnecessarily and may not correctly track the timing of the last hits.

The correct approach would involve iterating over the total number of hits required for all monsters and determining the order of hits based on the attack frequencies of Vanya and Vova.
