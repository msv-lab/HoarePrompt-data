Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` attempts to sort the array to find the longest increasing subsequence, but this approach is incorrect. The problem requires finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the concatenated array, not sorting the original array.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the provided program would incorrectly output the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the sorted array, which is 1 (the subsequence could be [1]). This is not the correct answer according to the problem statement.

The correct solution involves recognizing that the longest increasing subsequence in the concatenated array is at most twice the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the original array. This is because the concatenation of the array with itself allows for subsequences to span the entire length of the array multiple times.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output should be `False`.
