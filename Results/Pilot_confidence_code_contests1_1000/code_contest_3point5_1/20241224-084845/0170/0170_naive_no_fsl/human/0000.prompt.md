You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ehab has an array a of length n. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of n copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?

A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.

Input

The first line contains an integer t — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in the array a.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.

The sum of n across the test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each testcase, output the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a if you concatenate it to itself n times.

Example

Input


2
3
3 2 1
6
3 1 4 1 5 9


Output


3
5

Note

In the first sample, the new array is [3,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1]. The longest increasing subsequence is marked in bold.

In the second sample, the longest increasing subsequence will be [1,3,4,5,9].
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
for i in range(n):
    (n, a) = func_1()
    result = func_2(a, n)
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in result]))

def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()
    return (n, [int(x) for x in line.split(' ')])

def func_2(a, n):
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    result = []
    prev = None
    for x in a:
        if x != prev:
            result.append(x)
        prev = x
    return result


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
