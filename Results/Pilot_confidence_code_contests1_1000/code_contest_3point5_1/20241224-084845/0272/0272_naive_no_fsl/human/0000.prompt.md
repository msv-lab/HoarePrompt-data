You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya's bicycle chain drive consists of two parts: n stars are attached to the pedal axle, m stars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain helps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.

We know that the i-th star on the pedal axle has ai (0 < a1 < a2 < ... < an) teeth, and the j-th star on the rear wheel axle has bj (0 < b1 < b2 < ... < bm) teeth. Any pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m) is called a gear and sets the indexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear (i, j) has a gear ratio, equal to the value <image>.

Since Vasya likes integers, he wants to find such gears (i, j), that their ratios are integers. On the other hand, Vasya likes fast driving, so among all "integer" gears (i, j) he wants to choose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of such gears.

In the problem, fraction <image> denotes division in real numbers, that is, no rounding is performed.

Input

The first input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the bicycle's pedal axle. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing.

The third input line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50) — the number of stars on the rear wheel axle. The fourth line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104) in the order of strict increasing.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one gear (i, j), that its gear ratio is an integer. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.

Output

Print the number of "integer" gears with the maximum ratio among all "integer" gears.

Examples

1 2 3 4
5
10 11 12 13 14


Output

1

Note

In the first sample the maximum "integer" gear ratio equals 3. There are two gears that have such gear ratio. For one of them a1 = 4, b1 = 12, and for the other a2 = 5, b3 = 15.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
