Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the index `i` is part of the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to check if a number is in the Fibonacci sequence but rather to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n`. This results in incorrect values being stored in the `dp` dictionary, leading to wrong names being generated for Eleven.

For example, consider the input `8`. According to the problem description, the correct name should be "OOOoOooO". However, due to the incorrect implementation of checking Fibonacci numbers, the program will produce an incorrect result.
