Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if the subsequence starting from the k-th element is identical, but this is not sufficient to determine if the sequence will eventually become uniform through the described operations.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
4 2
3 1 1 2
```

According to the problem description, the shooshuns should perform operations as follows:
1. Find the 2nd element (which is 1) and append it to the end, resulting in the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 2]`.
2. Remove the first element, resulting in the sequence `[1, 1, 2]`.

The process would continue:
1. Find the 2nd element (which is 1) and append it to the end, resulting in the sequence `[1, 1, 2, 1]`.
2. Remove the first element, resulting in the sequence `[1, 2, 1]`.

This sequence will never become uniform because it contains both 1 and 2. Therefore, the correct output for this input should be `-1`, but the provided program does not handle this scenario correctly.

Hence, the program is incorrect.
