Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the circumcenter and circumradius of a triangle. The formula used to calculate `k`, `x`, and `y` appears to be incorrect. Specifically, the calculation of `k` and the subsequent values for `x` and `y` do not align with the standard formula for finding the circumcenter of a triangle. 

The correct approach to find the circumcenter \((p_x, p_y)\) and circumradius \(r\) involves using the determinant method or solving the system of equations derived from the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def circumcenter_and_radius(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3):
    D = 2 * (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2))
    A = x1 * x1 + y1 * y1
    B = x2 * x2 + y2 * y2
    C = x3 * x3 + y3 * y3
    px = (A * (y2 - y3) + B * (y3 - y1) + C * (y1 - y2)) / D
    py = (A * (x3 - x2) + B * (x1 - x3) + C * (x2 - x1)) / D
    r = math.sqrt((px - x1) ** 2 + (py - y1) ** 2)
    return (round(px, 3), round(py, 3), round(r, 3))

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        data = list(map(float, input().split()))
        x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 = data
        px, py, r = circumcenter_and_radius(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
        print(f'{px} {py} {r}')

func()
```

This corrected version uses the correct formulas for calculating the circumcenter and circumradius, ensuring that the program works as expected for all valid inputs within the given constraints.
