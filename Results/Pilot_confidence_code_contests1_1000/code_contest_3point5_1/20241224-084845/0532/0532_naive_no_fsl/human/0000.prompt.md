You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s[1 ... n] consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that n = 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0.

The string s[1 ... n] is called c-good if at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied:

  * The length of s is 1, and it consists of the character c (i.e. s_1=c);
  * The length of s is greater than 1, the first half of the string consists of only the character c (i.e. s_1=s_2=...=s_{n/2}=c) and the second half of the string (i.e. the string s_{n/2 + 1}s_{n/2 + 2} ... s_n) is a (c+1)-good string; 
  * The length of s is greater than 1, the second half of the string consists of only the character c (i.e. s_{n/2 + 1}=s_{n/2 + 2}=...=s_n=c) and the first half of the string (i.e. the string s_1s_2 ... s_{n/2}) is a (c+1)-good string. 



For example: "aabc" is 'a'-good, "ffgheeee" is 'e'-good.

In one move, you can choose one index i from 1 to n and replace s_i with any lowercase Latin letter (any character from 'a' to 'z').

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an 'a'-good string from s (i.e. c-good string for c= 'a'). It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Another example of an 'a'-good string is as follows. Consider the string s = "cdbbaaaa". It is an 'a'-good string, because:

  * the second half of the string ("aaaa") consists of only the character 'a'; 
  * the first half of the string ("cdbb") is 'b'-good string, because: 
    * the second half of the string ("bb") consists of only the character 'b'; 
    * the first half of the string ("cd") is 'c'-good string, because: 
      * the first half of the string ("c") consists of only the character 'c'; 
      * the second half of the string ("d") is 'd'-good string. 

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 131~072) — the length of s. It is guaranteed that n = 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0. The second line of the test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain an 'a'-good string from s (i.e. c-good string with c = 'a'). It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

    i = len(s) / 2
    s1 = s[:i]
    s2 = s[i:]
    stringOrd1 = chr(ord(string) + 1)
    first = func_1(s1, stringOrd1)
    count = 0
    for i in s2:

    count = 0
    for i in s1:
        if i == string:

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
