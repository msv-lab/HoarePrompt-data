Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where the second half of the string should be checked against the next character ('a' for the first call). Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly increment the character 'a' to 'b' when checking the second half of the string. Instead, it uses a string `'a'` which will not correctly evaluate the condition for the second half of the string.

For example, consider the string `"bbdcaaaa"`. According to the problem description, this string is 'a'-good because the second half ("aaaa") consists of only the character 'a'. However, the program incorrectly treats the entire string as needing to match 'a', leading to an incorrect count of moves required. 

To fix this, the character should be incremented using `chr(ord(string) + 1)` as done in the first part of the function, ensuring that the correct character is used for the second half of the string check.
