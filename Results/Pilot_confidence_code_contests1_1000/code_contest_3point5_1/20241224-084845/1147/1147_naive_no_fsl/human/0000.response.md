Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has some issues that make it incorrect for certain cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the general case correctly. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

For \( N = 4 \) and \( x = 4 \):

According to the problem description, we need to construct a permutation of \( (1, 2, \ldots, 7) \) such that the conditions are met. However, the program does not correctly generate such a permutation in all cases. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program checks for the edge case \( N = 2 \) and \( x = 2 \) and prints the correct output. However, it does not generalize this approach for other values of \( N \).

2. **General Case Logic**: The program attempts to place elements in the middle and surrounding positions but does not ensure that the median condition is satisfied throughout the entire structure. This is particularly problematic when the value \( x \) is not centered or when the structure of the pyramid does not allow a simple placement of numbers around \( x \).

3. **Example Failure**: Consider \( N = 4 \) and \( x = 4 \). The correct permutation should be able to satisfy the median condition for all blocks. However, the program's logic for placing numbers around \( x \) does not guarantee that the median condition is always satisfied, especially when \( x \) is not at the center or boundary of the pyramid.

Given these points, the program fails to construct a valid permutation in many cases, making it incorrect. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
