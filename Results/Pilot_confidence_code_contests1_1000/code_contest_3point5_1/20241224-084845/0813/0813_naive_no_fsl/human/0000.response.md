Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate the lexicographically smallest sequence as required. The issue lies in the way the program handles the graph traversal. Specifically, the program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to visit nodes but does not ensure that the nodes are visited in the lexicographically smallest order. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3
```

However, the current implementation might produce:
```
1 3 2
```

This happens because the program pushes both neighbors of the current node onto the heap without considering the lexicographical order. To fix this, we need to ensure that nodes are pushed into the heap in a sorted manner. Here is a modified version of the function that should handle this correctly:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    (n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(m):
        el = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        d[el[0]].append(el[1])
        d[el[1]].append(el[0])
    
    vis = []
    q = [(1, 1)]  # Use a tuple (node, index) to maintain order
    vis_set = set()
    while q:
        (m, _) = heapq.heappop(q)
        if m not in vis_set:
            vis.append(m)
            vis_set.add(m)
            for x in sorted(d[m]):
                if x not in vis_set:
                    heapq.heappush(q, (x, len(vis)))
    
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vis]))

func()
```

This modified version ensures that nodes are pushed into the heap in a sorted manner, thereby maintaining the lexicographical order.
