Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the radius \( R \) of the outer circles based on the given number of outer circles \( n \) and the radius of the inner circle \( r \). The formula used in the program is derived from the geometric properties of the circles, specifically the distance between the centers of the circles and the tangency conditions.

Given the input format and the mathematical derivation, the program should handle all valid inputs within the specified range (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100, 1 ≤ \( r \) ≤ 100). The formula used is:
\[ x = \sqrt{2 - 2 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)} \]
\[ R = \frac{r \cdot x}{2 - x} \]

This formula ensures that the inner circle touches all outer circles externally and that each pair of neighboring outer circles also touch each other. The program correctly applies this formula and handles the input and output as required.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and the provided test cases work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
