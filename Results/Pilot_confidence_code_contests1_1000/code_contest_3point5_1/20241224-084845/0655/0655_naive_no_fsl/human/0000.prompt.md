You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: NN is an experienced internet user and that means he spends a lot of time on the social media. Once he found the following image on the Net, which asked him to compare the sizes of inner circles:

<image>

It turned out that the circles are equal. NN was very surprised by this fact, so he decided to create a similar picture himself.

He managed to calculate the number of outer circles n and the radius of the inner circle r. NN thinks that, using this information, you can exactly determine the radius of the outer circles R so that the inner circle touches all of the outer ones externally and each pair of neighboring outer circles also touches each other. While NN tried very hard to guess the required radius, he didn't manage to do that. 

Help NN find the required radius for building the required picture.

Input

The first and the only line of the input file contains two numbers n and r (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ r ≤ 100) — the number of the outer circles and the radius of the inner circle respectively.

Output

Output a single number R — the radius of the outer circle required for building the required picture. 

Your answer will be accepted if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10^{-6}.

Formally, if your answer is a and the jury's answer is b. Your answer is accepted if and only when (|a-b|)/(max(1, |b|)) ≤ 10^{-6}.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
