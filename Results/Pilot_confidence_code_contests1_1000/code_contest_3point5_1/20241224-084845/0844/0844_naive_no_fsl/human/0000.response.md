Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not complete the task as described. Specifically, the program starts by reading the input but does not continue to count the maximum number of operations that Snuke can perform. Instead, it converts each integer into its binary representation and splits it into a list of characters. This step is not necessary to solve the problem, and the program does not proceed to count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of each number, which would determine the maximum number of operations.

To fix this, the program needs to:
1. Read the input values.
2. For each value, count the number of trailing zeros in its binary representation.
3. Find the minimum count of trailing zeros among all numbers, as this will determine the maximum number of operations Snuke can perform.

Here's an example of how the program should be completed:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    dat = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_zeros = float('inf')
    
    for e in dat:
        # Count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of e
        count = 0
        while e % 2 == 0:
            e //= 2
            count += 1
        min_zeros = min(min_zeros, count)
    
    print(min_zeros)

func()
```

This corrected version will properly count the number of operations Snuke can perform based on the problem description.
