You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given is a rooted tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N. The root is Vertex 1, and the i-th edge (1 \leq i \leq N - 1) connects Vertex a_i and b_i.

Each of the vertices has a counter installed. Initially, the counters on all the vertices have the value 0.

Now, the following Q operations will be performed:

* Operation j (1 \leq j \leq Q): Increment by x_j the counter on every vertex contained in the subtree rooted at Vertex p_j.



Find the value of the counter on each vertex after all operations.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq a_i < b_i \leq N
* 1 \leq p_j \leq N
* 1 \leq x_j \leq 10^4
* The given graph is a tree.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N Q
a_1 b_1
:
a_{N-1} b_{N-1}
p_1 x_1
:
p_Q x_Q


Output

Print the values of the counters on Vertex 1, 2, \ldots, N after all operations, in this order, with spaces in between.

    x = operation[i][1]
    for y in vertex_list[p]:
        if y != -1:
            values[y - 1] += x
mapped_values = map(str, values)
result = ''
for i in range(n):
    result += mapped_values[i]
    if i < n - 1:
        result += ' '
print(result)

def func_1(graphx, vertex, check, root):
    check[vertex - 1] = True
    vertex_list[root].add(vertex)
    for v in graph[vertex]:
        if check[v - 1] == True:
            continue
        func_1(graphx, v, check, root)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
