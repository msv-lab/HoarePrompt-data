Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function is designed to mark nodes as visited and add them to the set of nodes under the root node, but it does not correctly handle the case where a node is revisited during the traversal. This leads to incorrect results for the counter values.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 10
1 100
3 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
100 110 111 110
```

However, due to the issue in the `func_1` function, the program might not correctly update the counter values for all nodes. The function `func_1` is supposed to mark nodes as visited and add them to the set of nodes under the root node, but it does not properly handle the recursive calls and the marking of nodes.

To fix this, the function should ensure that nodes are only added to the set once and should correctly propagate the updates to the counters. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(graphx, vertex, check, root):
    check[vertex - 1] = True
    vertex_list[root].add(vertex)
    for v in graph[vertex]:
        if check[v - 1] == False:
            func_1(graphx, v, check, root)
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all inputs.
