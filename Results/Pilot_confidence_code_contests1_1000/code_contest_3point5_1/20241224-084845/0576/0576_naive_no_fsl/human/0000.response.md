Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly satisfy the problem description for certain cases. Specifically, the program always prints `1` as one of the integers and `x-1` as the other integer. This approach fails when `x` is a prime number greater than 2. For example, if `x = 3`, the program would output `1 2`, but the GCD of 1 and 2 is 1 and the LCM is 2, which sums to 3. However, this is not the only valid pair; another valid pair is `(1, 2)` which also satisfies the condition. The program does not generate such pairs for non-prime numbers either. 

A correct solution would consider different pairs of integers that satisfy the equation GCD(a, b) + LCM(a, b) = x. For instance, when `x = 4`, the program outputs `1 3`, but a valid pair would be `(2, 2)` since GCD(2, 2) + LCM(2, 2) = 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
