Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] because all positions are blocked. In such a case, the program should output -1, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. For example, if `n = 5` and all positions are blocked (`block = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`), the program will not handle this correctly and may produce an incorrect result or crash.
