You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The GCD table G of size n × n for an array of positive integers a of length n is defined by formula 

<image>

Let us remind you that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers x and y is the greatest integer that is divisor of both x and y, it is denoted as <image>. For example, for array a = {4, 3, 6, 2} of length 4 the GCD table will look as follows:

<image>

Given all the numbers of the GCD table G, restore array a.

Input

The first line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the length of array a. The second line contains n2 space-separated numbers — the elements of the GCD table of G for array a. 

All the numbers in the table are positive integers, not exceeding 109. Note that the elements are given in an arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that the set of the input data corresponds to some array a.

Output

In the single line print n positive integers — the elements of array a. If there are multiple possible solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

2 1 2 3 4 3 2 6 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 2


Output

4 3 6 2

Output

1 1 
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
seq = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
seq.sort(reverse=True)
elems = [seq[0]]
gcds = {}
for elem in seq:
    gcds[elem] = 0
i = 1
j = 1
while i < n:
    if gcds[seq[j]] != 0:
        gcds[seq[j]] -= 1
        j += 2
    else:
        l = len(elems)
        for k in xrange(l):
            gcds[func_1(elems[k], seq[j])] += 1
        elems.append(seq[j])
        j += 1
        i += 1
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in elems]))

def func_1(x, y):
    while y > 0:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
