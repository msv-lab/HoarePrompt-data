You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a string s of length n consisting of only characters > and <. You may do some operations with this string, for each operation you have to choose some character that still remains in the string. If you choose a character >, the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character <, the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).

For example, if we choose character > in string > > < >, the string will become to > > >. And if we choose character < in string > <, the string will become to <.

The string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings >, > > are good. 

Before applying the operations, you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to n - 1, but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string s so that it becomes good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) – the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two lines.

The first line of i-th test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) – the length of string s.

The second line of i-th test case contains string s, consisting of only characters > and <.

Output

For each test case print one line.

For i-th test case print the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string s so that it becomes good.

Example

Input


3
2
&lt;&gt;
3
&gt;&lt;&lt;
1
&gt;


Output


1
0
0

Note

In the first test case we can delete any character in string <>.

In the second test case we don't need to delete any characters. The string > < < is good, because we can perform the following sequence of operations: > < < → < < → <.
Program:
```
import sys

INF = 10 ** 9 + 7
T = func_1()
for t in range(T):
    n = func_1()
    s = raw_input()
    if '<>' in s:
        func_4(1)
    else:
        func_4(0)

def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())

def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline()

def func_4(*args):
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
    sys.stdout.write('\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
