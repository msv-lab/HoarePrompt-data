Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not handle the string processing and operations as required.

Here is why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are defined, but they are not used within the main logic of the program. The program reads inputs using `func_1` and `raw_input`, which are not defined anywhere in the given code snippet.

2. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the program is supposed to determine the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string good. However, the current implementation only checks if the string contains the pattern "<>" and prints 1 if it does, and 0 otherwise. This is not sufficient to handle all cases as described.

3. **String Operations**: The problem requires specific operations based on choosing ">" or "<" characters. The provided program does not simulate these operations or calculate the minimum deletions required to make the string good.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the string `"><>"`:
- According to the problem description, the minimum number of deletions needed to make this string good is 1 (delete either the first or the third character).
- However, the current program would output 1, which is correct for this specific example.
- But consider another example: the string `"><<>"`. The correct answer here would be 2 (delete the first and the fourth character), but the program does not account for such scenarios.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
