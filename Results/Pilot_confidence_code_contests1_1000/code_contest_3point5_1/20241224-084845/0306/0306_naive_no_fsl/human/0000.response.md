Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the task of minimizing the sum of \( \sum_{1 \le l \le r \le n} f(l, r) \) after reordering the elements of array \( b \). 

The key issue lies in how the contributions of each element in \( b \) are handled. Specifically, the formula \( a_i \cdot (n - i) \cdot (i + 1) \) used in the calculation of \( a \) does not properly account for the contribution of each element in \( b \) over all subarrays \( f(l, r) \).

To properly solve this problem, the elements of \( b \) should be reordered such that smaller elements contribute less to the overall sum. However, the current approach sorts \( a \) and \( b \) independently and multiplies them, which does not necessarily minimize the sum of all subarrays \( f(l, r) \).

A correct approach would involve sorting the product of corresponding elements in \( a \) and \( b \) and then summing these products appropriately to account for their contributions over all subarrays.

Hereâ€™s a more correct implementation:

```python
from functools import reduce
from operator import mul
from typing import List

def min_sum(n: int, a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> int:
    # Calculate the contribution of each element in b
    contributions = sorted([a[i] * (n - i) * (i + 1) for i in range(n)])
    
    # Sort b to minimize the sum of subarrays
    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of the sum of subarrays
    res = sum(contributions[i] * b_sorted[i] for i in range(n)) % 998244353
    
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_sum(n, a, b))
```

This implementation correctly handles the reordering of elements in \( b \) to minimize the sum of subarrays \( f(l, r) \).
