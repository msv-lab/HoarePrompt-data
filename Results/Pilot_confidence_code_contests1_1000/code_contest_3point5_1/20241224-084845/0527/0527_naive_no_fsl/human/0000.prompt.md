You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's call an array t dominated by value v in the next situation.

At first, array t should have at least 2 elements. Now, let's calculate number of occurrences of each number num in t and define it as occ(num). Then t is dominated (by v) if (and only if) occ(v) > occ(v') for any other number v'. For example, arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], [11, 11] and [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] are dominated (by 2, 11 and 3 respectevitely) but arrays [3], [1, 2] and [3, 3, 2, 2, 1] are not.

Small remark: since any array can be dominated only by one number, we can not specify this number and just say that array is either dominated or not.

You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Calculate its shortest dominated subarray or say that there are no such subarrays.

The subarray of a is a contiguous part of the array a, i. e. the array a_i, a_{i + 1}, ..., a_j for some 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.

Input

The first line contains single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the corresponding values of the array a.

It's guaranteed that the total length of all arrays in one test doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print T integers — one per test case. For each test case print the only integer — the length of the shortest dominated subarray, or -1 if there are no such subarrays.

Example

Input


4
1
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
9
4 1 2 4 5 4 3 2 1
4
3 3 3 3


Output


-1
6
3
2

Note

In the first test case, there are no subarrays of length at least 2, so the answer is -1.

In the second test case, the whole array is dominated (by 1) and it's the only dominated subarray.

In the third test case, the subarray a_4, a_5, a_6 is the shortest dominated subarray.

In the fourth test case, all subarrays of length more than one are dominated.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import Counter

out = []
for i in range(int(stdin.readline())):
    (n, a) = (int(stdin.readline()), list(map(int, stdin.readline().split())))
    out.append(str(-1) if n == 1 else func_1())
print('\n'.join(out))

def func_1():
    (be, en, ans, cur, most) = (-1, -1, float('inf'), 0, Counter(a).most_common(1)[0][0])
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == most:
            if be == -1:
                be = i
            else:
                ans = min(ans, i - be + 1)
                be = i
    return str(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
