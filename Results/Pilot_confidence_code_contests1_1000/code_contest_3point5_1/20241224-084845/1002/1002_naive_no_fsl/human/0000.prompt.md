You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.

But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.

For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion. 

You have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2n digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string that consists of 2n digits and defines your ticket.

Output

In the first line print "YES" if the ticket meets the unluckiness criterion. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

2
2421


Output

YES


Input

2
0135


Output

YES


Input

2
3754


Output

NO
Program:
```
import sys
import traceback

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split())[0]
    s = map(int, list(sys.stdin.readline()[:2 * n]))
    sb = s[:n]
    se = s[n:]
    sb.sort()
    se.sort()
    lucky = 0
    unlucky = 0
    while sb:
        b = sb.pop()
        e = se.pop()
        if b > e:
            lucky += 1
        elif b < e:
            unlucky += 1
    if lucky == n or unlucky == n:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
