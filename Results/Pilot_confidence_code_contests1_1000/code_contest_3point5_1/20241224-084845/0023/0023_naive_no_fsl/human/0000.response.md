Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a tree can be cut down and then another tree can be cut down without overlapping. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of cutting down consecutive trees without overlap when the next tree can be cut down to the right of the previous tree's fall.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 2
2 1
3 1
4 1
5 1
```

According to the problem description, we should be able to cut down 4 trees:
1. Cut down the 1st tree to the left, occupying [-1, 1].
2. Cut down the 2nd tree to the right, occupying [2, 3].
3. Cut down the 3rd tree to the right, occupying [3, 4].
4. Cut down the 4th tree to the right, occupying [4, 5].

However, the provided program only cuts down 3 trees:
1. Cut down the 1st tree to the left, occupying [-1, 1].
2. Cut down the 2nd tree to the right, occupying [2, 3].
3. Leave the 3rd tree, which occupies point 3.

The 4th and 5th trees are not cut down because the program incorrectly assumes that the segment [4, 5] is not available due to the previous tree occupying point 3.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect.
