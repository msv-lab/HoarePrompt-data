Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not guarantee that all elements \( p_i \neq i \) after the minimum number of operations. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 4 3 5 2
```

According to the problem description, we need to ensure that no element \( p_i \) is equal to \( i \). However, the current implementation may not always achieve this. For instance, in the given example, the initial permutation is `1 4 3 5 2`. The program will swap `1` and `4`, resulting in `4 1 3 5 2`, but it still has `4` in position 1. 

A better approach would be to count the number of fixed points (elements where \( p_i = i \)) and subtract this count from \( N-1 \) (since each swap can fix at most one pair). This is because each swap can reduce the number of fixed points by at most 1.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1(sys.argv)

def func_1(argv):
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    N = int(line)
    P = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')))
    fixed_points = sum(1 for i in range(N) if P[i] == i + 1)
    print(N - 1 - fixed_points)
```

This version counts the number of fixed points directly and calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to ensure no element is in its original position.
