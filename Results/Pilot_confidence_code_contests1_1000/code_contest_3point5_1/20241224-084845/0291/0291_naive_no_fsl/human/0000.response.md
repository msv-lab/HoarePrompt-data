Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error that causes it to produce incorrect results. Specifically, the program does not properly update the `cur_sum` variable when replacing elements in the array. The current implementation only updates the counter and the sum once, but it should update the sum for each operation individually.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
1 1 1 1
3
1 2
2 1
3 5
```

Expected output:
```
8
4
4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
8
4
8
```

The issue lies in the way the sum is updated. After the first operation, the sum should remain unchanged because no actual change in the sum occurs (one `1` is replaced by another `2`). However, the program incorrectly updates the sum for subsequent operations.

To fix this, you need to recompute the sum after each operation by iterating through the updated counts in the counter. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    input = input  # Use Python 3 input function
    n = int(input())
    As = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = Counter(As)
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        num1 = counter[b]
        counter[c] += num1
        counter[b] = 0  # Remove b from the counter
        cur_sum = sum(counter.elements())  # Recompute the sum after each operation
        print(cur_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum is recomputed after each operation, thus providing the correct result for each step.
