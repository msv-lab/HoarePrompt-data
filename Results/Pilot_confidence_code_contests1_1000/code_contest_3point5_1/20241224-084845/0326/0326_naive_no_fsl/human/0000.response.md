Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the target number itself is a quasibinary number. 

For example, consider the input `n = 10`. According to the problem description, the number `10` itself is a valid quasibinary number. However, the program would attempt to break down `10` into smaller quasibinary numbers and would output:

```
4
1 1 1 7
```

This is incorrect because `10` can be represented as `10`, which is a single quasibinary number. The program incorrectly breaks down `10` into four parts (`1 + 1 + 1 + 7`), instead of using just `10`.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of finding the minimum number of quasibinary numbers that sum up to the given number.
