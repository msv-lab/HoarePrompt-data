You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A number is called quasibinary if its decimal representation contains only digits 0 or 1. For example, numbers 0, 1, 101, 110011 — are quasibinary and numbers 2, 12, 900 are not.

You are given a positive integer n. Represent it as a sum of minimum number of quasibinary numbers.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106).

Output

In the first line print a single integer k — the minimum number of numbers in the representation of number n as a sum of quasibinary numbers.

In the second line print k numbers — the elements of the sum. All these numbers should be quasibinary according to the definition above, their sum should equal n. Do not have to print the leading zeroes in the numbers. The order of numbers doesn't matter. If there are multiple possible representations, you are allowed to print any of them.

Program:

import sys
import math

def func():
    f = sys.stdin
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        f = open(sys.argv[1], 'rt')
    target = int(f.readline().strip())
    target_str = str(target)
    nums = []
    X = target
    num_bin = 2 ** len(target_str) - 1
    num = int(str.format('{:b}', num_bin))
    while num_bin > 0:
        while num <= X:
            nums.append(num)
            X -= num
        num_bin -= 1
        num = int(str.format('{:b}', num_bin))
    print(len(nums))
    print(str.join(' ', map(str, nums)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
