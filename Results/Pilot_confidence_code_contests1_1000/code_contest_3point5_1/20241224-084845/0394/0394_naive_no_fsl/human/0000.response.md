Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the MEX condition cannot be satisfied for the given array `a`. Specifically, consider the input:

```
3
1 1 3
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
0 2 1
```

However, the provided program will produce:

```
0 1 2
```

This is incorrect because for the third element, MEX(\{0, 1, 2\}) is 3, not 1. The program does not ensure that the MEX condition is met for each prefix of the constructed array `b`. Thus, the program is incorrect.
