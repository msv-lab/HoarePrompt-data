Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to attempt to find the maximum possible number of moves between any two road squares in the maze. However, there are a few issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Depth Calculation Logic**: The depth calculation logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed. The function `func_1` attempts to find the shortest path using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach but does not properly handle the case where multiple paths exist and the goal is not found within the current path exploration. This leads to incorrect depth calculations.

2. **Graph Construction**: The graph construction in the main part of the program constructs possible moves but does not account for all possible valid moves correctly. For example, if a road square can move to another road square directly without any intermediate squares, the current implementation might miss these direct connections.

3. **Path Finding**: The path finding logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle all possible paths between two points. It returns `'found'` immediately when a path is found, but it does not explore all possible paths to ensure the maximum distance is found.

To illustrate a case where the program fails, consider the following maze:

```
3 3
...
...
...
```

In this case, the maximum possible number of moves between any two road squares is 4 (e.g., moving from (1,1) to (3,1)). However, the provided program might not correctly compute this value due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
