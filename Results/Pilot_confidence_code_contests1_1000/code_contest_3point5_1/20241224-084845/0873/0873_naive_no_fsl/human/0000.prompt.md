You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Giga Tower is the tallest and deepest building in Cyberland. There are 17 777 777 777 floors, numbered from  - 8 888 888 888 to 8 888 888 888. In particular, there is floor 0 between floor  - 1 and floor 1. Every day, thousands of tourists come to this place to enjoy the wonderful view. 

In Cyberland, it is believed that the number "8" is a lucky number (that's why Giga Tower has 8 888 888 888 floors above the ground), and, an integer is lucky, if and only if its decimal notation contains at least one digit "8". For example, 8, - 180, 808 are all lucky while 42, - 10 are not. In the Giga Tower, if you write code at a floor with lucky floor number, good luck will always be with you (Well, this round is #278, also lucky, huh?).

Tourist Henry goes to the tower to seek good luck. Now he is at the floor numbered a. He wants to find the minimum positive integer b, such that, if he walks b floors higher, he will arrive at a floor with a lucky number. 

Input

The only line of input contains an integer a ( - 109 ≤ a ≤ 109).

Output

Print the minimum b in a line.

Examples

Input

179


Output

1


Input

-1


Output

9


Input

18


Output

10

Note

For the first sample, he has to arrive at the floor numbered 180.

For the second sample, he will arrive at 8.

Note that b should be positive, so the answer for the third sample is 10, not 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(raw_input())
    x = a + 1
    while '8' not in str(x):
        x += 1
    print(x - a)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
