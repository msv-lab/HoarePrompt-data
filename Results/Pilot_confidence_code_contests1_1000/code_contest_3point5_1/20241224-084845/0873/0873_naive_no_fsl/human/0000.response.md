Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the input `a` itself is already a lucky number. According to the problem description, if the current floor number `a` is already a lucky number, the minimum `b` should be 0 because no additional floors need to be climbed. However, the provided program increments `x` starting from `a + 1`, which means it will always return at least 1 as the result, even if `a` is already a lucky number. 

For example, if `a = 8`, the program will output `1` instead of `0`. This violates the problem statement, making the program incorrect.
