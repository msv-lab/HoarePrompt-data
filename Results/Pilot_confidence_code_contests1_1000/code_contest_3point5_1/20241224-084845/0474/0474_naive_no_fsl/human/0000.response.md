Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program sorts the array in descending order and then alternates between adding the highest and lowest remaining elements to the new list. However, this approach does not necessarily minimize the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in a circular arrangement.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 1 1 3 2
```

The output of the program is:
```
3 2 1 2 1
```

The discomfort of this circle is 1, but it is not the minimum possible discomfort. The correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 2 1
```

In this correct arrangement, the discomfort is 1, which is the minimal possible value. The program fails to find this optimal arrangement, thus it is incorrect.
