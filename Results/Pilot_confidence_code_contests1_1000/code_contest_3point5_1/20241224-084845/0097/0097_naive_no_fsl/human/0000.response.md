Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly validate the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks for several conditions, but it does not handle all possible edge cases correctly. One such case is when the number of clears (`c_i`) decreases, which is explicitly stated as impossible in the problem description.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
10 10
15 15
15 14
```

In this case, the number of clears decreases from 15 to 14 between the second and third moments of time. This should result in the program printing "NO" because the number of clears cannot decrease. However, the current implementation does not detect this issue.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that at each step, the number of clears (`c_i`) is not less than the previous number of clears (`prevClr`). Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    t = INT()
    while t != 0:
        n = INT()
        zz = [LIST() for _ in range(n)]
        prevplay = 0
        prevClr = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if zz[i][0] < prevplay or zz[i][1] < prevClr or zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]:
                flag = 1
                break
            if zz[i][1] > prevClr:
                temp = zz[i][1] - prevClr
                temp1 = zz[i][0] - prevplay
                if temp > temp1:
                    flag = 1
                    break
            if zz[i][1] < prevClr:
                flag = 1
                break
            prevplay = zz[i][0]
            prevClr = zz[i][1]
        if flag == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of clears does not decrease between any two consecutive moments, thereby addressing the edge case identified.
