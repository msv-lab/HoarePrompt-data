Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for some cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the sorting and reassembly of the digits correctly to ensure the smallest possible number is generated without leading zeroes. 

For example, consider the input:
```
320
203
```

- The program sorts the digits `['3', '2', '0']` to `['0', '2', '3']`.
- It then checks for the first non-zero digit and swaps it with the first digit, resulting in `['2', '0', '3']`.
- Finally, it prints `OK` since the sorted list is not equal to the original list `['3', '2', '0']`.

However, the correct output should be `103`, not just `OK`. This shows that the program does not correctly generate the smallest possible number without leading zeroes in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
