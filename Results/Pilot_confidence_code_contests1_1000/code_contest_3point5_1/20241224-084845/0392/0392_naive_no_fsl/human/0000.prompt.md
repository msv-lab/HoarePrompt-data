You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One cold winter evening Alice and her older brother Bob was sitting at home near the fireplace and giving each other interesting problems to solve. When it was Alice's turn, she told the number n to Bob and said:

—Shuffle the digits in this number in order to obtain the smallest possible number without leading zeroes.

—No problem! — said Bob and immediately gave her an answer.

Alice said a random number, so she doesn't know whether Bob's answer is correct. Help her to find this out, because impatient brother is waiting for the verdict.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) without leading zeroes. The second lines contains one integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ 109) — Bob's answer, possibly with leading zeroes.

Output

Print OK if Bob's answer is correct and WRONG_ANSWER otherwise.

Examples

Input

3310
1033


Output

OK


Input

5


Output

WRONG_ANSWER
Program:
```
def func():
    I = raw_input
    n = I()
    m = I()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
    if n[i] != '0':
        (n[0], n[i]) = (n[i], n[0])
    print['OK', 'WRONG_ANSWER'][n != list(m)]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
