Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum energy required to put all pieces of trash in the trash bin. Specifically, the program seems to be calculating the energy consumption in a way that does not account for the correct formula described in the problem statement.

The problem requires the energy consumption to be calculated as follows:
- Traveling a distance \(d\) with \(k\) pieces of trash consumes \((k+1)^2 \cdot d\) points of energy.
- Picking up a piece of trash or putting pieces of trash in the trash bin consumes \(X\) points of energy.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. For example, it does not properly account for the energy consumed during the traversal and does not correctly handle the picking up and putting down of trash.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
Consider the input:
```
2 100
1 10
```

The correct solution should be:
- Pick up the trash at position 1: 100 points.
- Travel from 1 to 0: \(2^2 \cdot 1 = 4\) points.
- Put the trash in the bin: 100 points.
Total energy: \(100 + 4 + 100 = 204\).

However, the provided program outputs:
```
355
```

This indicates that the program is incorrectly calculating the energy consumption, leading to a higher value than the actual minimum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
