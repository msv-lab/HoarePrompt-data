You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke has decided to use a robot to clean his room.

There are N pieces of trash on a number line. The i-th piece from the left is at position x_i. We would like to put all of them in a trash bin at position 0.

For the positions of the pieces of trash, 0 < x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{N} \leq 10^{9} holds.

The robot is initially at position 0. It can freely move left and right along the number line, pick up a piece of trash when it comes to the position of that piece, carry any number of pieces of trash and put them in the trash bin when it comes to position 0. It is not allowed to put pieces of trash anywhere except in the trash bin.

The robot consumes X points of energy when the robot picks up a piece of trash, or put pieces of trash in the trash bin. (Putting any number of pieces of trash in the trash bin consumes X points of energy.) Also, the robot consumes (k+1)^{2} points of energy to travel by a distance of 1 when the robot is carrying k pieces of trash.

Find the minimum amount of energy required to put all the N pieces of trash in the trash bin.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5}
* 0 < x_1 < ... < x_N \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq X \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N X
x_1 x_2 ... x_{N}


Output

Print the answer.

Program:
```
def func():
    (N, X) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    x = map(int, raw_input().split())
    size = len(x)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(size - 1):
        sum = sum + (x[size - 1 - i] - x[size - 2 - i]) * (i + 2) * (i + 2) + X
    sum = sum + x[size - 1] + x[0] * (N + 1) * (N + 1) + X * 2
    sum1 = 0
    for i in range(size):
        sum1 = sum1 + x[i] * 5
    sum1 = sum1 + (N - 1) * 2 * X
    print(min(sum, sum1))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
