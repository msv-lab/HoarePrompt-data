Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic in the `while` loop does not accurately determine the number of threads that surely contain new messages. Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5
5 2 1 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

This output is correct for this specific test case. But let's consider another test case to find a discrepancy:

Input:
```
4
4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

The program incorrectly identifies that there are no threads with new messages. This is because the logic in the `while` loop does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in reverse order. In the second test case, the array `[4, 3, 2, 1]` is already in descending order, and the loop condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` fails immediately, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, making the correctness **False**.
