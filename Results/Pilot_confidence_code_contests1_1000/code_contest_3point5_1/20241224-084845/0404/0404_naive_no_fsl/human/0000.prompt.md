You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Emuskald is addicted to Codeforces, and keeps refreshing the main page not to miss any changes in the "recent actions" list. He likes to read thread conversations where each thread consists of multiple messages.

Recent actions shows a list of n different threads ordered by the time of the latest message in the thread. When a new message is posted in a thread that thread jumps on the top of the list. No two messages of different threads are ever posted at the same time.

Emuskald has just finished reading all his opened threads and refreshes the main page for some more messages to feed his addiction. He notices that no new threads have appeared in the list and at the i-th place in the list there is a thread that was at the ai-th place before the refresh. He doesn't want to waste any time reading old messages so he wants to open only threads with new messages.

Help Emuskald find out the number of threads that surely have new messages. A thread x surely has a new message if there is no such sequence of thread updates (posting messages) that both conditions hold: 

  1. thread x is not updated (it has no new messages); 
  2. the list order 1, 2, ..., n changes to a1, a2, ..., an. 

Input

The first line of input contains an integer n, the number of threads (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains a list of n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an where ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) is the old position of the i-th thread in the new list. It is guaranteed that all of the ai are distinct.

Output

Output a single integer — the number of threads that surely contain a new message.

Examples

Input

5
5 2 1 3 4


Output

2


Input

3
1 2 3


Output

0


Input

4
4 3 2 1


Output

3

Note

In the first test case, threads 2 and 5 are placed before the thread 1, so these threads must contain new messages. Threads 1, 3 and 4 may contain no new messages, if only threads 2 and 5 have new messages.

In the second test case, there may be no new messages at all, since the thread order hasn't changed.

In the third test case, only thread 1 can contain no new messages.
Program:
```
import sys, os, re, math

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split(' ')][::-1]
    i = n - 1
    while i > 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        i -= 1
    print(n - i - 1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
