You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are a coach at your local university. There are n students under your supervision, the programming skill of the i-th student is a_i.

You have to form k teams for yet another new programming competition. As you know, the more students are involved in competition the more probable the victory of your university is! So you have to form no more than k (and at least one) non-empty teams so that the total number of students in them is maximized. But you also know that each team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in each team should differ by no more than 5. Teams are independent from one another (it means that the difference between programming skills of two students from two different teams does not matter).

It is possible that some students not be included in any team at all.

Your task is to report the maximum possible total number of students in no more than k (and at least one) non-empty balanced teams.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of students and the maximum number of teams, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is a programming skill of the i-th student.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total number of students in no more than k (and at least one) non-empty balanced teams.

    for i in range(n):
        while i + cnt_from[i] < n and a[i + cnt_from[i]] - a[i] <= 5:
            cnt_from[i] += 1
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(k + 1):
            dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j])
            if j + 1 <= k:
                dp[i + cnt_from[i]][j + 1] = max(dp[i + cnt_from[i]][j + 1], dp[i][j] + cnt_from[i])
    print(dp[n][k])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
