You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dr .: Peter, I've finally done it.
Peter: What's wrong, Dr. David? Is it a silly invention again?
Dr .: This table, this table.

Peter: What? This table is.
Dr .: Okay, just do what you say. First, write your name on a piece of paper.
Peter: Yes, "PETER POTTER".
Dr .: Then, replace each character with the "code" in this table.
Peter: Well, change "P" to "111" and "E" to "110" ... It's quite annoying.


111 110 00111 110 1000 101 111 00101 00111 00111 110 1000


became. It looks like a barcode.
Dr .: All right. Then connect all the replaced strings and separate them by 5 characters.
Peter: Yes, if you connect and separate.


11111 00011 11101 00010 11110 01010 01110 01111 10100 0


It turned out to be something like this. But what about the last "0" guy?
Dr .: Add 0 to make it 5 letters.
Peter: Well, there is only one 0 at the end, so I should add four more 0s. I was able to do it.



11111 00011 11101 00010 11110 01010 01110 01111 10100 00000


Dr .: Next, use this table.

11110 |'
11111 |?



Peter: How do you use this ... yeah! Now you're going to replace the code with a letter!
Dr .: That's right. If it is "11111", go to "?", If it is "00011", go to "D".
Peter: This is simple ... well, it became "? D-C'KOPUA". But it doesn't make sense.
Dr .: Count the number of characters.
Peter: It's 10 characters. Oh, "PETER POTTER" was 12 characters, but 2 characters are reduced.
Dr .: Yes, you can use this table to reduce the number of letters. Now do the same thing in this sentence.



PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS. A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS
PETER PIPER PICKED. IF PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS, WHERE'S
THE PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS PETER PIPER PICKED?


Peter: Gyogyo, the lines are separated, what do you do?
Dr .: Due to space limitations, there are only 3 lines, but think of it as a long line with a space instead of a newline character.
Peter: Yes, yes. There is a blank space between the lines. But it's a hassle ...
Dr .: Then why not let the program do it?


So, instead of Peter, create a program that converts the read character string into a code and outputs it.



input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is given a line of strings (consisting of the characters contained in the table). The string contains at least 1 and no more than 100 characters.

The number of datasets does not exceed 200.

output

For each data set, output the converted character string on one line.

Example

Input

PETER POTTER

        c = stream.read(5)
        while c:
            print(d2[int(c.ljust(5, '0'), 2)], end='')
            c = stream.read(5)
        print()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
