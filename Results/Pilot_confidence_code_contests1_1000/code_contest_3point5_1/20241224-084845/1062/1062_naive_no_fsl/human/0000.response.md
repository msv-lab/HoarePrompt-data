Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Encoding Phase**: The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to map characters to their corresponding binary codes and vice versa.
   - `d1` maps each character to its binary code.
   - `d2` maps each binary code back to the corresponding character, including special characters like space, comma, period, dash, apostrophe, and question mark.

2. **Processing Input**: The program reads input from standard input, processes each line, and encodes the characters using the mapping in `d1`.

3. **Formatting Output**: After encoding, the program groups the binary codes into chunks of 5 characters and converts these chunks into characters using `d2`. Any trailing zeros are added to ensure each chunk is exactly 5 characters long.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all the specified cases. For instance, the input "PETER POTTER" is correctly encoded and decoded as "?D-C'KOPUA".

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description and examples provided, the correctness is **True**.
