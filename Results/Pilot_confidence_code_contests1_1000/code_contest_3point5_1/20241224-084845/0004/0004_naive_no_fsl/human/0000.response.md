Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given problem description. Specifically, the function `func_8` does not correctly calculate the value of `p_i` for each index `i`.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Function `func_8` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_8` is supposed to find the smallest integer `p_i` such that the sum of all smaller elements before `p_i` matches `s_i`.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_8` does not ensure that the chosen `p_i` is the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition. It uses a bit manipulation approach to find a value, but it does not guarantee that the chosen value is the correct one that fits the permutation criteria.

2. **Potential Case where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     0 1 1 1 10
     ```
   - The expected output is `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`. Let's see how the program processes this:
     - For `i = 4`, `s_4 = 1`. The function `func_8` should return `4` because `1` is the smallest value that can satisfy the condition with the current values. However, the current implementation might return a different value due to the way it uses bit manipulation, leading to an incorrect permutation.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the chosen `p_i` is the smallest possible value that fits the condition. This can be achieved by iterating through the possible values from 1 to `n` and checking if they satisfy the condition without affecting the previously chosen values.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_8`:

```python
def func_8(x):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if x >= i and (x - i) == func_6(i - 1):
            return i
    return -1
```

This corrected function iterates through the possible values from 1 to `n` and checks if the chosen value `i` satisfies the condition `s_i = sum of all smaller elements before i`. This ensures that the permutation is correctly restored.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to restore the permutation, the correctness is **False**.
