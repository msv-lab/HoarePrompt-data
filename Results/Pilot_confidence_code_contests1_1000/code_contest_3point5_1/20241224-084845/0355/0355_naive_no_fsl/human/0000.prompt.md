You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a deck of n cards numbered from 1 to n (not necessarily in this order in the deck). You have to sort the deck by repeating the following operation. 

  * Choose 2 ≤ k ≤ n and split the deck in k nonempty contiguous parts D_1, D_2,..., D_k (D_1 contains the first |D_1| cards of the deck, D_2 contains the following |D_2| cards and so on). Then reverse the order of the parts, transforming the deck into D_k, D_{k-1}, ..., D_2, D_1 (so, the first |D_k| cards of the new deck are D_k, the following |D_{k-1}| cards are D_{k-1} and so on). The internal order of each packet of cards D_i is unchanged by the operation. 



You have to obtain a sorted deck (i.e., a deck where the first card is 1, the second is 2 and so on) performing at most n operations. It can be proven that it is always possible to sort the deck performing at most n operations.

Examples of operation: The following are three examples of valid operations (on three decks with different sizes). 

  * If the deck is [3 6 2 1 4 5 7] (so 3 is the first card and 7 is the last card), we may apply the operation with k=4 and D_1=[3 6], D_2=[2 1 4], D_3=[5], D_4=[7]. Doing so, the deck becomes [7 5 2 1 4 3 6]. 
  * If the deck is [3 1 2], we may apply the operation with k=3 and D_1=[3], D_2=[1], D_3=[2]. Doing so, the deck becomes [2 1 3]. 
  * If the deck is [5 1 2 4 3 6], we may apply the operation with k=2 and D_1=[5 1], D_2=[2 4 3 6]. Doing so, the deck becomes [2 4 3 6 5 1]. 

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤ n≤ 52) — the number of cards in the deck.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n — the cards in the deck. The first card is c_1, the second is c_2 and so on.

It is guaranteed that for all i=1,...,n there is exactly one j∈\{1,...,n\} such that c_j = i.

Output

On the first line, print the number q of operations you perform (it must hold 0≤ q≤ n).

Then, print q lines, each describing one operation.

To describe an operation, print on a single line the number k of parts you are going to split the deck in, followed by the size of the k parts: |D_1|, |D_2|, ... , |D_k|. 

It must hold 2≤ k≤ n, and |D_i|≥ 1 for all i=1,...,k, and |D_1|+|D_2|+⋅⋅⋅ + |D_k| = n.

It can be proven that it is always possible to sort the deck performing at most n operations. If there are several ways to sort the deck you can output any of them.

Output


0

Note

Explanation of the first testcase: Initially the deck is [3 1 2 4]. 

  * The first operation splits the deck as [(3) (1 2) (4)] and then transforms it into [4 1 2 3]. 
  * The second operation splits the deck as [(4) (1 2 3)] and then transforms it into [1 2 3 4]. 

Explanation of the second testcase: Initially the deck is [6 5 4 3 2 1]. 

  * The first (and only) operation splits the deck as [(6) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1)] and then transforms it into [1 2 3 4 5 6]. 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    i = 1
    sq = False
    while i <= n:
        if i == n:
            sq = True
        i = i * 3
    if sq:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
