Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem requires sorting a deck of cards using specific operations involving splitting and reversing parts of the deck. However, the given program simply checks if `i` (which starts from 1 and multiplies by 3 in each iteration) reaches `n` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether it does. This has nothing to do with sorting the deck as described in the problem statement. Therefore, this program will not work for any input related to the given problem and is thus incorrect.
