Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `S'` has multiple consecutive `?` characters within the range where `T` can be a substring. Specifically, the program replaces the `?` characters with 'a' without considering the lexicographical smallest string requirement. For example, consider the input:

```
??p??d??
abc
```

The program should output `abcpabcd`, but it incorrectly outputs `UNRESTORABLE`. This is because the program replaces all `?` characters with 'a' without checking if a smaller lexicographical string can be formed by replacing some `?` characters with different letters.
