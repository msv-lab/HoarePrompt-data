Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is insufficient to avoid students becoming close friends. Specifically, if `k < n`, it's impossible to arrange the students such that no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. However, the current implementation does not check this condition and always tries to generate an arrangement, leading to incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2 2
```

The program should output:
```
1 1 2 
1 2 1 
```

But if we consider another input where `k < n`:
```
3 2 1
```

In this case, it should output `-1` because it's impossible to arrange the students such that no two students are in the same bus for all `d` days. However, the current program does not handle this case correctly and will try to generate an arrangement, which is invalid.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of `func_2()` to see if `k < n`. If `k < n`, print `-1` and return early. Otherwise, proceed with the arrangement logic.
