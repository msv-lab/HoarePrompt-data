Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Numbers**: The program incorrectly handles negative numbers. Specifically, the condition `if x > 0 and y < 0 and (abs(x) < abs(y)):` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For instance, consider the input `(-1, -2, 3)`. The program will attempt to increment the smaller value (which is -2) until it becomes positive, but this will never happen since both values are negative and their sum will also remain negative.

2. **Division Operation**: The line `(res += -y / x)` uses division which can lead to incorrect results for large values due to precision issues. This operation should be handled carefully to ensure correctness.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is correctly checking if either of the numbers is greater than or equal to `m`, but the main logic in the loop does not always guarantee that the pair will become m-perfect.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `(-1, -2, 3)`:
- Initial state: (-1, -2)
- First operation: (1, -2)  (since -1 + (-2) = -1, and -2 + (-1) = -3, choose -2 + 1 = 1)
- Second operation: (1, 2)  (since 1 + (-2) = -1, and -2 + 1 = -1, choose -2 + 1 = 1)
- Now the pair is (1, 2), both numbers are greater than or equal to 3, so it seems correct, but this is not guaranteed for all cases.

Given these issues, the program does not always produce the correct result for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
