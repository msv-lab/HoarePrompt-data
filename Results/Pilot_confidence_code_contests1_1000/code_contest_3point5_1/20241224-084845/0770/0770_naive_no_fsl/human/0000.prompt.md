You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has prepared n competitive programming problems. The topic of the i-th problem is a_i, and some problems' topics may coincide.

Polycarp has to host several thematic contests. All problems in each contest should have the same topic, and all contests should have pairwise distinct topics. He may not use all the problems. It is possible that there are no contests for some topics.

Polycarp wants to host competitions on consecutive days, one contest per day. Polycarp wants to host a set of contests in such a way that:

  * number of problems in each contest is exactly twice as much as in the previous contest (one day ago), the first contest can contain arbitrary number of problems; 
  * the total number of problems in all the contests should be maximized. 



Your task is to calculate the maximum number of problems in the set of thematic contests. Note, that you should not maximize the number of contests.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of problems Polycarp has prepared.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where a_i is the topic of the i-th problem.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum number of problems in the set of thematic contests.

Examples

Input

2 1 2 10 2 10 10 2 2 1 10 10 10 10 1 1 10 10


Output


14


Input


10
6 6 6 3 6 1000000000 3 3 6 6


Output


9


Input


3
1337 1337 1337


Output


3

Note

In the first example the optimal sequence of contests is: 2 problems of the topic 1, 4 problems of the topic 2, 8 problems of the topic 10.

In the second example the optimal sequence of contests is: 3 problems of the topic 3, 6 problems of the topic 6.

In the third example you can take all the problems with the topic 1337 (the number of such problems is 3 so the answer is 3) and host a single contest.
Program:
```
import sys,math
from fractions import gcd
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect
from collections import defaultdict
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for el in arr:
        d[el] += 1
    arr = []
    for k in d:
        arr.append(d[k])
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    m = arr[0]
    while arr[0] > 0:
        cur = arr[0]
        cs = arr[0]
        j = 1
        while cur % 2 == 0 and j < len(arr) and (arr[j] >= cur // 2):
            j += 1
            cur /= 2
            cs += cur
        m = max(m, cs)
        arr[0] -= 1
    print(m)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
