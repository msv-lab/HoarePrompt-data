Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually compute the number of distinct integers that can be formed by selecting k cards from n cards and arranging them. Instead, it reads the input but does not process it to produce the required output. Specifically, the program does not use permutations to generate the possible integers or count the unique ones. 

Here is a brief outline of what the program should do:
1. Read the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to select `k`.
2. Read the integers on the cards.
3. Generate all possible combinations of `k` cards from `n` cards.
4. For each combination, generate all possible permutations (arrangements) of the selected cards.
5. Convert each permutation to an integer.
6. Count the number of unique integers generated.

Since the provided program does not implement any of these steps, it will not produce the correct output for any input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
