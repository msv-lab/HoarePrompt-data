You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Akaki, a patissier, can make N kinds of doughnut using only a certain powder called "Okashi no Moto" (literally "material of pastry", simply called Moto below) as ingredient. These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.

Now, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:

* For each of the N kinds of doughnuts, make at least one doughnut of that kind.



At most how many doughnuts can be made here? She does not necessarily need to consume all of her Moto. Also, under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to obey the condition.

Constraints

* 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 1000
* m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_N ≤ X ≤ 10^5
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N X
m_1
m_2
:
m_N


Output

Print the maximum number of doughnuts that can be made under the condition.

    N = S[0]
    X = S[1]
    m = []
    for i in range(N):
        m.append(int(raw_input()))
    X -= sum(m)
    print(len(m) + X // sorted(m)[0])

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
