Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the sum of `m_i` values is greater than `X`. Specifically, the program subtracts the sum of `m_i` from `X` before sorting and dividing, which is incorrect because the initial `X` value should be used to determine how many additional doughnuts can be made after ensuring each type of doughnut is made at least once.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:
```
3 300
150
150
150
```

According to the problem description, Akaki needs to make at least one doughnut of each kind, so she must use 450 grams of Moto initially (150 grams for each of the 3 types). This leaves her with -150 grams, which is impossible. The correct approach would be to first ensure each type of doughnut is made once, then use the remaining Moto to make additional doughnuts.

The correct solution should be:
1. Ensure each type of doughnut is made at least once by subtracting the sum of `m_i` from `X`.
2. Use the remaining Moto to make additional doughnuts.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    S = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N = S[0]
    X = S[1]
    m = [int(input()) for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Ensure each type of doughnut is made at least once
    X -= sum(m)
    
    # If there's enough Moto left to make additional doughnuts
    if X > 0:
        print(len(m) + X // min(m))
    else:
        print(len(m))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
