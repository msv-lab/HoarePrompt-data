You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation p is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and ai < aj. For example, a permutation [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

You are given a permutation a of size n and m queries to it. Each query is represented by two indices l and r denoting that you have to reverse the segment [l, r] of the permutation. For example, if a = [1, 2, 3, 4] and a query l = 2, r = 4 is applied, then the resulting permutation is [1, 4, 3, 2].

After each query you have to determine whether the number of inversions is odd or even.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1500) — the size of the permutation. 

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) — the elements of the permutation. These integers are pairwise distinct.

The third line contains one integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105) — the number of queries to process.

Then m lines follow, i-th line containing two integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n) denoting that i-th query is to reverse a segment [li, ri] of the permutation. All queries are performed one after another.

Output

Print m lines. i-th of them must be equal to odd if the number of inversions in the permutation after i-th query is odd, and even otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3
2
1 2
2 3


Output

odd
even


Input

4
1 2 4 3
4
1 1
1 4
1 4
2 3


Output

odd
odd
odd
even

Note

The first example:

  1. after the first query a = [2, 1, 3], inversion: (2, 1); 
  2. after the second query a = [2, 3, 1], inversions: (3, 1), (3, 2). 



The second example:

  1. a = [1, 2, 4, 3], inversion: (4, 3); 
  2. a = [3, 4, 2, 1], inversions: (3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3); 
  3. a = [1, 2, 4, 3], inversion: (4, 3); 
  4. a = [1, 4, 2, 3], inversions: (3, 2), (4, 2). 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from itertools import repeat

func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    a = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    m = int(stdin.readline())
    q = map(int, stdin.read().split(), repeat(10, 2 * m))
    q[1] = (q[1] - q[0]) / 2
    for i in xrange(1, m):
        q[i * 2 + 1] = (q[i * 2 + 1] - q[i * 2]) / 2 + q[i * 2 - 2]
    ans = [('odd', 'even')[q[i * 2 + 1] % 2] for i in xrange(m)]
    stdout.write('\n'.join(ans))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
