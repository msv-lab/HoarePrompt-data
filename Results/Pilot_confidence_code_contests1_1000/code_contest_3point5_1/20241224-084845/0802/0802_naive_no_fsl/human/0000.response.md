Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Reading of Queries**: The program reads the queries using `stdin.read().split()`, which is not the correct way to read pairs of integers for the queries. Instead, it should read the queries using a loop to parse pairs of integers.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Query Indices**: The program attempts to calculate query indices but does not properly handle the reversal of segments in the permutation. It does not actually perform the segment reversals on the permutation list.

3. **Inversion Counting**: The program does not count the inversions after each query. Instead, it tries to determine the parity of inversions without updating the permutation correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_inversions(a):
    n = len(a)
    inversions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                inversions += 1
    return inversions % 2

def reverse_segment(a, l, r):
    while l < r:
        a[l], a[r] = a[r], a[l]
        l += 1
        r -= 1

def process_queries(a, queries):
    n = len(a)
    for l, r in queries:
        reverse_segment(a, l-1, r-1)
    return count_inversions(a)

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    
    for i in range(m):
        inversions = process_queries(a.copy(), queries[:i+1])
        if inversions == 0:
            print('even')
        else:
            print('odd')

main()
```

This corrected program properly handles the reading of inputs, performs the segment reversals, and counts the inversions correctly after each query.
