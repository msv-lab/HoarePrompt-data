Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the cells of the strip, following the directions and lengths specified until the grasshopper either jumps out of the strip or encounters a cell where it has already jumped, indicating an infinite loop.

- The program initializes the position `pos` to 0.
- It uses a `while` loop to keep jumping until the grasshopper either jumps out of bounds or encounters a cell where it has already jumped (i.e., `power[pos]` is 0).
- The jump direction is determined by the character in the `field` string, with a simple arithmetic operation to move left or right.
- If the grasshopper's new position is within bounds (`0 <= pos < n`), the cell's jump count is reset to 0 to indicate it has been visited.
- If the grasshopper eventually jumps out of bounds, it prints "FINITE".
- If the grasshopper enters a cycle (revisits a cell with non-zero jump count), it prints "INFINITE".

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
