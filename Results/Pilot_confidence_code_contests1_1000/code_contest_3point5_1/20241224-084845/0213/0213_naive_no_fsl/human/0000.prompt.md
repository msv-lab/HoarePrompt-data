You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has recently got a job as a cashier at a local store. His day at work is L minutes long. Vasya has already memorized n regular customers, the i-th of which comes after t_{i} minutes after the beginning of the day, and his service consumes l_{i} minutes. It is guaranteed that no customer will arrive while Vasya is servicing another customer. 

Vasya is a bit lazy, so he likes taking smoke breaks for a minutes each. Those breaks may go one after another, but Vasya must be present at work during all the time periods he must serve regular customers, otherwise one of them may alert his boss. What is the maximum number of breaks Vasya can take during the day?

Input

The first line contains three integers n, L and a (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^{9}, 1 ≤ a ≤ L).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers t_{i} and l_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ L - 1, 1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ L). It is guaranteed that t_{i} + l_{i} ≤ t_{i + 1} and t_{n} + l_{n} ≤ L.

Output

Output one integer — the maximum number of breaks.

Examples

Input

2 11 3
0 1
1 1


Output

3

Input

0 5 2


Output

2

Input

1 3 2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first sample Vasya can take 3 breaks starting after 2, 5 and 8 minutes after the beginning of the day.

In the second sample Vasya can take 2 breaks starting after 0 and 2 minutes after the beginning of the day.

In the third sample Vasya can't take any breaks.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L, a) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ltime = 0
    allb = 0
    for i in range(n):
        (ti, li) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        btime = ti - ltime
        if btime > a:
            allb = allb + btime // a
        ltime = ti + li
    if L > ltime:
        btime = L - ltime
        allb = allb + btime // a
    print(allb)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
