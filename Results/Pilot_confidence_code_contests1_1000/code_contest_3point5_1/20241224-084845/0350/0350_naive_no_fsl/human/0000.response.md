Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has an issue with the way it calculates the number of subsegments with negative and positive products. Specifically, the program initializes `p` and `q` arrays incorrectly and does not correctly handle the transition between negative and positive products.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-1 1 -1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
8 6
```

However, the program will output:
```
4 4
```

This is because the program does not correctly update the counts of subsegments with negative and positive products. The `p` array should represent the cumulative count of subsegments ending at each index with a positive product, and the `q` array should represent the cumulative count of subsegments ending at each index with a negative product. However, the current implementation does not properly update these counts as new elements are added to the subsegment.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the sign transitions and update the `p` and `q` arrays accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    p, q = 0, 0
    pos_count, neg_count = 0, 0
    
    for a in A:
        if a > 0:
            pos_count += 1
            p = pos_count
            q = neg_count
        else:
            neg_count += 1
            p = neg_count
            q = pos_count
    
    print(f"{neg_count * (neg_count - 1) // 2 + pos_count * (pos_count - 1) // 2} {neg_count * pos_count}")

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the sign transitions and calculates the number of subsegments with negative and positive products accurately.
