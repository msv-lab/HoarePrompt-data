Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the calculation for `t` and the subsequent logic to handle the encryption process are incorrect. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `t`:**
   - In the original `func_1`, the variable `t` accumulates the sum of the first `k` elements of the key. This is used correctly to update the message in a sliding window fashion.
   - In `func_2`, `t` is defined but not used effectively. The variable `inckeys` and `lastkeys` are computed incorrectly and not used in the intended manner.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Key Application:**
   - The logic for updating the message in `func_2` does not correctly apply the key in a sliding window fashion as described in the problem statement. For instance, the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(n - m + 1, n):
         t = lastkeys[k] if i >= m - 1 else lastkeys[k] - lastkeys[len(lastkeys) - 1 - (m - i - 2)]
         result[i] = (result[i] + t) % c
         k += 1
     ```
     is overly complex and does not correctly reflect the sliding window mechanism.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  4 3 2
  1 1 1 1
  1 1 1
  ```

Expected output:
- Output should be `0 1 1 0`.

However, running the provided code with this input results in incorrect output due to the flawed logic in `func_2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
