Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the general case as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only considers a few simple scenarios and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid that would prevent Roger Waters from reaching the bottom-right corner `(n,n)` for any digit he chooses.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program only checks specific conditions for the first four cells, which is insufficient. It does not consider all possible paths and configurations of the grid.
2. **General Strategy**: The program attempts to invert at most two cells but does not have a robust strategy to ensure that both `0` and `1` paths are blocked. This means there are scenarios where the program fails to block both paths correctly.
3. **Inverted Cells Calculation**: The program does not dynamically calculate the necessary cells to invert based on the current configuration of the grid. Instead, it hardcodes some checks and assumes certain conditions, which is not a general solution.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following grid:
```
S000
0001
0010
010F
```
- For the digit `0`, the path `(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)` works.
- For the digit `1`, the path `(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)` also works.

The program fails to block both paths effectively in this scenario because it does not dynamically check all possible paths and invert the necessary cells to block both `0` and `1` paths.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
