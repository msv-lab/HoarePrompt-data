You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pink Floyd are pulling a prank on Roger Waters. They know he doesn't like [walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U), he wants to be able to walk freely, so they are blocking him from exiting his room which can be seen as a grid.

Roger Waters has a square grid of size n× n and he wants to traverse his grid from the upper left (1,1) corner to the lower right corner (n,n). Waters can move from a square to any other square adjacent by a side, as long as he is still in the grid. Also except for the cells (1,1) and (n,n) every cell has a value 0 or 1 in it.

Before starting his traversal he will pick either a 0 or a 1 and will be able to only go to cells values in which are equal to the digit he chose. The starting and finishing cells (1,1) and (n,n) are exempt from this rule, he may go through them regardless of picked digit. Because of this the cell (1,1) takes value the letter 'S' and the cell (n,n) takes value the letter 'F'.

For example, in the first example test case, he can go from (1, 1) to (n, n) by using the zeroes on this path: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

The rest of the band (Pink Floyd) wants Waters to not be able to do his traversal, so while he is not looking they will invert at most two cells in the grid (from 0 to 1 or vice versa). They are afraid they will not be quick enough and asked for your help in choosing the cells.  Note that you cannot invert cells (1, 1) and (n, n).

We can show that there always exists a solution for the given constraints.

Also note that Waters will pick his digit of the traversal after the band has changed his grid, so he must not be able to reach (n,n) no matter what digit he picks.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 200).

The following n lines of each test case contain the binary grid, square (1, 1) being colored in 'S' and square (n, n) being colored in 'F'.

The sum of values of n doesn't exceed 200.

Output

For each test case output on the first line an integer c (0 ≤ c ≤ 2) — the number of inverted cells.

In i-th of the following c lines, print the coordinates of the i-th cell you inverted. You may not invert the same cell twice.  Note that you cannot invert cells (1, 1) and (n, n).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
