There is data on sales of your company. Your task is to write a program which identifies good workers.

The program should read a list of data where each item includes the employee ID i, the amount of sales q and the corresponding unit price p. Then, the program should print IDs of employees whose total sales proceeds (i.e. sum of p Ã— q) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 in the order of inputting. If there is no such employees, the program should print "NA". You can suppose that n < 4000, and each employee has an unique ID. The unit price p is less than or equal to 1,000,000 and the amount of sales q is less than or equal to 100,000.



Input

The input consists of several datasets. The input ends with a line including a single 0. Each dataset consists of:


n (the number of data in the list)
i p q
i p q

i p q


Output

For each dataset, print a list of employee IDs or a text "NA"
