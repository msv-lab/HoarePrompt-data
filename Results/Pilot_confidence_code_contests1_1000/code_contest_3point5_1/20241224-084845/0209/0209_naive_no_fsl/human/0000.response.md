Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies employees whose total sales proceeds are greater than or equal to 1,000,000. It reads the number of data points `n`, processes each data point to calculate the total sales proceeds for each employee, and then prints the IDs of those employees who meet the criteria. If no such employees are found, it prints "NA".

The program handles the following aspects correctly:
- It reads the input as specified.
- It calculates the total sales proceeds for each employee using the formula `price * num`.
- It stores the employee IDs in a counter to keep track of their total sales.
- It checks if the total sales proceed is greater than or equal to 1,000,000.
- It prints the employee IDs in the order they were inputted.
- It handles the termination condition correctly by exiting when `n` is 0.

Since the program correctly implements all the requirements described in the problem statement, it is correct for all potential cases.
