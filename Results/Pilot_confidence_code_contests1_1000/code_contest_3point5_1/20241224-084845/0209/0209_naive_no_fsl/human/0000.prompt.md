You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is data on sales of your company. Your task is to write a program which identifies good workers.

The program should read a list of data where each item includes the employee ID i, the amount of sales q and the corresponding unit price p. Then, the program should print IDs of employees whose total sales proceeds (i.e. sum of p Ã— q) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 in the order of inputting. If there is no such employees, the program should print "NA". You can suppose that n < 4000, and each employee has an unique ID. The unit price p is less than or equal to 1,000,000 and the amount of sales q is less than or equal to 100,000.



Input

The input consists of several datasets. The input ends with a line including a single 0. Each dataset consists of:


n (the number of data in the list)
i p q
i p q
:
:
i p q


Output

For each dataset, print a list of employee IDs or a text "NA"

Example

Input

4
1001 2000 520
1002 1800 450
1003 1600 625
1001 200 1220
2
1001 100 3
1005 1000 100
2
2013 5000 100
2013 5000 100
0


Output

1001
1003
NA
2013
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin, exit
from collections import Counter

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1(readline=stdin.readline):
    count = Counter()
    member = []
    while 1:
        n = int(readline())
        if not n:
            exit()
        count.clear()
        del member[:]
        for _ in range(n):
            (i, price, num) = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
            count[i] += price * num
            if i not in member:
                member.append(i)
        member = [i for i in member if count[i] >= 1000000]
        if member:
            print(*member, sep='\n')
        else:
            print('NA')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
