You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is one apple tree in Arkady's garden. It can be represented as a set of junctions connected with branches so that there is only one way to reach any junctions from any other one using branches. The junctions are enumerated from 1 to n, the junction 1 is called the root.

A subtree of a junction v is a set of junctions u such that the path from u to the root must pass through v. Note that v itself is included in a subtree of v.

A leaf is such a junction that its subtree contains exactly one junction.

The New Year is coming, so Arkady wants to decorate the tree. He will put a light bulb of some color on each leaf junction and then count the number happy junctions. A happy junction is such a junction t that all light bulbs in the subtree of t have different colors.

Arkady is interested in the following question: for each k from 1 to n, what is the minimum number of different colors needed to make the number of happy junctions be greater than or equal to k?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of junctions in the tree.

The second line contains n - 1 integers p_2, p_3, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i < i), where p_i means there is a branch between junctions i and p_i. It is guaranteed that this set of branches forms a tree.

Output

Output n integers. The i-th of them should be the minimum number of colors needed to make the number of happy junctions be at least i.

Examples

Input


3
1 1


Output


1 1 2 


Input


5
1 1 3 3


Output


1 1 1 2 3 

Note

In the first example for k = 1 and k = 2 we can use only one color: the junctions 2 and 3 will be happy. For k = 3 you have to put the bulbs of different colors to make all the junctions happy.

In the second example for k = 4 you can, for example, put the bulbs of color 1 in junctions 2 and 4, and a bulb of color 2 into junction 5. The happy junctions are the ones with indices 2, 3, 4 and 5 then.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
func_5()

def func_1(type):
    return type(input())

def func_2(type):
    return list(map(type, input().split()))

def func_3():
    return list(input())

def func_4(type):
    return map(type, input().split())

def func_5():
    (n, c) = (func_1(int), func_2(int))
    g = {}
    for i in range(n):
        g[i] = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        g[c[i] - 1].append(i + 1)
    cont = [0] * n
    vis = [False] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if len(g[i]) == 0:
            cont[i] = 1
        else:
            for nxt in g[i]:
                cont[i] += cont[nxt]
    cont.sort()
    print(' '.join([str(cur) for cur in cont]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
