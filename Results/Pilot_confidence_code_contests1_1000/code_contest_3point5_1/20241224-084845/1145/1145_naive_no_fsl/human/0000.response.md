Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program reads from a file named `data.txt` instead of reading from standard input as specified in the problem description. This means that if the input is provided through standard input, the program will fail to read it correctly. Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum and maximum possible values of \(N\) is flawed. The program attempts to binary search for these values, but the way it calculates the remaining children after each round is incorrect. Specifically, the line `val = val - val % int(k)` is incorrect because it only removes complete groups and does not account for the fact that the remaining children might not form a complete group in the next round. This leads to incorrect results for many test cases.
