You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An adult game master and N children are playing a game on an ice rink. The game consists of K rounds. In the i-th round, the game master announces:

* Form groups consisting of A_i children each!



Then the children who are still in the game form as many groups of A_i children as possible. One child may belong to at most one group. Those who are left without a group leave the game. The others proceed to the next round. Note that it's possible that nobody leaves the game in some round.

In the end, after the K-th round, there are exactly two children left, and they are declared the winners.

You have heard the values of A_1, A_2, ..., A_K. You don't know N, but you want to estimate it.

Find the smallest and the largest possible number of children in the game before the start, or determine that no valid values of N exist.

Constraints

* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 2 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


K
A_1 A_2 ... A_K


Output

Print two integers representing the smallest and the largest possible value of N, respectively, or a single integer -1 if the described situation is impossible.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
