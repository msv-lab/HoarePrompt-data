You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has a strict daily schedule. He has n alarms set for each day, and the i-th alarm rings each day at the same time during exactly one minute.

Determine the longest time segment when Polycarp can sleep, i. e. no alarm rings in that period. It is possible that Polycarp begins to sleep in one day, and wakes up in another.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of alarms.

Each of the next n lines contains a description of one alarm. Each description has a format "hh:mm", where hh is the hour when the alarm rings, and mm is the minute of that hour when the alarm rings. The number of hours is between 0 and 23, and the number of minutes is between 0 and 59. All alarm times are distinct. The order of the alarms is arbitrary.

Each alarm starts ringing in the beginning of the corresponding minute and rings for exactly one minute (i. e. stops ringing in the beginning of the next minute). Polycarp can start sleeping instantly when no alarm is ringing, and he wakes up at the moment when some alarm starts ringing.

Output

Print a line in format "hh:mm", denoting the maximum time Polycarp can sleep continuously. hh denotes the number of hours, and mm denotes the number of minutes. The number of minutes should be between 0 and 59. Look through examples to understand the format better.

23:59


Input

4
22:00
03:21
16:03
09:59


Output

06:37

Note

In the first example there is only one alarm which rings during one minute of a day, and then rings again on the next day, 23 hours and 59 minutes later. Polycarp can sleep all this time.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from itertools import repeat
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    n = input()
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        k = raw_input().split(':')
        a.append(int(k[0]) * 60 + int(k[1]))
    max = 0
    a = sorted(a)
    deck = 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i + 1] - a[i] - deck > max:
            if a[i + 1] - a[i] == 1:
                deck += 1
            else:
                deck = 1
            max = a[i + 1] - a[i] - deck
    if 1440 - a[n - 1] + a[0] - deck > max:
        if 1440 - a[n - 1] + a[0] == 1:
            deck += 1
        else:
            deck = 1
        max = 1440 - a[n - 1] + a[0] - deck
    hours = int(math.ceil(max / 60))
    mins = max - hours * 60
    hours_s = str(hours)
    mins_s = str(mins)
    if hours < 10:
        hours_s = '0' + hours_s
    if mins < 10:
        mins_s = '0' + mins_s
    print(hours_s + ':' + mins_s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
