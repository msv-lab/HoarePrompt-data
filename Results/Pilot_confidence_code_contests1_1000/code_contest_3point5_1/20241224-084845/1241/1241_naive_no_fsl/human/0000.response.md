Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same but the length of the array is greater than 1. In such cases, the program incorrectly returns the indices of all elements instead of just removing one element to make the array beautiful.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
4
1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is `1` because we can remove one of the elements to make the array beautiful. However, the current implementation will output the indices `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to check if all elements in the array are the same and handle this case separately. Here is a modified version of the `func_6` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_6():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_2()
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(a)) == 1:
        return [i + 1 for i in range(n - 1)]
    
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    if n == 2:
        if a[0] == a[1]:
            return [1, 2]
        elif a[0] < a[1]:
            return [2]
        else:
            return [1]
    a = [(i, x) for (i, x) in enumerate(a)]
    a.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    pfs = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pfs[i + 1] = pfs[i] + a[i][1]
    i = n - 1
    while i > 0:
        if pfs[i] < a[i][1]:
            break
        i -= 1
    ans = [a[j][0] + 1 for j in range(i, n)]
    ans.sort()
    return ans
```

This modification ensures that the program handles the case where all elements are the same and only removes the necessary elements to make the array beautiful.
