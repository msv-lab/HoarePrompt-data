You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!

Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers "A factorial" and "B factorial". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(A!, B!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. Thus x! = 1·2·3·...·(x - 1)·x. For example 4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. Recall that GCD(x, y) is the largest positive integer q that divides (without a remainder) both x and y.

Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?

Input

The first and single line contains two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 109, min(A, B) ≤ 12).

Output

Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers A! and B!.

Example

Input

4 3


Output

6

Note

Consider the sample.

4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. 3! = 1·2·3 = 6. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and 6 is exactly 6.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    f = 1
    if a < b:
        while a > 1:
            f = f * a
            a = a - 1
        print(f)
    elif a > b:
        while b > 1:
            f = f * b
            b = b - 1
        print(f)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
