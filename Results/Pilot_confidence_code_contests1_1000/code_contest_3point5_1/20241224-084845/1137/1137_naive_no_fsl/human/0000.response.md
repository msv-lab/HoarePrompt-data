Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the factorials of two integers A and B. Instead, it calculates the factorial of the smaller of the two numbers and prints it. This is evident from the logic where it checks if `a < b` and then calculates the factorial of `a`, or vice versa.

For instance, consider the input `4 3`. According to the problem description, the program should calculate the GCD of `4!` and `3!`, which is `6`. However, the program incorrectly calculates only `3!` as `6` instead of computing the GCD of `24` (which is `4!`) and `6` (which is `3!`), leading to an incorrect output.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should compute the factorials of both `A` and `B` and then find their GCD. However, given the constraints and the provided code, the program fails to do so.
