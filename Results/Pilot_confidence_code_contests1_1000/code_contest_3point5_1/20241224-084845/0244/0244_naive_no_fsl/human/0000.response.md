Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the field dimensions are already sufficient to place the rectangle without needing any extensions. Specifically, the program does not check if the initial field dimensions are already large enough to accommodate the rectangle before attempting to use extensions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2
```
According to the problem description, if the initial field dimensions are already sufficient to place the rectangle, the program should output `0`. However, the current implementation does not perform this check and will attempt to use extensions, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the initial field dimensions are already large enough to place the rectangle. If they are, the program should immediately return `0`.
