Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not check if it is possible to divide the apples such that the total weight given to each friend is equal. Instead, it simply checks if the total sum of the weights is even. This approach is insufficient because even if the total sum is even, it does not guarantee that the apples can be divided equally.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
100 100 100 200
```

- The total weight is `100 + 100 + 100 + 200 = 500`, which is even.
- However, it is impossible to divide the apples such that both friends get the same total weight because the only way to get 250 grams for each friend would require splitting an apple, which is not allowed.

The program will incorrectly output "YES" in this case, but the correct output should be "NO".

To fix this, the program needs to check if it is possible to partition the apples into two groups with equal total weight. This can be done using dynamic programming or a backtracking approach.
