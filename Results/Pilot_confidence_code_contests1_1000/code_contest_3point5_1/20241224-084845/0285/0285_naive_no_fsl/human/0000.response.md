Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, it fails to handle situations where the total count of students with a particular academic performance across both groups is odd. This violates the problem statement, which requires that for each academic performance, the counts in both groups must be equal after the exchanges.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
3 2 5 5
4 1 4 1
```

The program output is `1`, but the correct answer should be `-1` because the total number of students with academic performance `5` is `2` (one in each group), which cannot be evenly distributed through exchanges.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the sum of counts for each academic performance across both groups is even before proceeding with the calculation. If any of these sums are odd, the function should return `-1`.
