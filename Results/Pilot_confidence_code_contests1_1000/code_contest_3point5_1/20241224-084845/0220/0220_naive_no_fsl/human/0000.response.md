Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has an issue with constructing the lexicographically smallest words such that the k-th word is minimized. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the k-th word is minimized in all cases. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 3 2
aaabbccddeeff
```

Expected Output:
```
aaab
bbbc
ccde
```

However, the provided program will produce:
```
aaab
bbbc
cccd
```

In this case, the third word `cccd` is not lexicographically smaller than `ccde`, which is the correct lexicographically smallest word for the k-th position. The program does not properly handle the placement of characters to ensure the k-th word is minimized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
