You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lucy likes letters. She studied the definition of the lexicographical order at school and plays with it.

At first, she tried to construct the lexicographically smallest word out of given letters. It was so easy! Then she tried to build multiple words and minimize one of them. This was much harder!

Formally, Lucy wants to make n words of length l each out of the given n ⋅ l letters, so that the k-th of them in the lexicographic order is lexicographically as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, l, and k (1≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1 000; 1 ≤ l ≤ 1 000) — the total number of words, the length of each word, and the index of the word Lucy wants to minimize.

The next line contains a string of n ⋅ l lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

Output

Output n words of l letters each, one per line, using the letters from the input. Words must be sorted in the lexicographic order, and the k-th of them must be lexicographically as small as possible. If there are multiple answers with the smallest k-th word, output any of them.

Examples

Input


3 2 2
abcdef


Output


af
bc
ed

Input


2 3 1
abcabc


Output


aab
bcc
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    (n, l, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    (s, out) = (sorted(stdin.readline().strip())[::-1], [[] for _ in range(n)])
    for i in range(l):
        for j in range(k):
            out[j].append(s.pop())
        if k == 1 or out[k - 1][-1] > out[k - 2][-1]:
            break
    while len(out[k - 1]) < l:
        out[k - 1].append(s.pop())
    for i in range(n):
        while len(out[i]) < l:
            out[i].append(s.pop())
    print('\n'.join([''.join(x) for x in out]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
