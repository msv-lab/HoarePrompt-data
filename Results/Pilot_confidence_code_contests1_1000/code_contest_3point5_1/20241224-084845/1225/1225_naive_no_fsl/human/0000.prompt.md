You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N holes in a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th hole are (x_i,y_i).

Let R=10^{10^{10^{10}}}. Ringo performs the following operation:

* Randomly choose a point from the interior of a circle of radius R centered at the origin, and put Snuke there. Snuke will move to the hole with the smallest Euclidean distance from the point, and fall into that hole. If there are multiple such holes, the hole with the smallest index will be chosen.



For every i (1 \leq i \leq N), find the probability that Snuke falls into the i-th hole.

Here, the operation of randomly choosing a point from the interior of a circle of radius R is defined as follows:

* Pick two real numbers x and y independently according to uniform distribution on [-R,R].
* If x^2+y^2\leq R^2, the point (x,y) is chosen. Otherwise, repeat picking the real numbers x,y until the condition is met.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* |x_i|,|y_i| \leq 10^6(1\leq i\leq N)
* All given points are pairwise distinct.
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
x_1 y_1
:
x_N y_N


Output

Print N real numbers. The i-th real number must represent the probability that Snuke falls into the i-th hole.

The output will be judged correct when, for all output values, the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-5}.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
