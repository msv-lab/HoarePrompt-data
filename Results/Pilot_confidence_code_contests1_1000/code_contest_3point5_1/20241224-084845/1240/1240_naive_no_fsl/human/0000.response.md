Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the full range of `x_i` values correctly. Specifically, the program uses a binary representation approach which may fail for very large values of `x_i` due to the limitations of the binary string representation. 

In the provided code, the line `maxK = max([len(x) for x in b])` calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of the numbers in the list `a`. However, the subsequent operations assume that the binary strings are zero-padded up to this maximum length, which is problematic for large values of `x_i` that might exceed the typical 60-bit limit used in the problem description. This assumption leads to incorrect results when dealing with inputs where the binary representation of `x_i` is close to or exceeds 60 bits.

To illustrate, consider the last test case where the numbers are extremely large:
```
5
536870912 536870911 1152921504606846975 1152921504606846974 1152921504606846973
```

For such large numbers, the binary representation will not fit into the 60-bit limit assumed in the code, leading to incorrect counting of set bits and thus producing wrong results. The program fails to handle these large values correctly due to its reliance on the binary string representation.
