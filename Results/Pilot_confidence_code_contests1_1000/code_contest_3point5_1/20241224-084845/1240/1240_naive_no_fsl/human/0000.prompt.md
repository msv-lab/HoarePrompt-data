You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Only a few know that Pan and Apollo weren't only battling for the title of the GOAT musician. A few millenniums later, they also challenged each other in math (or rather in fast calculations). The task they got to solve is the following:

Let x_1, x_2, …, x_n be the sequence of n non-negative integers. Find this value: $$$∑_{i=1}^n ∑_{j=1}^n ∑_{k=1}^n (x_i   \&   x_j) ⋅ (x_j   |   x_k)$$$

Here \& denotes the [bitwise and,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) and | denotes the [bitwise or.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR)

Pan and Apollo could solve this in a few seconds. Can you do it too? For convenience, find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1 000) denoting the number of test cases, then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), the length of the sequence. The second one contains n non-negative integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (0 ≤ x_i < 2^{60}), elements of the sequence.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print t lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th text case.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
