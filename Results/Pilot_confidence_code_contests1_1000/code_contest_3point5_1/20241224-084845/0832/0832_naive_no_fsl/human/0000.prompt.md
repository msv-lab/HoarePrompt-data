You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, and a number m.

Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequence aij such that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.

Input

The first line contains two numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 2 ≤ m ≤ 103) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output

In the single line print either "YES" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or "NO" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

3 5
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

1 6
5


Output

NO


Input

4 6
3 1 1 3


Output

YES


Input

6 6
5 5 5 5 5 5


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample test you can choose numbers 2 and 3, the sum of which is divisible by 5.

In the second sample test the single non-empty subsequence of numbers is a single number 5. Number 5 is not divisible by 6, that is, the sought subsequence doesn't exist.

In the third sample test you need to choose two numbers 3 on the ends.

In the fourth sample test you can take the whole subsequence.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
