Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to restore the original array `a` from the given array `b`. Specifically, the function `func_7()` does not correctly compute the values of `x_i` and then use them to reconstruct `a_i`.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. The program reads the input `n` and the array `b`.
2. It initializes a variable `s` to accumulate the sum of elements in `b`.
3. In the loop, it updates `s` by adding each element of `b` and prints the result of `s`.

This approach does not correctly compute the values of `x_i` or reconstruct the original array `a`. The value of `x_i` should be the maximum of the elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, but this is not computed or used in the given implementation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain the running maximum of the elements seen so far and use this maximum to reconstruct the original array `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the array a with zeros
    a = [0] * n
    
    # Initialize the running maximum
    max_so_far = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = b[i] + max_so_far
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, a[i])
    
    print(" ".join(map(str, a)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_7()
```

This corrected version correctly reconstructs the original array `a` by maintaining the running maximum of the elements seen so far and using it to compute each `a_i`.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the correctness is **False**.
