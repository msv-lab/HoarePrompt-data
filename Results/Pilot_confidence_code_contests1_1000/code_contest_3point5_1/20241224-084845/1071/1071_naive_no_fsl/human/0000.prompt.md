You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alicia has an array, a_1, a_2, …, a_n, of non-negative integers. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, she has found a non-negative integer x_i = max(0, a_1, …, a_{i-1}). Note that for i=1, x_i = 0.

For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, then x = \{0, 0, 1, 2, 2\}.

Then, she calculated an array, b_1, b_2, …, b_n: b_i = a_i - x_i.

For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, b = \{0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 0-2, 3-2\} = \{0, 1, 1, -2, 1\}.

Alicia gives you the values b_1, b_2, …, b_n and asks you to restore the values a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Can you help her solve the problem?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) – the number of elements in Alicia's array.

The next line contains n integers, b_1, b_2, …, b_n (-10^9 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that for the given array b there is a solution a_1, a_2, …, a_n, for all elements of which the following is true: 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Output

Print n integers, a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), such that if you calculate x according to the statement, b_1 will be equal to a_1 - x_1, b_2 will be equal to a_2 - x_2, ..., and b_n will be equal to a_n - x_n.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution for the given tests. It can be shown that the solution is unique.

Examples

Input


5
0 1 1 -2 1


Output


0 1 2 0 3 

Input


3
1000 999999000 -1000000000


Output


1000 1000000000 0 

Input


5
2 1 2 2 3


Output


2 3 5 7 10 

Note

The first test was described in the problem statement.

In the second test, if Alicia had an array a = \{1000, 1000000000, 0\}, then x = \{0, 1000, 1000000000\} and b = \{1000-0, 1000000000-1000, 0-1000000000\} = \{1000, 999999000, -1000000000\}.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
