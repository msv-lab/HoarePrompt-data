Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `x`. According to the problem description, if `k > x`, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that each segment of at least `k` consecutive pictures has at least one picture reposted. However, the program does not check this condition and tries to compute a solution, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5 3 2
5 1 3 10 1
```

Expected output:
```
-1
```

However, the program will output a non-negative value because it does not properly handle the case where `k > x`. Specifically, the program initializes the dictionary `rpr` without considering the constraint that `k > x` makes the problem unsolvable. This leads to incorrect behavior and the program outputs a non-negative value instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure that `k <= x` before proceeding with the dynamic programming approach. If `k > x`, the program should immediately output `-1`.
