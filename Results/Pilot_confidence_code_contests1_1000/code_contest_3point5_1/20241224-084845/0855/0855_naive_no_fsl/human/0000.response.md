Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of pens and pencils exceeds the capacity of the pencilcase (`k`). Specifically, the program calculates `y` as `k - x`, but it does not check if `y` is sufficient to cover the required number of practical classes (`b`). This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the second test case from the provided input:
```
7 5 4 5 2
```
- `a = 7` (lectures)
- `b = 5` (practical classes)
- `c = 4` (lectures per pen)
- `d = 5` (practical classes per pencil)
- `k = 2` (writing implements)

The program calculates:
- `x = ceil(7 / 4) = 2` (pens needed)
- `y = k - x = 2 - 2 = 0` (pencils needed)

However, since `y` is 0, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because Polycarp still needs at least 1 pencil to cover the 5 practical classes.

A correct implementation would include a check to ensure that the calculated number of pencils (`y`) is sufficient to cover the practical classes. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import math
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c, d, k = map(int, input().split())
        x = math.ceil(a / c)
        y = max(0, k - x)
        if y >= math.ceil(b / d):
            print(f"{x} {y}")
        else:
            print("-1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of pencils (`y`) is checked against the requirement for practical classes before determining the final output.
