You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Tomorrow is a difficult day for Polycarp: he has to attend a lectures and b practical classes at the university! Since Polycarp is a diligent student, he is going to attend all of them.

While preparing for the university, Polycarp wonders whether he can take enough writing implements to write all of the lectures and draw everything he has to during all of the practical classes. Polycarp writes lectures using a pen (he can't use a pencil to write lectures!); he can write down c lectures using one pen, and after that it runs out of ink. During practical classes Polycarp draws blueprints with a pencil (he can't use a pen to draw blueprints!); one pencil is enough to draw all blueprints during d practical classes, after which it is unusable.

Polycarp's pencilcase can hold no more than k writing implements, so if Polycarp wants to take x pens and y pencils, they will fit in the pencilcase if and only if x + y ≤ k.

Now Polycarp wants to know how many pens and pencils should he take. Help him to determine it, or tell that his pencilcase doesn't have enough room for all the implements he needs tomorrow!

Note that you don't have to minimize the number of writing implements (though their total number must not exceed k).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then the test cases follow.

Each test case is described by one line containing five integers a, b, c, d and k, separated by spaces (1 ≤ a, b, c, d, k ≤ 100) — the number of lectures Polycarp has to attend, the number of practical classes Polycarp has to attend, the number of lectures which can be written down using one pen, the number of practical classes for which one pencil is enough, and the number of writing implements that can fit into Polycarp's pencilcase, respectively.

In hacks it is allowed to use only one test case in the input, so t = 1 should be satisfied.

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

If the pencilcase can't hold enough writing implements to use them during all lectures and practical classes, print one integer -1. Otherwise, print two non-negative integers x and y — the number of pens and pencils Polycarp should put in his pencilcase. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of writing implements (though their total number must not exceed k).

Example

Input


3
7 5 4 5 8
7 5 4 5 2
20 53 45 26 4


Output


7 1
-1
1 3

Note

There are many different answers for the first test case; x = 7, y = 1 is only one of them. For example, x = 3, y = 1 is also correct.

x = 1, y = 3 is the only correct answer for the third test case.
Program:
```
import os
import sys
import math

def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        count = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        while count > 0:
            str_list = sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n').split(' ')
            number_list = [int(str(i)) for i in str_list]
            if len(number_list) < 5:
                break
            a = number_list[0]
            b = number_list[1]
            c = number_list[2]
            d = number_list[3]
            k = number_list[4]
            x = int(math.ceil(a / c))
            y = k - x
            if y >= int(math.ceil(b / d)):
                print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y))
            else:
                print('-1')
            count = count - 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
