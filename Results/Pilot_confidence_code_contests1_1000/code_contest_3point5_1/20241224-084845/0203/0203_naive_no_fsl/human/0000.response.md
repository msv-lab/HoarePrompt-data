Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero correctly. In such a case, the program should ignore the sardine since it doesn't affect the selection process, but the current implementation increments the count which leads to incorrect results. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
1 2
-1 1
```

The correct output should be 4 (choosing none, choosing the first sardine, choosing the second sardine, or choosing the third sardine). However, due to the incorrect handling of the `(0, 0)` sardine, the program will include this sardine in its calculations, leading to an incorrect result.
