Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where neither Alice nor Bob like enough books to meet the requirement of \(k\) books each. Specifically, the program does not ensure that after sorting and selecting books, both Alice and Bob have at least \(k\) liked books in their chosen set. Here is an example that demonstrates this issue:

### Example:
Consider the following input:
```
5 3
3 0 0
2 1 0
3 1 0
5 0 1
3 0 1
```

According to the problem description, Alice needs to like at least 3 books and Bob also needs to like at least 3 books. However, in this example:
- Alice likes only 2 books (books 2 and 3).
- Bob likes only 2 books (books 2 and 5).

The program sorts the books by reading time and tries to pick books while maintaining the counts of liked books for Alice and Bob. However, since neither Alice nor Bob can get exactly 3 liked books, the program should output \(-1\), indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the condition.

However, the provided program does not handle this edge case properly and may incorrectly output the total reading time without checking if the conditions are met. This is evident because the program continues to accumulate reading times even if the required number of liked books is not reached for both Alice and Bob.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle the case where the requirement of \(k\) liked books cannot be satisfied for either Alice or Bob.
