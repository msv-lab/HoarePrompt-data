Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `v` is 1 or `n`. Specifically, when `v` is 1, the current implementation swaps `v-1` (which is 0) with the second server (which is 2), which is incorrect because the server indices start from 1. This can be seen in the example below:

### Test Case
Input:
```
5 6 1
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
```
1 3
3 2
2 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

The output is not correct because it suggests that the system remains connected even after server 1 fails. Therefore, the program does not correctly identify that it's impossible to satisfy the condition when `v` is 1 or `n`.
