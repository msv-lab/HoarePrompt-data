Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the sequence of button presses forms a cycle that does not include Button 2. Specifically, the program assumes that the sequence will either reach Button 2 or form a cycle that does not include Button 2, but it does not check if Button 2 is part of the cycle.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
1
2
```

In this case, the correct behavior would be to output `2` because pressing Button 1 turns off the light and turns on Button 3, and then pressing Button 3 turns off the light and turns on Button 2. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `-1` because it does not account for the fact that Button 2 is reachable.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if Button 2 is ever reached during the sequence of presses. Here is a corrected version:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input())
    A = [int(input()) - 1 for _ in range(N)]
    
    index = 0
    counter = 0
    visited = set()
    
    while index != 1 and index not in visited:
        if index == 1:
            break
        visited.add(index)
        counter += 1
        index = A[index]
    
    if index == 1:
        # Check if Button 2 is reachable
        index = 0
        visited = set()
        while index != 1 and index not in visited:
            if index == 1:
                break
            visited.add(index)
            counter += 1
            index = A[index]
        
        if index != 1:
            counter = -1
    
    print(counter)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks if Button 2 is reachable and handles cases where the sequence of button presses forms a cycle that does not include Button 2.
