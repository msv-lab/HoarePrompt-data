You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to gain muscle, and decides to work out at AtCoder Gym.

The exercise machine at the gym has N buttons, and exactly one of the buttons is lighten up. These buttons are numbered 1 through N. When Button i is lighten up and you press it, the light is turned off, and then Button a_i will be lighten up. It is possible that i=a_i. When Button i is not lighten up, nothing will happen by pressing it.

Initially, Button 1 is lighten up. Takahashi wants to quit pressing buttons when Button 2 is lighten up.

Determine whether this is possible. If the answer is positive, find the minimum number of times he needs to press buttons.

Constraints

* 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ a_i ≤ N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1
a_2
:
a_N


Output

Print -1 if it is impossible to lighten up Button 2. Otherwise, print the minimum number of times we need to press buttons in order to lighten up Button 2.

    func_1(sys.argv)

def func_1(argv):
    N = sys.stdin.readline()
    while N:
        A = [int(raw_input()) - 1 for i in xrange(0, int(N))]
        counter = 0
        visited = set()
        index = 0
        while index != 1 and index not in visited:
            visited.add(index)
            counter += 1
            index = A[index]
        if index != 1:
            counter = -1
        print('{0}'.format(counter))
        N = sys.stdin.readline()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
