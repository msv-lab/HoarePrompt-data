Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in how it handles the cost optimization for replacing the "?" characters. Specifically, the program always replaces a "?" with a closing bracket ')' and uses the difference between the costs of replacing it with an opening '(' and a closing ')' to decide whether to change it back to an opening bracket. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost solution.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
(?)
1 2
```

Expected output:
```
3
(?)
```

However, the program will output:
```
3
)
```

This is because the program always replaces "?" with ')', and only changes it back to '(' if it was originally more expensive to change it to ')'. In this case, it would be cheaper to replace the '?' with '(' initially, resulting in the optimal solution.

The correct approach would involve keeping track of both opening and closing brackets and ensuring the minimum cost is achieved by considering both replacements for each '?'. The current implementation does not account for this, leading to potential suboptimal solutions.
