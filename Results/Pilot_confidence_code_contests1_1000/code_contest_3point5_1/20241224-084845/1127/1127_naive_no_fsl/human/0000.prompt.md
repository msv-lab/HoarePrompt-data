You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is yet another problem on regular bracket sequences.

A bracket sequence is called regular, if by inserting "+" and "1" into it we get a correct mathematical expression. For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are regular, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not. You have a pattern of a bracket sequence that consists of characters "(", ")" and "?". You have to replace each character "?" with a bracket so, that you get a regular bracket sequence.

For each character "?" the cost of its replacement with "(" and ")" is given. Among all the possible variants your should choose the cheapest.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty pattern of even length, consisting of characters "(", ")" and "?". Its length doesn't exceed 5·104. Then there follow m lines, where m is the number of characters "?" in the pattern. Each line contains two integer numbers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 106), where ai is the cost of replacing the i-th character "?" with an opening bracket, and bi — with a closing one.

Output

Print the cost of the optimal regular bracket sequence in the first line, and the required sequence in the second.

Print -1, if there is no answer. If the answer is not unique, print any of them.

        if sqs[i] == ord('('):
            l += 1
        elif sqs[i] == ord(')'):
            l -= 1
        else:
            (a, b) = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split()]
            l -= 1
            cost += b
            sqs[i] = ')'
            bisect.insort(s, (b - a, i))
        if l < 0:
            if len(s) == 0:
                break
            (v, ii) = s.pop()
            cost -= v
            sqs[ii] = '('
            l += 2
        i += 1
    if l == 0:
        print(cost)
        print(str(sqs))
    else:
        print(-1)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
