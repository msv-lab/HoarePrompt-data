You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mahmoud and Ehab are on the third stage of their adventures now. As you know, Dr. Evil likes sets. This time he won't show them any set from his large collection, but will ask them to create a new set to replenish his beautiful collection of sets.

Dr. Evil has his favorite evil integer x. He asks Mahmoud and Ehab to find a set of n distinct non-negative integers such the bitwise-xor sum of the integers in it is exactly x. Dr. Evil doesn't like big numbers, so any number in the set shouldn't be greater than 106.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ x ≤ 105) — the number of elements in the set and the desired bitwise-xor, respectively.

Output

If there is no such set, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, on the first line print "YES" (without quotes) and on the second line print n distinct integers, denoting the elements in the set is any order. If there are multiple solutions you can print any of them.

Examples

Input

5 5


Output

YES
1 2 4 5 7

Input

3 6


Output

YES
1 2 5

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
