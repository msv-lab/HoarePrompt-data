Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program seems to be attempting to generate binary representations of numbers, but it does not actually construct polynomials as required. Specifically, the variables `x` and `y` are being updated in a Fibonacci-like manner, but they do not represent the coefficients of the polynomials. 

To construct polynomials that require exactly `n` steps in the Euclidean algorithm, the program needs to generate polynomials where each step reduces the degree by exactly one, starting from the highest degree down to zero. The current implementation does not generate such polynomials.

For example, for `n=1`, the correct output should be:
```
1
0 1
0
1
```
But the provided program outputs:
```
1
1 1
0
1
```
This is incorrect because the second polynomial has a degree greater than zero, which does not match the requirement that the first polynomial should have a higher degree than the second.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
