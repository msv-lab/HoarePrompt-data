You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Suppose you have two polynomials <image> and <image>. Then polynomial <image> can be uniquely represented in the following way:

<image>

This can be done using [long division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division). Here, <image> denotes the degree of polynomial P(x). <image> is called the remainder of division of polynomial <image> by polynomial <image>, it is also denoted as <image>. 

Since there is a way to divide polynomials with remainder, we can define Euclid's algorithm of finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. The algorithm takes two polynomials <image>. If the polynomial <image> is zero, the result is <image>, otherwise the result is the value the algorithm returns for pair <image>. On each step the degree of the second argument decreases, so the algorithm works in finite number of steps. But how large that number could be? You are to answer this question. 

You are given an integer n. You have to build two polynomials with degrees not greater than n, such that their coefficients are integers not exceeding 1 by their absolute value, the leading coefficients (ones with the greatest power of x) are equal to one, and the described Euclid's algorithm performs exactly n steps finding their greatest common divisor. Moreover, the degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second. By a step of the algorithm we mean the transition from pair <image> to pair <image>. 

Input

You are given a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of steps of the algorithm you need to reach.

Output

Print two polynomials in the following format.

In the first line print a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the degree of the polynomial. 

In the second line print m + 1 integers between  - 1 and 1 — the coefficients of the polynomial, from constant to leading. 

The degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second polynomial, the leading coefficients should be equal to 1. Euclid's algorithm should perform exactly n steps when called using these polynomials.

If there is no answer for the given n, print -1.

If there are multiple answer, print any of them.

Note

In the second example you can print polynomials x2 - 1 and x. The sequence of transitions is

(x2 - 1, x) → (x, - 1) → ( - 1, 0).

There are two steps in it.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    (x, y) = (1, 2)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        (x, y) = (y, x + y)
    (s, t) = (bin(y)[2:][::-1], bin(x)[2:][::-1])
    print(len(s) - 1)
    for c in s:
        print(c, end=' ')
    print()
    print(len(t) - 1)
    for c in t:
        print(c, end=' ')
    print()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
