Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the stock prices are decreasing over time. Specifically, the program does not ensure that M-kun sells his stocks before the price drops further. Let's consider the following input:

```
N = 4
arr = [200, 180, 160, 140]
```

According to the problem description, M-kun should buy stocks when the price is high and sell them when the price is low to maximize his money. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this optimal strategy. For instance, the program might not sell the stocks at the peak price but keep them hoping for a higher price, which is not optimal.

To illustrate, let's run the program with the above input:

```
4
200 180 160 140
```

The expected output is 1400 (M-kun should buy at 200, sell at 180, buy again at 180, sell at 160, buy again at 160, and finally sell at 140). However, the program might not achieve this optimal result due to the current logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not always follow the optimal strategy for maximizing the amount of money M-kun can have at the end.
