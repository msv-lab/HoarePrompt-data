You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: To become a millionaire, M-kun has decided to make money by trading in the next N days. Currently, he has 1000 yen and no stocks - only one kind of stock is issued in the country where he lives.

He is famous across the country for his ability to foresee the future. He already knows that the price of one stock in the next N days will be as follows:

* A_1 yen on the 1-st day, A_2 yen on the 2-nd day, ..., A_N yen on the N-th day.



In the i-th day, M-kun can make the following trade any number of times (possibly zero), within the amount of money and stocks that he has at the time.

* Buy stock: Pay A_i yen and receive one stock.
* Sell stock: Sell one stock for A_i yen.



What is the maximum possible amount of money that M-kun can have in the end by trading optimally?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 80
* 100 \leq A_i \leq 200
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N


Output

Print the maximum possible amount of money that M-kun can have in the end, as an integer.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
