Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the division of the island among the parties. Specifically, the program uses a placeholder `'?'` to represent unassigned squares and attempts to assign parties to these squares by always moving left or right. However, this approach does not guarantee that the assigned areas will be connected, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 1 4 4
1 2 3 4
```

The program's output would be:
```
abbd
cccd
...d
...d
```

This output is incorrect because the area assigned to the fourth party is not connected. According to the problem, the fourth party should be assigned to a connected area, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

A correct solution would need to ensure that the assigned areas are connected and that the entire island is divided according to the party sizes. The current implementation lacks this connectivity check and does not guarantee a correct division.
