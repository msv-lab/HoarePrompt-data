You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A revolution took place on the Buka Island. New government replaced the old one. The new government includes n parties and each of them is entitled to some part of the island according to their contribution to the revolution. However, they can't divide the island.

The island can be conventionally represented as two rectangles a × b and c × d unit squares in size correspondingly. The rectangles are located close to each other. At that, one of the sides with the length of a and one of the sides with the length of c lie on one line. You can see this in more details on the picture.

<image>

The i-th party is entitled to a part of the island equal to xi unit squares. Every such part should fully cover several squares of the island (it is not allowed to cover the squares partially) and be a connected figure. A "connected figure" presupposes that from any square of this party one can move to any other square of the same party moving through edge-adjacent squares also belonging to that party.

Your task is to divide the island between parties.

Input

The first line contains 5 space-separated integers — a, b, c, d and n (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 50, b ≠ d, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26). The second line contains n space-separated numbers. The i-th of them is equal to number xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ a × b + c × d). It is guaranteed that <image>.

Output

If dividing the island between parties in the required manner is impossible, print "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "YES" (also without the quotes) and, starting from the next line, print max(b, d) lines each containing a + c characters. To mark what square should belong to what party, use lowercase Latin letters. For the party that is first in order in the input data, use "a", for the second one use "b" and so on. Use "." for the squares that belong to the sea. The first symbol of the second line of the output data should correspond to the square that belongs to the rectangle a × b. The last symbol of the second line should correspond to the square that belongs to the rectangle c × d.

If there are several solutions output any.

                j -= 1
            elif j + 1 < len(res[i]) and res[i][j + 1] == '?':
                j += 1
            else:

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
