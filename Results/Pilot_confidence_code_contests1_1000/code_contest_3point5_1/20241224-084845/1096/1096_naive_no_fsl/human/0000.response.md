Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find semi-common multiples. Specifically, the function `myfunc` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, which leads to a NameError when running the program. Moreover, the logic for calculating the least common multiple (LCM) and determining the number of semi-common multiples is incorrect.

To verify this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2 50
6 10
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

The program should calculate the LCM of 6 and 10, which is 30. The semi-common multiples of 6 and 10 are numbers that can be written as \(6 \times (p + 0.5)\) and \(10 \times (q + 0.5)\) for some non-negative integers \(p\) and \(q\). For \(X = 30\), the possible values are 15 and 45. However, the program incorrectly handles the LCM calculation and the division by 2, leading to an incorrect result.

Since the program fails to handle this case correctly, the correctness is **False**.
