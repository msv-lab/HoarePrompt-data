Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses binary search to find the maximum number of cookies Apollinaria can bake. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. Specifically, the function does not correctly account for the transformation of magic powder into ingredients.

In the given examples, the program works correctly because the transformations and comparisons are straightforward. However, consider a more complex case:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3 5
  2 3 4
  10 7 15
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - The maximum number of cookies Apollinaria can bake is 3.
  - Here's the breakdown:
    - For the first ingredient: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) cookies possible.
    - For the second ingredient: \( \frac{7}{3} \approx 2 \) cookies possible.
    - For the third ingredient: \( \frac{15}{4} \approx 3 \) cookies possible.
  - Using 5 cookies requires \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) grams of the first ingredient, \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) grams of the second ingredient, and \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) grams of the third ingredient.
  - With 5 grams of magic powder, we can convert it to any ingredient to help meet the requirement. The optimal strategy is to convert magic powder to the second ingredient to maximize the number of cookies.
  - By converting 1 gram of magic powder to 3 grams of the second ingredient, we can bake 3 cookies.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not handle the conversion of magic powder effectively. It directly checks if the ingredients are sufficient without considering the optimal use of magic powder.

### Incorrect Program Behavior:
- In the given example, the program will not correctly handle the conversion of magic powder to maximize the number of cookies. Instead, it will simply check if the direct ingredient amounts are sufficient, which might lead to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal use of magic powder to maximize the number of cookies.
