You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem is given in two versions that differ only by constraints. If you can solve this problem in large constraints, then you can just write a single solution to the both versions. If you find the problem too difficult in large constraints, you can write solution to the simplified version only.

Waking up in the morning, Apollinaria decided to bake cookies. To bake one cookie, she needs n ingredients, and for each ingredient she knows the value ai — how many grams of this ingredient one needs to bake a cookie. To prepare one cookie Apollinaria needs to use all n ingredients.

Apollinaria has bi gram of the i-th ingredient. Also she has k grams of a magic powder. Each gram of magic powder can be turned to exactly 1 gram of any of the n ingredients and can be used for baking cookies.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria is able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.

Input

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000) — the number of ingredients and the number of grams of the magic powder.

The second line contains the sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, needed to bake one cookie.

The third line contains the sequence b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 1000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, which Apollinaria has.

Output

Print the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria will be able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.

Examples

Input

3 1
2 1 4
11 3 16


Output

4


Input

4 3
4 3 5 6
11 12 14 20


Output

3

Note

In the first sample it is profitably for Apollinaria to make the existing 1 gram of her magic powder to ingredient with the index 2, then Apollinaria will be able to bake 4 cookies.

In the second sample Apollinaria should turn 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 1 and 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 3. Then Apollinaria will be able to bake 3 cookies. The remaining 1 gram of the magic powder can be left, because it can't be used to increase the answer.
Program:
```
a = []
b = []
(n, k) = raw_input().split()
n = int(n)
k = int(k)
a = raw_input().split()
b = raw_input().split()
for i in range(n):
    a[i] = int(a[i])
    b[i] = int(b[i])
ini = 0
fin = 10000000
while ini + 1 < fin:
    mid = (ini + fin) / 2
    if func_1(mid, n, k):
        ini = mid
    else:
        fin = mid - 1
if func_1(fin, n, k):
    print(fin)
else:
    print(ini)

def func_1(m, n, k):
    x = k
    for i in range(n):
        if m * a[i] <= b[i]:
            continue
        x -= m * a[i] - b[i]
    return x >= 0


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
