Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the case where the sum of positive and negative contributions is exactly balanced (i.e., `negsum == possum`). In this scenario, the program should calculate the exact balance between the positive and negative contributions to achieve the desired temperature `T`. However, the current implementation does not handle this edge case properly.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 12
3 4 5
8 16 10
```

In this case:
- `possum = (16 - 12) * 4 + (10 - 12) * 5 = 4 * 4 + (-2) * 5 = 16 - 10 = 6`
- `negsum = (8 - 12) * 3 = -4 * 3 = -12`

Here, `abs(negsum) == possum`, so the program should calculate the exact balance between `pos` and `neg` contributions. However, the current implementation does not account for this and might incorrectly terminate without balancing the contributions.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `negsum` and `possum` are equal by iteratively adjusting the contributions until the desired temperature is achieved.
