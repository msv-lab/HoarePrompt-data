Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the input:

```
6
1 1 1 1 1 5
```

According to the problem description, the farthest vertex from vertex 6 should be at a distance of 5. However, for this input, the program will incorrectly output `Impossible` because it checks if the count of `l` (which is 3 in this case) is 2, and since it's not, it prints `Impossible`. 

However, a tree satisfying the conditions can exist. For example, consider the following tree structure:

```
   1
  / \
 2---3
  \ / \
   4---5---6
```

In this tree, the farthest vertex from vertex 6 is at a distance of 5, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify valid cases, making it incorrect.
