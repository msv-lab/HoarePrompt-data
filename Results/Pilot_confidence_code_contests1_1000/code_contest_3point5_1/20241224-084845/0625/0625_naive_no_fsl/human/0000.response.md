Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to obtain the lexicographically maximum string after performing the specified operations. The algorithm iterates through the string, maintaining a counter of character frequencies. It removes characters that are not in lexicographical order relative to the previously added characters, ensuring the resulting string is lexicographically maximum and has unique characters.

The core logic in the function `func_29()` ensures that characters are processed in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order while removing duplicates. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Character Frequency Count**: The program uses a `counter` to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Character Removal Logic**: For each character in the string, it checks whether the character should be removed based on the current lexicographical order and frequency.
3. **Result Construction**: The result string is built by appending characters that meet the criteria and skipping those that do not.

Since the provided implementation follows the described logic accurately and handles all cases where characters need to be removed to ensure the lexicographical maximality, the program is correct for all potential cases. There are no apparent edge cases or examples where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the problem description.
