Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining how many leaves Alyona picks. Specifically, the program does not handle the condition where Alyona does not pick a leaf if it matches the color and species of a leaf she already has. Instead, the program counts distinct combinations of species and color without considering whether these combinations are duplicates within the input.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
birch yellow
maple red
birch yellow
```

The correct output should be `2` because Alyona will pick the first and second leaves but not the third one since its combination (birch yellow) is the same as the first leaf. However, the provided program will output `3` because it only checks for consecutive duplicates and does not account for non-consecutive duplicates.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of all previously seen combinations and check against them, rather than just comparing adjacent elements.
