You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As I was cleaning up the warehouse, I found an old document that describes how to get to the treasures of my ancestors. The following was written in this ancient document.


1. First, stand 1m east of the well on the outskirts of the town and turn straight toward the well.
2. Turn clockwise 90 degrees, go straight for 1m, and turn straight toward the well.
3. Turn clockwise 90 degrees, go straight for 1m, and turn straight toward the well.
Four.                   〃
Five.                   〃
6::


From the second line onward, exactly the same thing was written. You wanted to find the treasure, but found it awkward. Unlike in the past, the building is in the way, and you can't see the well even if you go straight in the direction of the well, or you can't go straight even if you try to go straight for 1m. In addition, this ancient document has nearly 1000 lines, and it takes a considerable amount of time and physical strength to work according to the ancient document. Fortunately, however, you can take advantage of your computer.

Enter the number of lines n written in the old document and create a program that outputs the location of the treasure. However, n is a positive integer between 2 and 1,000.



input

Given multiple datasets. For each dataset, one integer n, which represents the number of lines in the old document, is given on each line.

The input ends with -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

Assuming that there is a treasure at the position x (m) to the east and y (m) to the north from the well on the outskirts of the town, output each data set in the following format.


x
y


The output is a real number and may contain an error of 0.01 or less.

Example

Input

3
6
-1


Output

0.29
1.71
-2.31
0.80
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin
from math import cos, sin, atan2, pi

def func():
    PI2 = pi / 2
    L = [None, (1.0, 0.0)]
    for _ in range(2, 1001):
        (x, y) = L[-1]
        rad = atan2(y, x) + PI2
        L.append((x + cos(rad), y + sin(rad)))
    for line in stdin:
        n = int(line)
        if n == -1:
            break
        print('{:0.2f}\n{:0.2f}'.format(*L[n]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
