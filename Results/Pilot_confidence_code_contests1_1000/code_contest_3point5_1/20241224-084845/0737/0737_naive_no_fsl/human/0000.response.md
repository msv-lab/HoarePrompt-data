Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the starting point 1 meter east of the well and iteratively calculates the new position after each 90-degree clockwise turn and 1-meter move. The program uses trigonometric functions to compute the new coordinates based on the angle of rotation.

Given the iterative nature of the calculation and the use of `atan2` to determine the direction, the program should work for any valid input within the specified range (2 to 1000 lines). The precomputed list `L` stores the positions after each step, allowing the program to retrieve the correct position for any given line count `n`.

Since the program handles the input correctly and computes the positions accurately, it meets the requirements for all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
