Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter does not exceed \(d\). Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the points are already within the required diameter constraint without needing any removals. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The program reads the input but does not properly initialize variables or handle the sorting of points.
2. The loop for calculating the minimum number of points to remove has issues in how it iterates and updates the count. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter does not exceed \(d\).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 3 5
```

The correct output should be 0 since the points are already within the required diameter of 3. However, the program might not handle this case correctly due to the logic flaws.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, d = map(int, input().split())
    points = list(map(int, input().split()))
    points.sort()
    
    left = 0
    min_removals = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(n):
        while points[right] - points[left] > d:
            left += 1
        min_removals = min(min_removals, n - (right - left + 1))
    
    print(min_removals)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of points to remove to meet the diameter constraint.
