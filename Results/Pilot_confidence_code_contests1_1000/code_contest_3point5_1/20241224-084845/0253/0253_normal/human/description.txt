Let's play Hit and Blow game. A imagines four numbers and B guesses the numbers. After B picks out four numbers, A answers:

* The number of numbers which have the same place with numbers A imagined (Hit)
* The number of numbers included (but different place) in the numbers A imagined (Blow)



For example, if A imagined numbers:


9 1 8 2


and B chose:


4 1 5 9


A should say 1 Hit and 1 Blow.

Write a program which reads four numbers A imagined and four numbers B chose and prints the number of Hit and Blow respectively. You may assume that the four numbers are all different and within from 0 to 9.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset set consists of:


a1 a2 a3 a4
b1 b2 b3 b4


, where ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 9) is i-th number A imagined and bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ 9) is i-th number B chose.

The input ends with EOF. The number of datasets is less than or equal to 50.

Output

For each dataset, print the number of Hit and Blow in a line. These two numbers should be separated by a space.

Example

Input

9 1 8 2
4 1 5 9
4 6 8 2
4 6 3 2


Output

1 1
3 0
