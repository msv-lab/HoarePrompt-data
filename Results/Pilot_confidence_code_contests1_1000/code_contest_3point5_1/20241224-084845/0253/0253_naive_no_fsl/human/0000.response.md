Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of Blow. According to the problem description, a Blow is awarded for numbers chosen by B that are present in the numbers imagined by A but in different positions. However, the current implementation of `blow` is incorrect because it does not account for the exact count of numbers that are in A but not in the same position as in B.

Let's consider an example:
- A imagined numbers: `9 1 8 2`
- B chose: `4 1 5 9`

According to the description:
- Hit: 1 (since '1' is in the same position)
- Blow: 1 (since '9' is in A but not in the same position)

However, the program incorrectly calculates Blow as 2, because it counts '9' twice (once in the first position and once in the last position).

To fix this, we need to ensure that we only count each number in A once for Blow. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func():
    while True:
        a = stdin.readline().strip()
        if not a:
            break
        b = stdin.readline().strip()
        
        hit = sum((int(a[i] == b[i]) for i in range(4)))
        blow = sum((1 for i in range(4) if b[i] in a and a[i] != b[i]))
        
        print(hit, blow)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each number in A is only counted once for Blow, and the program will now work correctly for all cases.
