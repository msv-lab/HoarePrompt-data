You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently, a start up by two students of a state university of city F gained incredible popularity. Now it's time to start a new company. But what do we call it?

The market analysts came up with a very smart plan: the name of the company should be identical to its reflection in a mirror! In other words, if we write out the name of the company on a piece of paper in a line (horizontally, from left to right) with large English letters, then put this piece of paper in front of the mirror, then the reflection of the name in the mirror should perfectly match the line written on the piece of paper.

There are many suggestions for the company name, so coming up to the mirror with a piece of paper for each name wouldn't be sensible. The founders of the company decided to automatize this process. They asked you to write a program that can, given a word, determine whether the word is a 'mirror' word or not.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty name that needs to be checked. The name contains at most 105 large English letters. The name will be written with the next sans serif font: 

<image>

Output

Print 'YES' (without the quotes), if the given name matches its mirror reflection. Otherwise, print 'NO' (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

AHA


Output

YES


Input

Z


Output

NO


Input

XO


Output

NO
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    _real_letters = ['A', 'H', 'I', 'M', 'O', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y']
    _name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    N = len(_name)
    _middle = N >> 1
    _decision = 'YES'
    if _name[_middle] not in _real_letters:
        _decision = 'NO'
    else:
        j = N - 1
        for i in range(_middle):
            if _name[i] != _name[j]:
                _decision = 'NO'
                break
            if _name[i] not in _real_letters:
                _decision = 'NO'
                break
            j -= 1
    sys.stdout.write(str(_decision) + '\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
