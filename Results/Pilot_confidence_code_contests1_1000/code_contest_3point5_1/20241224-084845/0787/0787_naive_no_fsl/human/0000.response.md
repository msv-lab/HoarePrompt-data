Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of having enough pairs of `1` and `-1` within the queried range `[l, r]` to make the sum zero. 

Consider the following input:
```
5 5
-1 1 1 1 -1
1 1
2 3
3 5
2 5
1 5
```

According to the problem description, the correct outputs should be:
```
0
1
0
1
0
```

However, the given program outputs:
```
0
1
0
0
0
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program only checks if the length of the queried range is even and if the count of `-1`s (or `1`s) is sufficient to form pairs, without properly rearranging the elements within the range to check if a valid subarray sum can be achieved. 

For example, in the third query (`3 5`), the program incorrectly outputs `0` because it does not attempt to rearrange the elements `[1, 1, -1]` to see if they can sum to zero. The correct output should be `1` since we can rearrange them to `1, -1, 1` which sums to zero.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to rearrange elements within the queried range to verify if the sum can be made zero.
