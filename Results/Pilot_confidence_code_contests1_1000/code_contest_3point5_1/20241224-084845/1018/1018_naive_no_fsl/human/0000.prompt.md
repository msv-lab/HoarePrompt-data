You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cities and n - 1 roads in the Seven Kingdoms, each road connects two cities and we can reach any city from any other by the roads.

Theon and Yara Greyjoy are on a horse in the first city, they are starting traveling through the roads. But the weather is foggy, so they can’t see where the horse brings them. When the horse reaches a city (including the first one), it goes to one of the cities connected to the current city. But it is a strange horse, it only goes to cities in which they weren't before. In each such city, the horse goes with equal probabilities and it stops when there are no such cities. 

Let the length of each road be 1. The journey starts in the city 1. What is the expected length (expected value of length) of their journey? You can read about expected (average) value by the link <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value>.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — number of cities.

Then n - 1 lines follow. The i-th line of these lines contains two integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi) — the cities connected by the i-th road.

It is guaranteed that one can reach any city from any other by the roads.

Output

Print a number — the expected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1.

Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

4
1 2
1 3
2 4


Output

1.500000000000000


Input

5
1 2
1 3
3 4
2 5


Output

2.000000000000000

Note

In the first sample, their journey may end in cities 3 or 4 with equal probability. The distance to city 3 is 1 and to city 4 is 2, so the expected length is 1.5.

In the second sample, their journey may end in city 4 or 5. The distance to the both cities is 2, so the expected length is 2.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
graph = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(n - 1):
    (one, two) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    graph[one].append(two)
    graph[two].append(one)
leaf = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(len(graph)):
    if len(graph[i]) == 1 and i != 1:
        leaf[i] = 1
leaf1 = func_1(graph, 1)
print(leaf1)

def func_1(graph, root):
    count = -1
    visited = [False for i in range(n + 1)]
    queue = [None, root]
    visited[root] = True
    prob = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    prob[1] = 1
    ans = 0
    while queue != 0:
        vertex = queue.pop(0)
        if vertex != None and len(graph[vertex]) == 1 and visited[vertex]:
            ans += leaf[vertex] / prob[vertex]
        if vertex is None:
            count += 1
            queue.append(None)
            if len(queue) == 1:
                break
            else:
                continue
        for neighbour in graph[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbour]:
                if leaf[neighbour] == 1:
                    leaf[neighbour] = count + 1
                if vertex == 1:
                    prob[neighbour] = prob[vertex] * len(graph[vertex])
                else:
                    prob[neighbour] = prob[vertex] * (len(graph[vertex]) - 1)
                visited[neighbour] = True
                queue.append(neighbour)
    return ans

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
