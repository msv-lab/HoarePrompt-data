Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the graph has multiple disconnected components, although the problem guarantees that one can reach any city from any other by the roads. However, a more specific issue is that the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected length of the journey. Specifically, the way the `prob` array is updated and the logic for calculating the expected length is flawed.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4
1 2
1 3
2 4

Output:
1.500000000000000
```

This input matches the first example provided in the problem statement, and the expected output is correct. However, the program logic needs to be revised to properly account for the structure of the graph and the probabilities of moving to unvisited cities.

A corrected approach would involve using dynamic programming or a more structured probabilistic analysis to correctly compute the expected length of the journey. The current implementation does not handle the probabilistic nature of the journey correctly and may give incorrect results for more complex graphs.
