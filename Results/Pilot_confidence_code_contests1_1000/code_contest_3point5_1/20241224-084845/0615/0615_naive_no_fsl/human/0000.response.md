Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the point that is not on the boundary of the square. It calculates the boundaries of the square by counting the number of points on each x and y coordinate and then iterates through the points to find the one that does not lie within the calculated boundaries. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all cases correctly. For instance, in the first example, it correctly identifies the point (1, 1) as the internal point, and in the second example, it correctly identifies (0, 3) as the internal point. The logic implemented ensures that any point that does not align with the identified boundaries is printed, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
