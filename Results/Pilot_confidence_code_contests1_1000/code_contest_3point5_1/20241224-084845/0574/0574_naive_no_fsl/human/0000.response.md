Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sentence ends with "mnida," which is a valid suffix for Korean according to the problem description. The program checks for "desu" and "masu" under the same condition, which will incorrectly classify sentences ending with "mnida" as Japanese. For example, the input "annyeong_hashimnida" should be classified as "KOREAN," but the current implementation will classify it as "JAPANESE."
