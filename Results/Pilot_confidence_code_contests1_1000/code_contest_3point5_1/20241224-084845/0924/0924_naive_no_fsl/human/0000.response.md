Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of different walls that can be constructed with up to `n` bricks and a given width `C`. The program uses dynamic programming techniques to compute factorials and their modular inverses, which are necessary for the combination formula used to count the number of unique wall configurations.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the code:
- It reads the input values `n` and `c`.
- It defines the modulus value as \(10^6 + 3\).
- It uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to compute factorials and combinations modulo the given prime.
- Finally, it calculates the result using the combination formula and prints the output modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

Given the examples and the problem constraints, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. The mathematical approach used is sound, and the implementation is consistent with the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
