You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two binary strings x and y, which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as f(x) and f(y)). You can choose any integer k ≥ 0, calculate the expression s_k = f(x) + f(y) ⋅ 2^k and write the binary representation of s_k in reverse order (let's denote it as rev_k). For example, let x = 1010 and y = 11; you've chosen k = 1 and, since 2^1 = 10_2, so s_k = 1010_2 + 11_2 ⋅ 10_2 = 10000_2 and rev_k = 00001.

For given x and y, you need to choose such k that rev_k is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don't know what does "lexicographically" means).

It's guaranteed that, with given constraints, k exists and is finite.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of queries.

Next 2T lines contain a description of queries: two lines per query. The first line contains one binary string x, consisting of no more than 10^5 characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.

The second line contains one binary string y, consisting of no more than 10^5 characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.

It's guaranteed, that 1 ≤ f(y) ≤ f(x) (where f(x) is the integer represented by x, and f(y) is the integer represented by y), both representations don't have any leading zeroes, the total length of x over all queries doesn't exceed 10^5, and the total length of y over all queries doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

Print T integers (one per query). For each query print such k that rev_k is lexicographically minimal.

Note

The first query was described in the legend.

In the second query, it's optimal to choose k = 3. The 2^3 = 1000_2 so s_3 = 10001_2 + 110_2 ⋅ 1000_2 = 10001 + 110000 = 1000001 and rev_3 = 1000001. For example, if k = 0, then s_0 = 10111 and rev_0 = 11101, but rev_3 = 1000001 is lexicographically smaller than rev_0 = 11101.

In the third query s_0 = 10 and rev_0 = 01. For example, s_2 = 101 and rev_2 = 101. And 01 is lexicographically smaller than 101.

The quote from Wikipedia: "To determine which of two strings of characters comes when arranging in lexicographical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order."
Program:
```
import fileinput

func_3()

def func_1(a):
    print(a)

def func_2(s, I):
    return int(s.split(' ')[I])

def func_3():
    z = 0
    x = 0
    for l in fileinput.input():
        z += 1
        if z < 2:
            continue
        if z % 2 == 0:
            x = ''.join(reversed(l[:-1]))
            continue
        y = ''.join(reversed(l[:-1]))
        I = 0
        while y[I] == '0':
            I += 1
        J = I
        while x[I] == '0':
            I += 1
        func_1(I - J)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
