Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not ensure that all pairs forming inversions are included in the output list. Specifically, the program sorts the indices `j` for each `i` based on the value of `a[j]` and the index `j`, but it does not guarantee that all pairs forming inversions are processed and included in the final list. This can lead to missing pairs in the output list, which violates the requirement that all pairs forming inversions must be present in the list.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
2
1 3
1 2
```
This is incorrect because the pair `(2, 3)` should also be included since it forms an inversion. The correct output should be:
```
2
1 3
2 3
```

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
