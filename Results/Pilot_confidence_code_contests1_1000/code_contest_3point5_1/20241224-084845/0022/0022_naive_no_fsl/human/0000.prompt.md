You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests.

B loves to debug his code. But before he runs the solution and starts debugging, he has to first compile the code.

Initially, the compiler displayed n compilation errors, each of them is represented as a positive integer. After some effort, B managed to fix some mistake and then another one mistake.

However, despite the fact that B is sure that he corrected the two errors, he can not understand exactly what compilation errors disappeared — the compiler of the language which B uses shows errors in the new order every time! B is sure that unlike many other programming languages, compilation errors for his programming language do not depend on each other, that is, if you correct one error, the set of other error does not change.

Can you help B find out exactly what two errors he corrected?

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the initial number of compilation errors.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the errors the compiler displayed for the first time. 

The third line contains n - 1 space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn - 1 — the errors displayed at the second compilation. It is guaranteed that the sequence in the third line contains all numbers of the second string except for exactly one. 

The fourth line contains n - 2 space-separated integers с1, с2, ..., сn - 2 — the errors displayed at the third compilation. It is guaranteed that the sequence in the fourth line contains all numbers of the third line except for exactly one. 

Output

Print two numbers on a single line: the numbers of the compilation errors that disappeared after B made the first and the second correction, respectively. 

Examples

Input

5
1 5 8 123 7
123 7 5 1
5 1 7


Output

8
123


Input

6
1 4 3 3 5 7
3 7 5 4 3
4 3 7 5


Output

1
3

Note

In the first test sample B first corrects the error number 8, then the error number 123.

In the second test sample B first corrects the error number 1, then the error number 3. Note that if there are multiple errors with the same number, B can correct only one of them in one step. 
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    l = []
    l[:n] = map(int, raw_input().split())
    x = []
    y = []
    x[:n] = map(int, raw_input().split())
    y[:n] = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in l:
        if x.count(i) == 0:
            print(i)
            l.remove(i)
            break
    for i in x:
        if y.count(i) == 0:
            print(i)
            break


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
