You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let \mathrm{popcount}(n) be the number of `1`s in the binary representation of n. For example, \mathrm{popcount}(3) = 2, \mathrm{popcount}(7) = 3, and \mathrm{popcount}(0) = 0.

Let f(n) be the number of times the following operation will be done when we repeat it until n becomes 0: "replace n with the remainder when n is divided by \mathrm{popcount}(n)." (It can be proved that, under the constraints of this problem, n always becomes 0 after a finite number of operations.)

For example, when n=7, it becomes 0 after two operations, as follows:

* \mathrm{popcount}(7)=3, so we divide 7 by 3 and replace it with the remainder, 1.
* \mathrm{popcount}(1)=1, so we divide 1 by 1 and replace it with the remainder, 0.



You are given an integer X with N digits in binary. For each integer i such that 1 \leq i \leq N, let X_i be what X becomes when the i-th bit from the top is inverted. Find f(X_1), f(X_2), \ldots, f(X_N).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* X is an integer with N digits in binary, possibly with leading zeros.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
X


Output

Print N lines. The i-th line should contain the value f(X_i).

count = bin(num).count('1')
for i in range(N):
    if not num & 1 << N - i - 1:
        cur_count = count + 1
    else:
        cur_count = count - 1
    if cur_count == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        cur_num = num ^ 1 << N - i - 1
        cur_num = cur_num % cur_count
        print(func_1(cur_num) + 1)

def func_1(x):
    if x in dic:
        return dic[x]
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    tmp = x % bin(x).count('1')
    dic[x] = func_1(tmp) + 1
    return dic[x]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
