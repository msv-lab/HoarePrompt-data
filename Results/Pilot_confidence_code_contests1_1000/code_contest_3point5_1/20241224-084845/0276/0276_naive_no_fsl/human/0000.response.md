Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where Dima inserts random characters (such as digits, signs "more" and "less") into the encoded message. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for these random characters when comparing the encoded message with the list of words. Hereâ€™s a potential test case that demonstrates this:

### Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  i
  love
  you
  <3i<3love<23you<3
  ```

- **Message Received by Inna:**
  ```
  <3i<3love<23you<3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Since the message received by Inna matches the encoded message exactly, the output should be "yes".

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program does not check for random characters inserted by Dima, so it will incorrectly return "no" because it does not account for the possibility of additional characters being present in the encoded message.

To fix this, the program needs to account for any additional characters that Dima might insert while encoding the message. One approach could be to remove all non-alphabetic characters from the encoded message and then compare it with the joined version of the word list.
