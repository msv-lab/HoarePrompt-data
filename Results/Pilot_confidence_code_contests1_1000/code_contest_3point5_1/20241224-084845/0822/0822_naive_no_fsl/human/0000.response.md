Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not account for all possible partitions of the array into two subsequences of length `n` each. Instead, it only considers a few specific partitions by sorting the array and then splitting it into two parts. This approach fails to explore all possible ways to partition the array into two subsequences of length `n`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
2
2 1 2 1
```

The program would only consider the partitions `[2, 1]` vs `[2, 1]` and `[2, 2]` vs `[1, 1]`, but it misses other valid partitions such as `[2, 2]` vs `[1, 1]`, `[2, 1]` vs `[2, 1]` (where indices 1 and 4 are in `p`), and so on. This results in an incorrect calculation of the sum of costs for all valid partitions.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to generate all possible partitions of the array into two subsequences of length `n` and calculate the cost for each partition, which is beyond the scope of the current implementation.
