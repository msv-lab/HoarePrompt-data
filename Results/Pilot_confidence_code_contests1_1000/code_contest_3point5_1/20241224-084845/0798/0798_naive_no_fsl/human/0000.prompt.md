You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.

Recall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors — 1 and k. 

Input

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000).

Output

The first line of the output contains a single integer k — maximum possible number of primes in representation.

The second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.

import bisect

a = int(input(''))
arr = []
primes = func_1()
while a >= 0:
    position = bisect.bisect_left(primes, a)
    if primes[position] > a or (primes[position] == a and a not in [2, 3]):
        position -= 1
        if a - 1 == primes[position]:
            position -= 1
    arr.append(primes[position])
    a -= primes[position]
    if a == 0:
        break
print(len(arr))
print(' '.join([str(word) for word in arr]))

def func_1():
    primes = []
    values = [True for p in range(2, 10 ** 6 + 10)]
    p = 2
    while p <= 10 ** 6:
        if values[p] == True:
            primes.append(p)
            for m in range(p * 2, 10 ** 6, p):
                values[m] = False
        p += 1
    del values
    return primes


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
