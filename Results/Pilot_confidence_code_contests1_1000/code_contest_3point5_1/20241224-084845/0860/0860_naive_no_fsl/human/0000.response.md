Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the target mass cannot be achieved through the described process. Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
2
16
3
```

**Expected Output for `n=16`:**
```
4
1 2 4 8 
```

This is because:
- Day 1: 1 bacterium splits into 2 bacteria of mass 0.5 each.
- Night 1: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 2 bacteria of mass 1.5.
- Day 2: 2 bacteria split into 4 bacteria of mass 0.75 each.
- Night 2: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 4 bacteria of mass 1.75.
- Day 3: 4 bacteria split into 8 bacteria of mass 0.875 each.
- Night 3: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 8 bacteria of mass 1.875.
- Day 4: 8 bacteria split into 16 bacteria of mass 0.4375 each.
- Night 4: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 16 bacteria of mass 1.4375, which sums to 16.

However, the provided program does not generate this output. Instead, it seems to have a logic flaw where it does not properly account for the splitting and mass increase process to reach the exact target mass.

For **`n=3`**, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because it is possible to achieve a total mass of 3:

- Day 1: 1 bacterium splits into 2 bacteria of mass 0.5 each.
- Night 1: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 2 bacteria of mass 1.5.
- Day 2: 1 bacterium splits into 2 bacteria of mass 0.75 each.
- Night 2: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 2 bacteria of mass 1.75.
- Day 3: 1 bacterium splits into 2 bacteria of mass 0.875 each.
- Night 3: Mass increases by 1 for each, so we have 2 bacteria of mass 2.875, which sums to 3.

Since the program fails to handle these cases correctly, the overall correctness is **False**.
