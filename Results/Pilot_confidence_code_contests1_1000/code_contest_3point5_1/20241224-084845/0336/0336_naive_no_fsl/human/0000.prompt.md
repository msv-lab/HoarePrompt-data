You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a1, a2, ..., an of n integer numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:

  * Each pencil belongs to exactly one box; 
  * Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it; 
  * If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |ai - aj| ≤ d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |ai - aj| ≤ d and they belong to different boxes. 



Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print "YES" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print "NO".

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and d (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — saturation of color of each pencil.

Output

Print "YES" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise print "NO".

Examples

Input

6 3 10
7 2 7 7 4 2


Output

YES


Input

6 2 3
4 5 3 13 4 10


Output

YES


Input

3 2 5
10 16 22


Output

NO

Note

In the first example it is possible to distribute pencils into 2 boxes with 3 pencils in each with any distribution. And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.

In the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.
Program:
```
from bisect import bisect
from sys import exit

def func():
    [n, k, d] = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    ais = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split()))
    if k == 1:
        print('YES')
        exit()
    ais.sort()
    cando = [False for _ in range(n)]
    j = n - 1
    count = 0
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if i + k < n and cando[i + k]:
            count += 1
        if n - i < k:
            continue
        if ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d:
            cando[i] = True
            continue
        while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
            if cando[j]:
                count -= 1
            j -= 1
        cando[i] = count > 0
    if cando[0]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
