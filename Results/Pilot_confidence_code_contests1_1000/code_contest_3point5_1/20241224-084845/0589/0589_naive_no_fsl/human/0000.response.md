Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the edge case where no valid counterexample exists within the given range. Specifically, in the second example where the range is [10, 11], the program should output `-1` since no valid triplet (a, b, c) can be found. However, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly and will attempt to generate a solution, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if no valid triplet can be found and output `-1` in such cases.
