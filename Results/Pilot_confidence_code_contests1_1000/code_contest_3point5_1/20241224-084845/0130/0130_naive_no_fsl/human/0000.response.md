Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of wins `x` exceeds the total number of games `n`. Specifically, the program iterates over possible values of `i` (number of draws) up to `w`, which is not necessarily the correct upper limit. The correct upper limit for `i` should be `n`, as the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played.

To fix this issue, the loop should iterate from `0` to `n` instead of `0` to `w`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    [n, p, w, d] = [int(i) for i in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    x = -1
    y = -1
    z = -1
    done = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):  # Change the upper limit to n
        if (p - i * d) % w == 0:
            j = (p - i * d) // w
            if i + j <= n:
                (x, y, z) = (j, i, n - j - i)
                done = 1
                break
    if done == 1:
        print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y) + ' ' + str(z))
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

With this correction, the program will properly handle all potential cases according to the problem description.
