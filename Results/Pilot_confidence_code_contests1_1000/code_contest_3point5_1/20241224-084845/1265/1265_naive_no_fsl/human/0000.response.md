Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the trains pass each other exactly at a station. According to the problem description, if the trains pass each other just at a station, the smaller number of the section numbers on both sides should be output. However, the current implementation calculates the crossing point based on the cumulative lengths of the sections and the speeds of the trains. This approach does not account for the exact moment when the trains meet at a station boundary.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40,60
```

In this case, both trains start simultaneously and travel towards each other. They will pass each other exactly at the end of the second section, which is a station boundary. The correct output should be `2`, but the current program calculates the crossing point based on the average position and outputs `4`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the calculated crossing point falls exactly at a station boundary before outputting the section number.
