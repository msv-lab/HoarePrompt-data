You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a double-track line (up and down are separate lines and pass each other everywhere). There are 11 stations on this line, including the terminal station, and each station is called by the section number shown in the figure.

<image>


Trains depart from both terminal stations on this line at the same time and run without stopping along the way. Create a program that reads the length of each section and the speed of the two trains and outputs the number of the section where the trains pass each other in each case. However, if you pass each other just at the station, the smaller number of the section numbers on both sides will be output. In addition, the length of the train and the length of the station cannot be ignored.



Input

Multiple datasets are given. Each dataset is given in the following format.


l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, l6, l7, l8, l9, l10, v1, v2


li (1 ≤ li ≤ 2,000) is an integer representing the length (km) of the interval i. v1 is the speed of the train departing from the terminal station on the section 1 side (km / h), and v2 is the speed of the train departing from the terminal station on the section 10 side (km / h) (1 ≤ v1, v2) ≤ 2,000).

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Output

For each data set, the number of the section where the train passes is output on one line.

Example

Input

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40,60
1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,50,50
10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,50,49


Output

4

Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func():
    for line in stdin:
        L = [int(s) for s in line.split(',')]
        cross_over = L[10] * sum(L[:10]) / (L[10] + L[11])
        d = 0
        for (i, xi) in enumerate(L[:10]):
            d += xi
            if cross_over <= d:
                break
        print(i + 1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
