You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya became interested in bioinformatics. He's going to write an article about similar cyclic DNA sequences, so he invented a new method for determining the similarity of cyclic sequences.

Let's assume that strings s and t have the same length n, then the function h(s, t) is defined as the number of positions in which the respective symbols of s and t are the same. Function h(s, t) can be used to define the function of Vasya distance ρ(s, t): 

<image> where <image> is obtained from string s, by applying left circular shift i times. For example, ρ("AGC", "CGT") =  h("AGC", "CGT") + h("AGC", "GTC") + h("AGC", "TCG") +  h("GCA", "CGT") + h("GCA", "GTC") + h("GCA", "TCG") +  h("CAG", "CGT") + h("CAG", "GTC") + h("CAG", "TCG") =  1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 6

Vasya found a string s of length n on the Internet. Now he wants to count how many strings t there are such that the Vasya distance from the string s attains maximum possible value. Formally speaking, t must satisfy the equation: <image>.

Vasya could not try all possible strings to find an answer, so he needs your help. As the answer may be very large, count the number of such strings modulo 109 + 7.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line of the input contains a single string of length n, consisting of characters "ACGT".

Output

Print a single number — the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Examples

Input

1
C


Output

1


Input

2
AG


Output

4


Input

3
TTT


Output

1

Note

Please note that if for two distinct strings t1 and t2 values ρ(s, t1) и ρ(s, t2) are maximum among all possible t, then both strings must be taken into account in the answer even if one of them can be obtained by a circular shift of another one.

In the first sample, there is ρ("C", "C") = 1, for the remaining strings t of length 1 the value of ρ(s, t) is 0.

In the second sample, ρ("AG", "AG") = ρ("AG", "GA") = ρ("AG", "AA") = ρ("AG", "GG") = 4.

In the third sample, ρ("TTT", "TTT") = 27
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function, division
import sys

def func():
    it = iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines())
    n = int(next(it))
    s = next(it)
    m = set()
    for char in s:
        m.add(char)
    k = len(m)
    print(k ** n % (10 ** 9 + 7))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
