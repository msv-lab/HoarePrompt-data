Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `dfsUtil` method is used to find a cycle, but it does not ensure that the cycle has a length of at least \(k+1\). Instead, it performs a simple depth-first search (DFS) and prints the first cycle found, which may not meet the requirement of having at least \(k+1\) nodes.

To illustrate this, consider the following graph:

- Nodes: 4
- Edges: \((1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)\)
- \(k = 2\)

For this graph, a valid cycle of length at least \(k+1=3\) would be \([1, 2, 3]\) or \([1, 4, 3]\). However, the provided program will only find the cycle \([1, 2, 1]\) or \([4, 1, 4]\), which do not meet the requirement of having at least \(k+1\) nodes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
