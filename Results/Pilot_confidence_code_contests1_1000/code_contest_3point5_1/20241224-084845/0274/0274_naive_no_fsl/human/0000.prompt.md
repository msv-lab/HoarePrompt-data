You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got a undirected graph G, consisting of n nodes. We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to n. We know that each node of graph G is connected by edges with at least k other nodes of this graph. Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least k + 1.

A simple cycle of length d (d > 1) in graph G is a sequence of distinct graph nodes v1, v2, ..., vd such, that nodes v1 and vd are connected by an edge of the graph, also for any integer i (1 ≤ i < d) nodes vi and vi + 1 are connected by an edge of the graph.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, k (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 105; 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of the nodes of the graph, the number of the graph's edges and the lower limit on the degree of the graph node. Next m lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n; ai ≠ bi) — the indexes of the graph nodes that are connected by the i-th edge. 

It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any multiple edges or self-loops. It is guaranteed that each node of the graph is connected by the edges with at least k other nodes of the graph.

Output

In the first line print integer r (r ≥ k + 1) — the length of the found cycle. In the next line print r distinct integers v1, v2, ..., vr (1 ≤ vi ≤ n) — the found simple cycle.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
