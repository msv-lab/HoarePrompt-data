You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Joisino is planning to open a shop in a shopping street.

Each of the five weekdays is divided into two periods, the morning and the evening. For each of those ten periods, a shop must be either open during the whole period, or closed during the whole period. Naturally, a shop must be open during at least one of those periods.

There are already N stores in the street, numbered 1 through N.

You are given information of the business hours of those shops, F_{i,j,k}. If F_{i,j,k}=1, Shop i is open during Period k on Day j (this notation is explained below); if F_{i,j,k}=0, Shop i is closed during that period. Here, the days of the week are denoted as follows. Monday: Day 1, Tuesday: Day 2, Wednesday: Day 3, Thursday: Day 4, Friday: Day 5. Also, the morning is denoted as Period 1, and the afternoon is denoted as Period 2.

Let c_i be the number of periods during which both Shop i and Joisino's shop are open. Then, the profit of Joisino's shop will be P_{1,c_1}+P_{2,c_2}+...+P_{N,c_N}.

Find the maximum possible profit of Joisino's shop when she decides whether her shop is open during each period, making sure that it is open during at least one period.

Constraints

* 1≤N≤100
* 0≤F_{i,j,k}≤1
* For every integer i such that 1≤i≤N, there exists at least one pair (j,k) such that F_{i,j,k}=1.
* -10^7≤P_{i,j}≤10^7
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
F_{1,1,1} F_{1,1,2} ... F_{1,5,1} F_{1,5,2}
:
F_{N,1,1} F_{N,1,2} ... F_{N,5,1} F_{N,5,2}
P_{1,0} ... P_{1,10}
:
P_{N,0} ... P_{N,10}


Output

Print the maximum possible profit of Joisino's shop.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
