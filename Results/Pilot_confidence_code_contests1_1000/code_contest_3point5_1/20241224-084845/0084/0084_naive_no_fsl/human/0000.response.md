Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of periods during which both Joisino's shop and another shop are open. Specifically, the function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. 

The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of periods during which both Joisino's shop and another shop are open. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate this value. It simply counts the number of bits set in the binary representation of `ox & i`, which does not take into account the open periods of the other shop.

To fix this, `func_1` should compute the number of periods where both shops are open by using the bitwise AND operation and counting the number of set bits in the result. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    o = 0
    for i in range(10):
        b = 1 << i
        if n & b and i & n:  # Check if both bits are set
            o += 1
    return o
```

However, the main issue is that the program uses bitwise operations in a way that does not directly map to the problem constraints. A more straightforward approach would be to explicitly count the number of periods where both shops are open using nested loops or list comprehensions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

n = int(input().strip())
openL = [int(''.join(input().strip().split()), 2) for _ in range(n)]
profL = [[int(e) for e in input().strip().split()] for _ in range(n)]

maxP = -sys.maxsize - 1
for i in range(1, 1024):
    p = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if openL[x] & i:
            p += profL[x][func_1(openL[x] & i)]
    if p > maxP:
        maxP = p
print(maxP)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((n >> i) & 1 for i in range(10))  # Count the number of set bits in the last 10 bits
```

In this corrected version, the `func_1` function correctly counts the number of periods during which both shops are open. This ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum possible profit.
