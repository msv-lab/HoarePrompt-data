Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program uses `sk = list(set(arr))` to get unique elements from the sequence. This approach is problematic because it removes duplicates, which might not always lead to finding the correct solution. For example, consider the sequences `[2, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`. The program would fail to find a valid pair because it treats all 2s as the same.

2. **Sum Calculation and Comparison**: The program calculates the sum of the sequence and then tries to find a difference between the sum and each element. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the correct pair. It needs to consider all possible pairs of elements from different sequences directly.

3. **Exit Condition**: The program uses `exit(0)` after printing the result, which can cause issues in some environments or test cases where the expected behavior is different.

To fix these issues, the program needs to directly compare sums of elements from different sequences and ensure it handles all potential cases correctly. Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    sequences = []
    
    for _ in range(k):
        ni = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sequences.append((ni, arr))
    
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i + 1, k):
            for x in range(len(sequences[i][1])):
                seq_i_sum = sum(sequences[i][1][:x] + sequences[i][1][x+1:])
                for y in range(len(sequences[j][1])):
                    seq_j_sum = sum(sequences[j][1][:y] + sequences[j][1][y+1:])
                    if seq_i_sum == seq_j_sum:
                        print('YES')
                        print(f'{i + 1} {x + 1}')
                        print(f'{j + 1} {y + 1}')
                        return
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This revised program directly compares sums of elements from different sequences and ensures it handles all potential cases correctly.
