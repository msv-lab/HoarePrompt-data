Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of days with a bad price. Specifically, the program uses `raw_input()` and `input()` functions which are not standard in Python 3. Additionally, the logic to count bad prices is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `input()` which are not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` for both reading the number of days and the list of prices.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to count bad prices is incorrect. The program updates `minAr` only if the current price is less than `minAr`, but it should update `sm` (the count of bad prices) whenever the current price is greater than `minAr`.

A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
                minAr = l[j]
        print(sm)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `input()` for reading inputs and properly counts the number of days with a bad price.
