You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.

        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        print(sm)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
