Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the abbreviation starts with '0'. According to the problem description, if the abbreviation is 'IAO'0', it should represent the year 1990. However, the program incorrectly calculates the year for 'IAO'0' as follows:

1. `code_str` for 'IAO'0' is '0'.
2. `code_len` is 1.
3. `tmp` is calculated as `int('0' + '0')`, which is 0.
4. Since `0 < 1990`, `tmp` is adjusted by adding `power_of_10[0]`, which is 1, resulting in `tmp` being 1.
5. Therefore, the output for 'IAO'0' is 1991, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the abbreviation starts with '0' and handle it separately. Hereâ€™s a modified version of the `func_1` function to address this issue:

```python
def func_1(code_str):
    code_len = len(code_str)
    if code_str == '0':
        return 1990
    tmp = int(cut_off_str[code_len - 1] + code_str)
    if tmp < cut_off[code_len - 1]:
        tmp += power_of_10[code_len - 1]
    return tmp
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle the case where the abbreviation starts with '0'.
