Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting Indices**: For each test case, it sorts the indices of the digits based on their values, ensuring that digits with smaller values come before those with larger values.
3. **Coloring Logic**: It then tries to color the digits such that the sequence formed by digits colored 1 is non-decreasing, followed by digits colored 2. It ensures that once a digit is placed in color 1, subsequent digits in color 1 are not smaller, and similarly for color 2.
4. **Output**: If a valid coloring is found, it prints the coloring; otherwise, it prints '-' indicating no valid coloring exists.

The logic seems sound and covers all the constraints mentioned in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the provided code fails to handle based on the given problem description and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
