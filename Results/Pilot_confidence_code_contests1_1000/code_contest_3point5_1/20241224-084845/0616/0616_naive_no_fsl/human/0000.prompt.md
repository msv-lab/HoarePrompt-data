You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You are given an integer n. 

You have to find a sequence s consisting of digits \{1, 3, 7\} such that it has exactly n subsequences equal to 1337.

For example, sequence 337133377 has 6 subsequences equal to 1337: 

  1. 337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}7\underline{7} (you can remove the second and fifth characters); 
  2. 337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}7\underline{7} (you can remove the third and fifth characters); 
  3. 337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}37\underline{7} (you can remove the fourth and fifth characters); 
  4. 337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}\underline{7}7 (you can remove the second and sixth characters); 
  5. 337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}\underline{7}7 (you can remove the third and sixth characters); 
  6. 337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}3\underline{7}7 (you can remove the fourth and sixth characters). 



Note that the length of the sequence s must not exceed 10^5.

You have to answer t independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of queries. 

Next t lines contains a description of queries: the i-th line contains one integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

For the i-th query print one string s_i (1 ≤ |s_i| ≤ 10^5) consisting of digits \{1, 3, 7\}. String s_i must have exactly n_i subsequences 1337. If there are multiple such strings, print any of them.

Example

Input


2
6
1


Output


113337
1337
Program:
```
import fileinput

func_3()

def func_1(a):
    print(a)

def func_2(s, I):
    return int(s.split(' ')[I])

def func_3():
    z = 0
    C = 44850
    for l in fileinput.input():
        z += 1
        if z < 2:
            continue
        I = int(l)
        func_1('133' + I % C * '7' + 298 * '3' + I / C * '7')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
