You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya got string s for his birthday, the string consists of small English letters. He immediately added k more characters to the right of the string.

Then Borya came and said that the new string contained a tandem repeat of length l as a substring. How large could l be?

See notes for definition of a tandem repeat.

Input

The first line contains s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 200). This string contains only small English letters. The second line contains number k (1 ≤ k ≤ 200) — the number of the added characters.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum length of the tandem repeat that could have occurred in the new string.

Examples

Input

aaba
2


Output

6


Input

aaabbbb
2


Output

6


Input

abracadabra
10


Output

20

Note

A tandem repeat of length 2n is string s, where for any position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the following condition fulfills: si = si + n.

In the first sample Kolya could obtain a string aabaab, in the second — aaabbbbbb, in the third — abracadabrabracadabra.
Program:
```
import os

def func():
    a = str(raw_input())
    k = int(raw_input())
    la = len(a)
    i = la - 1
    judge = True
    if k >= la:
        judge = False
        print(la + k) / 2 * 2
    while i >= 0 and judge:
        if a[i:la] in a[0:i - k + 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            break
    if judge:
        print(la - i - 1 + k) / 2 * 2 * 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
