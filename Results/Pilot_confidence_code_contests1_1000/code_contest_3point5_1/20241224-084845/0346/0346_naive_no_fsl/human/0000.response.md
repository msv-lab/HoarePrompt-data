Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the lexicographically minimal lucky string for all input lengths \( n \). Specifically, the program generates a string using only the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' in a cyclic manner without considering the requirement that the string must be lucky. A lucky string, according to the problem description, should have the property that the absolute difference between any two adjacent positions of the same character is a lucky number (i.e., 4 or 7).

For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program outputs "abcda", which is not a lucky string because the difference between the positions of the first and last 'a' (which are 1 and 5) is 4, but the difference between the positions of the second and third 'a' (which are 2 and 4) is 2, which is not a lucky number.

A correct solution would involve generating positions for each character such that the differences between adjacent positions are either 4 or 7. The provided program fails to achieve this.
