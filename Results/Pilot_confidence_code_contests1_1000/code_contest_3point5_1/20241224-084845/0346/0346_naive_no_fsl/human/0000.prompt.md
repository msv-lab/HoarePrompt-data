You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya recently learned to determine whether a string of lowercase Latin letters is lucky. For each individual letter all its positions in the string are written out in the increasing order. This results in 26 lists of numbers; some of them can be empty. A string is considered lucky if and only if in each list the absolute difference of any two adjacent numbers is a lucky number. 

For example, let's consider string "zbcdzefdzc". The lists of positions of equal letters are:

  * b: 2
  * c: 3, 10
  * d: 4, 8
  * e: 6
  * f: 7
  * z: 1, 5, 9
  * Lists of positions of letters a, g, h, ..., y are empty.



This string is lucky as all differences are lucky numbers. For letters z: 5 - 1 = 4, 9 - 5 = 4, for letters c: 10 - 3 = 7, for letters d: 8 - 4 = 4. 

Note that if some letter occurs only once in a string, it doesn't influence the string's luckiness after building the lists of positions of equal letters. The string where all the letters are distinct is considered lucky.

Find the lexicographically minimal lucky string whose length equals n.

Input

The single line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the length of the sought string.

Output

Print on the single line the lexicographically minimal lucky string whose length equals n.

Examples

Input

5


Output

abcda


Input

3


Output

abc

Note

The lexical comparison of strings is performed by the < operator in modern programming languages. String a is lexicographically less than string b if exists such i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), that ai < bi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) aj = bj.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    l = 'abcd'
    i = 0
    flag = 0
    while i < n:
        x = n / 4
        if n <= 4:
            x = 1
        if x == flag:
            break
        if i == n - 1:
            i = 0
            flag += 1
        sys.stdout.write(l[i])
        i += 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
