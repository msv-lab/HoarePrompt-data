Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when all elements in the sequence are identical. Specifically, consider the input:

```
2
5
5
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
5
5
```

However, the program will produce:

```
5
5
5
```

This is because the list `b` is initialized to contain zeros where the maximum element is found, and then it is incorrectly modified to replace those zeros with the maximum element again, leading to an extra instance of the maximum value being printed. This behavior violates the problem description for sequences where all elements are the same. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
