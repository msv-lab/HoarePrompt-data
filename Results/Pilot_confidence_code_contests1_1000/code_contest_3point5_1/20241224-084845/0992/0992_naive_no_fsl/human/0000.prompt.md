You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem is same as the next one, but has smaller constraints.

It was a Sunday morning when the three friends Selena, Shiro and Katie decided to have a trip to the nearby power station (do not try this at home). After arriving at the power station, the cats got impressed with a large power transmission system consisting of many chimneys, electric poles, and wires. Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.

At the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates (x_i, y_i). Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.

Selena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage. So he wonders, how many pairs are intersecting? Could you help him with this problem?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of electric poles.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (-10^4 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^4) — the coordinates of the poles.

It is guaranteed that all of these n points are distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of pairs of wires that are intersecting.

In the second example:

Note that the three poles (0, 0), (0, 2) and (0, 4) are connected by a single wire.

Program:
```
dire = {}
n = int(input())
l = []
for k in range(n):
    l.append(tuple(map(int, raw_input().split())))
for k in range(n):
    for i in l[k + 1:]:
        func_2(l[k], i)
dire = [len(dire[k]) for k in dire]
s = sum(dire)
print(sum(((s - k) * k for k in dire)) // 2)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return abs(a)

def func_2(a, b):
    (x0, y0) = a
    (x1, y1) = b
    dx = x1 - x0
    dy = y1 - y0
    d = func_1(dx, dy)
    dx //= d
    dy //= d
    if dy < 0:
        dy *= -1
        dx *= -1
    if dy == 0:
        dx = 1
    if dx == 0:
        dy = 1
    cl = (dx, dy)
    if dx:
        n1 = y0 * dx - dy * x0
        d1 = dx
        d = func_1(n1, d1)
        n1 //= d
        d1 //= d
        if d1 < 0:
            d1 *= -1
            n1 *= -1
        v = (n1, d1)
    else:
        v = x0
    if not cl in dire:
        dire[cl] = {v}
    else:
        dire[cl].add(v)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
