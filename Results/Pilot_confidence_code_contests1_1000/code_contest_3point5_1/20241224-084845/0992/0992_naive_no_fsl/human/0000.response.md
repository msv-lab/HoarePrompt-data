Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of intersecting wire pairs. Specifically, the program fails to handle vertical lines properly. In the third example, the input coordinates are `(-1, -1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(3, 1)`. According to the problem description, since no two poles lie on the same line, there should be no intersecting pairs, and thus the output should be `0`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0` for this case, but this does not necessarily mean the program is correct for all cases. 

Upon further inspection, the program's logic for determining intersections does not correctly handle vertical lines. For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```
In this case, the program should output `6` because there are 6 pairs of intersecting lines (each pair formed by one vertical and one horizontal line). However, the program fails to count these intersections correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is `False`.
