You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: AquaMoon has n friends. They stand in a row from left to right, and the i-th friend from the left wears a T-shirt with a number a_i written on it. Each friend has a direction (left or right). In the beginning, the direction of each friend is right.

AquaMoon can make some operations on friends. On each operation, AquaMoon can choose two adjacent friends and swap their positions. After each operation, the direction of both chosen friends will also be flipped: left to right and vice versa.

AquaMoon hopes that after some operations, the numbers written on the T-shirt of n friends in the row, read from left to right, become non-decreasing. Also she wants, that all friends will have a direction of right at the end. Please find if it is possible.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of Aquamoon's friends.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers, written on the T-shirts.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, if there exists a possible sequence of operations, print "YES" (without quotes); otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


3
4
4 3 2 5
4
3 3 2 2
5
1 2 3 5 4


Output


YES
YES
NO

Note

The possible list of operations in the first test case:

  1. Swap a_1 and a_2. The resulting sequence is 3, 4, 2, 5. The directions are: left, left, right, right. 
  2. Swap a_2 and a_3. The resulting sequence is 3, 2, 4, 5. The directions are: left, left, right, right. 
  3. Swap a_1 and a_2. The resulting sequence is 2, 3, 4, 5. The directions are: right, right, right, right. 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin,stdout

def func():
    for _ in range(int(stdin.readline())):
        n = int(stdin.readline())
        a = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
        b = sorted(a)
        c = [[0, 0] for i in range(100005)]
        for i in range(n):
            c[a[i]][i % 2] += 1
            c[b[i]][i % 2] -= 1
        check = True
        for i in range(n):
            if c[a[i]][0] == 0 and c[a[i]][1] == 0:
                check = False
            else:
                check = True
                break
        if not check:
            stdout.write('YES\n')
        else:
            stdout.write('NO\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
