Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that all friends should have a direction of right at the end. Specifically, the program does not check if the parity of the number of swaps required to sort the array matches the initial parity of the friends' directions. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
4 3 2 5
```

The sorted array is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program checks if it's possible to rearrange the array such that all elements are in non-decreasing order and all friends end up facing right. However, the program does not ensure that the number of swaps performed will result in all friends facing right at the end. 

In this case, the program will output "YES" because it incorrectly assumes that sorting the array will automatically make all friends face right. But actually, since the initial direction of each friend is right, and each swap changes the direction of both friends, the total number of swaps needed must be even for all friends to end up facing right. 

Since the program does not account for this parity check, it is incorrect.
