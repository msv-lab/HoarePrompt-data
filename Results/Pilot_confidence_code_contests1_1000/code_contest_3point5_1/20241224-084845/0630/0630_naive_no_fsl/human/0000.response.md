Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the rules described for the "Berlogging" game. It processes the rounds, calculates the final scores for each player, identifies the maximum score, and then checks which player(s) reached at least the maximum score first. The logic handles all the cases described in the problem statement, including scenarios where multiple players tie for the maximum score. The program also ensures that initially, each player starts with 0 points, and it correctly outputs the first player who reaches the required score if there are ties for the maximum score. Given the examples provided and the constraints, the program appears to handle all necessary cases accurately.
