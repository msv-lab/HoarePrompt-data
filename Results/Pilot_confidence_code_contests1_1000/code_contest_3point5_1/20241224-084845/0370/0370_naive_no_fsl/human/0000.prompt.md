You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Alyona is celebrating Happy Birthday! Her mother has an array of n flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of i-th flower is ai. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.

Let's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.

For example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1, - 2, 1, 3, - 4. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1, - 2), (3, - 4), (1, 3), (1, - 2, 1, 3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: 

  * the first flower adds 1·1 = 1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, 
  * the second flower adds ( - 2)·1 = - 2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, 
  * the third flower adds 1·2 = 2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, 
  * the fourth flower adds 3·2 = 6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, 
  * the fifth flower adds ( - 4)·0 = 0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. 



Thus, in total 1 + ( - 2) + 2 + 6 + 0 = 7 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!

Alyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even 0 or all suggested by her mother.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother.

The second line contains the flowers moods — n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 100 ≤ ai ≤ 100).

The next m lines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother. The i-th of these lines contain two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n) denoting the subarray a[li], a[li + 1], ..., a[ri].

Each subarray can encounter more than once.

Output

Print single integer — the maximum possible value added to the Alyona's happiness.

Output

0

Note

The first example is the situation described in the statements.

In the second example Alyona should choose all subarrays.

The third example has answer 0 because Alyona can choose none of the subarrays.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, n) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ll = map(int, raw_input().split())
    sub = []
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        sub.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    result = 0
    for s in sub:
        tmp = ll[s[0] - 1:s[1]]
        a = sum(tmp)
        if a > 0:
            result += a
    print(result)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
