Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input reading and processing correctly. Specifically, the `argLines` list includes newline characters (`\n`) which are not necessary and should be removed. Additionally, the function `func_1()` reads from `sys.stdin`, but the input is provided as a string in the problem statement, not directly from standard input. This means the current implementation will not work as intended with the provided test cases.

To fix this, the `argLines` should be processed to remove newline characters, and the input should be read directly from the provided string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    argLines = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    
    for word in argLines:
        if len(word) > 10:
            print(func_2(word))
        else:
            print(word)

def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected according to the problem description.
