You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alex, Bob and Carl will soon participate in a team chess tournament. Since they are all in the same team, they have decided to practise really hard before the tournament. But it's a bit difficult for them because chess is a game for two players, not three.

So they play with each other according to following rules:

  * Alex and Bob play the first game, and Carl is spectating; 
  * When the game ends, the one who lost the game becomes the spectator in the next game, and the one who was spectating plays against the winner. 



Alex, Bob and Carl play in such a way that there are no draws.

Today they have played n games, and for each of these games they remember who was the winner. They decided to make up a log of games describing who won each game. But now they doubt if the information in the log is correct, and they want to know if the situation described in the log they made up was possible (that is, no game is won by someone who is spectating if Alex, Bob and Carl play according to the rules). Help them to check it!

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of games Alex, Bob and Carl played.

Then n lines follow, describing the game log. i-th line contains one integer ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 3) which is equal to 1 if Alex won i-th game, to 2 if Bob won i-th game and 3 if Carl won i-th game.

Output

Print YES if the situation described in the log was possible. Otherwise print NO.

Examples

Input

3
1
1
2


Output

YES


Input

2
1
2


Output

NO

Note

In the first example the possible situation is:

  1. Alex wins, Carl starts playing instead of Bob; 
  2. Alex wins, Bob replaces Carl; 
  3. Bob wins. 



The situation in the second example is impossible because Bob loses the first game, so he cannot win the second one.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = int(raw_input())
    p = [1, 2]
    np = 3
    ok = True
    for i in range(n):
        if np == nums[i]:
            ok = False
            break
        p.remove(nums[i])
        k = [nums[i], np]
        np = p[0]
        p = k
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
