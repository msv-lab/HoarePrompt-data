Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that Polycarp always chooses the optimal contest to maximize the number of training days. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
3 1 4 1
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program's logic does not guarantee that Polycarp will choose the contest with 4 problems on the third day. Instead, it simply increments the index `idx` until it finds a contest with at least the required number of problems for the current day. This means it might not always choose the optimal contest, leading to fewer training days than possible.

For instance, if we change the input to:
```
4
3 1 4 1
```

The program might incorrectly choose the contest with 3 problems on the first day, then the contest with 1 problem on the second day, and skip the contest with 4 problems because the next available contest (with 1 problem) does not meet the requirement for the third day. This results in only 2 training days instead of 3.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
