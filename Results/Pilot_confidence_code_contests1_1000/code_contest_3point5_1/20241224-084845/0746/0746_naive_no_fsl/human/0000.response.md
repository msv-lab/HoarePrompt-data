Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling the Case When \( n \) is Odd and \( k \) is Even**: The program handles this case by printing "NO" directly without attempting to check if a valid solution exists. For example, consider \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 4 \). Here, we can represent \( n \) as the sum of four odd numbers: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 \). However, the program incorrectly prints "NO".

2. **Handling the Case When \( n \) is Even and \( k \) is Odd with a Small \( k \)**: The program checks if \( k \times 2 \leq n \) before attempting to construct the solution. This approach fails for cases like \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 3 \). Here, we can represent \( n \) as the sum of three even numbers: \( 2 + 2 + 6 \). However, the program incorrectly prints "NO".

These issues show that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
