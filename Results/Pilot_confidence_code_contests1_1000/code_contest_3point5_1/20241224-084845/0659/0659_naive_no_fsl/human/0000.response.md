Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not actually solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` simply prints the inputs `9 * n` and `8 * n`, which are not necessarily composite numbers. The problem requires finding two composite numbers `a` and `b` such that `a - b = n`. However, `9 * n` and `8 * n` do not guarantee that both numbers will be composite for every value of `n`.

For example, consider `n = 1`:
- The program outputs `9 8`.
- However, 8 is composite, but 9 is also composite, which technically works in this specific case, but this approach does not cover all potential values of `n`.

To illustrate further, consider `n = 2`:
- The program would output `18 16`.
- Both 18 and 16 are composite, but this pattern does not hold for all `n`.

A correct implementation would involve checking if the generated numbers are composite before printing them. For instance, you could generate numbers starting from the smallest composite number and check if they meet the criteria.
