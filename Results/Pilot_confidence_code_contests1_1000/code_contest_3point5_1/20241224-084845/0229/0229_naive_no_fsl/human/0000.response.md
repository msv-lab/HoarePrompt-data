Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple products have the same `b_i` value but different `a_i` values correctly. Specifically, the logic for applying discounts and purchasing items does not account for the optimal sequence of purchases when multiple products have the same discount threshold.

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 4
2 4
1 5
```

Expected output:
- The optimal strategy would be to first buy one item of each product with a discount, and then use the discount to buy the remaining items.
- Lena can buy one item of each product (product 1, product 2, and product 3) for 2 rubles each, totaling 6 rubles.
- After that, she can buy the remaining items using the discount. She needs to buy one more item of product 1 and one more item of product 2, which will cost her 1 ruble each, totaling 2 rubles.
- Therefore, the total cost should be 8 rubles.

However, the provided program does not handle this scenario correctly and might produce a higher cost. This indicates that the program does not always find the minimum cost for all possible inputs, hence it is incorrect.
