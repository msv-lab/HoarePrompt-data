Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to restore the sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) from the given matrix \(b\). Hereâ€™s how the program works:

1. It reads the size \(n\) of the matrix.
2. For each row, it initializes a variable `y` to 0.
3. It iterates through each element in the row, performing a bitwise OR operation with `y` whenever the element is not -1. This effectively accumulates the unique bits that must be present in the corresponding \(a_i\) value.
4. It appends the result to the list `a`.
5. Finally, it prints the restored sequence of integers.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the "bitwise AND" operation, this approach ensures that each \(a_i\) is composed of the bits that appear in any \(b_{ij}\) where \(i \neq j\). Since it handles all elements of the matrix and ensures that the resulting values do not exceed \(10^9\), the program should work for all valid inputs.

There does not seem to be any edge case or potential input where this program would fail, making the correctness **True**.
