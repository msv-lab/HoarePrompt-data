You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Polycarpus has learned the "bitwise AND" operation (which is also called "AND") of non-negative integers. Now he wants to demonstrate the school IT teacher his superb manipulation with the learned operation.

For that Polycarpus came to school a little earlier and wrote on the board a sequence of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. He also wrote a square matrix b of size n × n. The element of matrix b that sits in the i-th row in the j-th column (we'll denote it as bij) equals:

  * the "bitwise AND" of numbers ai and aj (that is, bij = ai & aj), if i ≠ j; 
  * -1, if i = j. 



Having written out matrix b, Polycarpus got very happy and wiped a off the blackboard. But the thing is, the teacher will want this sequence to check whether Polycarpus' calculations were correct. Polycarus urgently needs to restore the removed sequence of integers, or else he won't prove that he can count correctly.

Help Polycarpus, given matrix b, restore the sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, that he has removed from the board. Polycarpus doesn't like large numbers, so any number in the restored sequence mustn't exceed 109.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of square matrix b. Next n lines contain matrix b. The i-th of these lines contains n space-separated integers: the j-th number represents the element of matrix bij. It is guaranteed, that for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the following condition fulfills: bii = -1. It is guaranteed that for all i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n; i ≠ j) the following condition fulfills: 0 ≤ bij ≤ 109, bij = bji.

Output

Print n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the sequence that Polycarpus wiped off the board. Separate the numbers by whitespaces. 

It is guaranteed that there is sequence a that satisfies the problem conditions. If there are multiple such sequences, you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

1
-1


Output

0 

Input

3
-1 18 0
18 -1 0
0 0 -1


Output

18 18 0 

Input

4
-1 128 128 128
128 -1 148 160
128 148 -1 128
128 160 128 -1


Output

128 180 148 160 

Note

If you do not know what is the "bitwise AND" operation please read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        y = 0
        for x in map(int, raw_input().split()):
            y |= x if x != -1 else 0
        a.append(y)
    print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
