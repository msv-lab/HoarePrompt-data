Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to compare \(x^y\) with \(y^x\). The function `func_1` is not relevant to the comparison and is incorrectly attempting to count the number of times `base` can be halved, which is unrelated to the exponential comparison.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
from sys import stdin

(x, y) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

# Compare x^y with y^x without calculating large numbers directly
if x == y:
    print('=')
elif x * math.log(y) < y * math.log(x):
    print('<')
else:
    print('>')
```

Explanation:
- The function uses logarithms to compare \(x^y\) and \(y^x\) without directly computing the large numbers.
- If \(x \cdot \log(y) < y \cdot \log(x)\), then \(x^y < y^x\).
- If \(x \cdot \log(y) > y \cdot \log(x)\), then \(x^y > y^x\).
- If \(x \cdot \log(y) = y \cdot \log(x)\), then \(x^y = y^x\).

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
