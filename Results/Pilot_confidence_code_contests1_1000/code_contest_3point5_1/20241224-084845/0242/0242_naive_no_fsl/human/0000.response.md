Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both `a` and `b` are greater than `c`. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it only checks if `c` is divisible by `a` or `b`, which is insufficient.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
3 5 8
```

According to the problem description, Dante should be able to deal exactly 8 damage using 2 shots from Ebony and 1 shot from Ivory (2 * 3 + 1 * 5 = 8). However, the current implementation does not account for this possibility and will incorrectly print "No".

A corrected version of the program should include a loop that iterates through all possible combinations of shots from Ebony and Ivory until the exact damage `c` is achieved or determined to be impossible. Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(c // a + 1):
        for j in range(c // b + 1):
            if i * a + j * b == c:
                print('Yes')
                return
    print('No')
```

This corrected version will correctly handle all cases and determine whether Dante can deal exactly `c` damage.
