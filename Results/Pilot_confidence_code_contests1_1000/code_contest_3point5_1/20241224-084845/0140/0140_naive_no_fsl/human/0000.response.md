Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a strictly increasing or decreasing order but has more than three elements. For such cases, the program incorrectly prints `-1` instead of identifying a valid pair of positions to swap.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program should identify that swapping any two elements will make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly and prints `-1`. Specifically, the function `func_3` checks for specific conditions but fails to generalize for all cases where the array can be made unsorted by swapping two elements.
