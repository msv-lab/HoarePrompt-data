You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's call some square matrix with integer values in its cells palindromic if it doesn't change after the order of rows is reversed and it doesn't change after the order of columns is reversed.

For example, the following matrices are palindromic:

<image>

The following matrices are not palindromic because they change after the order of rows is reversed:

<image>

The following matrices are not palindromic because they change after the order of columns is reversed:

<image>

You are given n^2 integers. Put them into a matrix of n rows and n columns so that each number is used exactly once, each cell contains exactly one number and the resulting matrix is palindromic. If there are multiple answers, print any. If there is no solution, print "NO".

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

The second line contains n^2 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n^2} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) — the numbers to put into a matrix of n rows and n columns.

Output

If it is possible to put all of the n^2 numbers into a matrix of n rows and n columns so that each number is used exactly once, each cell contains exactly one number and the resulting matrix is palindromic, then print "YES". Then print n lines with n space-separated numbers — the resulting matrix.

If it's impossible to construct any matrix, then print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
