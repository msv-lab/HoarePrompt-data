Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of roads connected to each city. It initializes a list `count` to store the number of roads for each city, then iterates through the input roads, incrementing the count for both cities involved in each road. Finally, it prints the count for each city. Given the constraints and the problem description, this implementation handles all cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases.
