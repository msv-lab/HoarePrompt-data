Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, for certain angles, the program may produce incorrect results. Let's consider the angle `178` as an example:

- For an angle of `178`, the correct minimal n-gon should be `180`, but the program outputs `360` instead.

Let's analyze why this happens:
- The program calculates `i = func_1(180, s)`, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `180` and the input angle `s`.
- For `s = 178`, `i = 2`.
- Then, `k = s / i = 178 / 2 = 89`.
- Next, `n = 180 / i = 180 / 2 = 90`.
- Finally, since `n <= k + 2` is false (`90 <= 89 + 2` is false), the program does not adjust `n` and prints `90`.

However, the correct minimal n-gon for `178` is actually `180`, because:
- In a regular 180-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360 / 180 = 2` degrees.
- Therefore, an angle of `178` can be formed by skipping 89 vertices (since `178` degrees is `89 * 2` degrees).

This example demonstrates that the program does not handle the case where the calculated `n` needs to be adjusted properly, leading to incorrect results for some angles. Hence, the program is incorrect.
