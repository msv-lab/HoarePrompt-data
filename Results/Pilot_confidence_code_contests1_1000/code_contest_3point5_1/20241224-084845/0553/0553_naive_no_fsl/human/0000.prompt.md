You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya learned a new programming language CALPAS. A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.

In the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.

Petya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of lines.

Next n lines contain commands. A command consists of a character that represents the operation ("&", "|" or "^" for AND, OR or XOR respectively), and the constant xi 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1023.

Output

Output an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the length of your program.

Next k lines must contain commands in the same format as in the input.

Examples

Input

3
| 3
^ 2
| 1


Output

2
| 3
^ 2


Input

3
&amp; 1
&amp; 3
&amp; 5


Output

1
&amp; 1


Input

3
^ 1
^ 2
^ 3


Output

0

Note

You can read about bitwise operations in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation>.

Second sample:

Let x be an input of the Petya's program. It's output is ((x&1)&3)&5 = x&(1&3&5) = x&1. So these two programs always give the same outputs.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    (z, o) = (0, 1023)
    for _ in xrange(n):
        (op, num) = raw_input().split()
        num = int(num)
        (z, o) = (eval('{0} {1} {2}'.format(z, op, num)), eval('{0} {1} {2}'.format(o, op, num)))
    (n2, n3, n4) = (0, 0, 1023)
    for i in xrange(10):
        x = 1 << i
        q = z & x
        w = o & x
        if q and (not w) == 0:
            n2 |= x
        elif q and w:
            n3 |= x
        elif not q and (not w):
            n4 &= ~x
    print(3)
    print('^ ' + str(n2))
    print('| ' + str(n3))
    print('& ' + str(n4))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
