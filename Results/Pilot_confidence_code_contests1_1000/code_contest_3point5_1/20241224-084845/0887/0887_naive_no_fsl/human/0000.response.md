Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to finding positions where the white token can be initially placed such that the black player wins. However, this solution does not align with the original problem's requirements.

The original problem requires determining the number of initial positions for the white token such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins. The program does not correctly handle the conditions for the white token's movement relative to the black tokens and does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

In this example, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The correct solution should output `2` because the white token can only be initially placed in two positions (1, 1) and (-1, -1) to ensure the black player can always force a win.

The program fails to accurately model the strategic aspects of the game and does not properly account for the constraints and optimal strategies described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is thus incorrect.
