Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it processes the input characters. Specifically, the line `f = -4 - x` is incorrect because it attempts to set the sign of the next number incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results for most inputs. For example, consider the input `2+2`:

- The program should evaluate `2 + 2` to get `4`.
- However, due to the bug, it incorrectly processes the input and outputs `-46`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly evaluate arithmetic expressions, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
