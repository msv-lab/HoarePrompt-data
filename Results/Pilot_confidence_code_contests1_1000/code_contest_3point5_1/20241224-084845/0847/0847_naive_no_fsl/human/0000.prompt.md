You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let’s play a stone removing game.

Initially, n stones are arranged on a circle and numbered 1, ... , n clockwise (Figure 1). You are also given two numbers k and m. From this state, remove stones one by one following the rules explained below, until only one remains. In step 1, remove stone m. In step 2, locate the k-th next stone clockwise from m and remove it. In subsequent steps, start from the slot of the stone removed in the last step, make k hops clockwise on the remaining stones and remove the one you reach. In other words, skip (k - 1) remaining stones clockwise and remove the next one. Repeat this until only one stone is left and answer its number.

For example, the answer for the case n = 8, k = 5, m = 3 is 1, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: An example game

Initial state: Eight stones are arranged on a circle.

Step 1: Stone 3 is removed since m = 3.

Step 2: You start from the slot that was occupied by stone 3. You skip four stones 4, 5, 6 and 7 (since k = 5), and remove the next one, which is 8.

Step 3: You skip stones 1, 2, 4 and 5, and thus remove 6. Note that you only count stones that are still on the circle and ignore those already removed. Stone 3 is ignored in this case.

Steps 4-7: You continue until only one stone is left. Notice that in later steps when only a few stones remain, the same stone may be skipped multiple times. For example, stones 1 and 4 are skipped twice in step 7.

Final State: Finally, only one stone, 1, is on the circle. This is the final state, so the answer is 1.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets each of which is formatted as follows.


n k m


The last dataset is followed by a line containing three zeros. Numbers in a line are separated by a single space. A dataset satisfies the following conditions.

2 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ m ≤ n

The number of datasets is less than 100.

Output

For each dataset, output a line containing the stone number left in the final state. No extra characters such as spaces should appear in the output.

import itertools as it
from collections import deque

def func():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10000000)
    while True:
        (n, k, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if n == 0:
            break
        pos = 0
        for num in range(1, n):
            pos += k
            pos %= num
        ans = (m + pos) % n + 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
