You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

You have to direct its edges in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain any paths of length two or greater (where the length of path is denoted as the number of traversed edges).

Input

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

The following m lines contain edges: edge i is given as a pair of vertices u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i). There are no multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair (u_i, v_i) there are no other pairs (u_i, v_i) and (v_i, u_i) in the list of edges. It is also guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertex in the given graph).

Output

If it is impossible to direct edges of the given graph in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain paths of length at least two, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line, and then print any suitable orientation of edges: a binary string (the string consisting only of '0' and '1') of length m. The i-th element of this string should be '0' if the i-th edge of the graph should be directed from u_i to v_i, and '1' otherwise. Edges are numbered in the order they are given in the input.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
