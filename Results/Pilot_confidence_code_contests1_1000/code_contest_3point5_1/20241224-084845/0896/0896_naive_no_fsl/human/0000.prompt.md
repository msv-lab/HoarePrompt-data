You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You survived several months of exam wars and were able to enter ICPC University on a sunny day. On the day of admission, there was an enthusiastic recruitment of circles on the campus of the university, and you received a large number of pamphlets and returned. When you return to your room, you find one of the pamphlets you received that interests you. The pamphlet was given by the university's public relations department.

The following problems were described in the pamphlet.

> How many combinations of two or more consecutive positive integers have a sum of N? For example, 9 has two combinations, 2 + 3 + 4 and 4 + 5.

If you were curious about the answer to this question, you decided to write a program to find out the answer. Therefore, your job is to write a program that outputs the answer to the problem for the positive integer N given as the input.



Input

The input is a sequence of datasets. Each dataset is a line of one integer N. Where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

The end of the input is indicated by a single line of zeros.

Output

The output is the order of the input datasets, which is the answer to the question for the positive integers represented by each dataset of the inputs. No other characters should be in the output.

Example

Input

9
500
0


Output

2
3
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    if sys.version_info[0] >= 3:
        raw_input = input
    try:
        while True:
            n = int(raw_input())
            if n == 0:
                break
            r = 0
            i = 1
            while 1:
                n -= i
                if n < 0:
                    break
                i += 1
                if n % i == 0:
                    r += 1
            print(r)
    except EOFError:
        pass


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
