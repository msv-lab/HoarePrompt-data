Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where watchmen are located at the same position (i.e., both x and y coordinates are the same). In such cases, the program incorrectly subtracts pairs from the count, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 1
1 1
1 1
```

The correct output should be 3, as there are three pairs of watchmen with the same coordinates. However, the program would output 0 because it incorrectly subtracts the pairs when calculating the final answer.

To fix this, the program needs to separately count the number of watchmen at each position and then use this count to calculate the number of pairs correctly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    positions = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        pos = (x, y)
        if pos in positions:
            positions[pos] += 1
        else:
            positions[pos] = 1
    
    ans = 0
    for pos, count in positions.items():
        if count > 1:
            # Calculate the number of pairs among watchmen at the same position
            ans += count * (count - 1) // 2
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the case where watchmen are at the same position and calculates the number of pairs accurately.
