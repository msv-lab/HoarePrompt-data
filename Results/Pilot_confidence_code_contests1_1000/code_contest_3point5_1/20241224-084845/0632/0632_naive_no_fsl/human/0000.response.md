Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to make the tree balanced by removing the minimum number of apples. Specifically, the function `func_9` does not correctly calculate the least common multiple (LCM) and the maximum value required to balance the subtrees.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example Input:
```
6
0 0 12 13 5 6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
```

### Expected Output:
```
6
```

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the array `ar` and reads the input values. However, the initialization of `ar` seems incorrect as it does not properly set up the structure needed to represent the tree.
2. **Tree Construction**: The tree construction part (`func_8`) seems incomplete and does not fully set up the structure of the tree.
3. **LCM Calculation**: The function `func_9` attempts to calculate the LCM and the maximum value needed to balance the subtrees. However, the logic is flawed:
   - The LCM calculation is done for all subtrees but does not ensure that the tree is balanced.
   - The `max` value calculation is not correctly aligned with the requirement to balance the tree by removing the minimum number of apples.

Given the example input, the program does not correctly identify that removing 6 apples (from the leaf with 12 apples) would balance the tree. Instead, it likely produces incorrect results due to the flawed implementation of the balancing logic.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is thus **incorrect**.
