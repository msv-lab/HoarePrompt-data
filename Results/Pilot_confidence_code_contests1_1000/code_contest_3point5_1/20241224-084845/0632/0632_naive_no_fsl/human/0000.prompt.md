You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. In each leaf vertex there's a single integer — the number of apples in this vertex. 

The weight of a subtree is the sum of all numbers in this subtree leaves. For instance, the weight of a subtree that corresponds to some leaf is the number written in the leaf.

A tree is balanced if for every vertex v of the tree all its subtrees, corresponding to the children of vertex v, are of equal weight. 

Count the minimum number of apples that you need to remove from the tree (specifically, from some of its leaves) in order to make the tree balanced. Notice that you can always achieve the goal by just removing all apples.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 108), ai is the number of apples in the vertex number i. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is guaranteed to be zero. 

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the tree edges. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) — the vertices connected by an edge. 

The vertices are indexed from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the sin, cout streams cin, cout or the %I64d specifier.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
