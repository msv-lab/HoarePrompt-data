You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Limak is a little polar bear. He loves connecting with other bears via social networks. He has n friends and his relation with the i-th of them is described by a unique integer ti. The bigger this value is, the better the friendship is. No two friends have the same value ti.

Spring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in. All his friends still sleep and thus none of them is online. Some (maybe all) of them will appear online in the next hours, one at a time.

The system displays friends who are online. On the screen there is space to display at most k friends. If there are more than k friends online then the system displays only k best of them — those with biggest ti.

Your task is to handle queries of two types:

  * "1 id" — Friend id becomes online. It's guaranteed that he wasn't online before. 
  * "2 id" — Check whether friend id is displayed by the system. Print "YES" or "NO" in a separate line. 



Are you able to help Limak and answer all queries of the second type?

Input

The first line contains three integers n, k and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 150 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(6, n)) — the number of friends, the maximum number of displayed online friends and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 109) where ti describes how good is Limak's relation with the i-th friend.

The i-th of the following q lines contains two integers typei and idi (1 ≤ typei ≤ 2, 1 ≤ idi ≤ n) — the i-th query. If typei = 1 then a friend idi becomes online. If typei = 2 then you should check whether a friend idi is displayed.

It's guaranteed that no two queries of the first type will have the same idi becuase one friend can't become online twice. Also, it's guaranteed that at least one query will be of the second type (typei = 2) so the output won't be empty.

Output

For each query of the second type print one line with the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if the given friend is displayed and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first sample, Limak has 4 friends who all sleep initially. At first, the system displays nobody because nobody is online. There are the following 8 queries:

  1. "1 3" — Friend 3 becomes online. 
  2. "2 4" — We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print "NO". 
  3. "2 3" — We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print "YES". 
  4. "1 1" — Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3. 
  5. "1 2" — Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given k = 2 so only two friends can be displayed. Limak has worse relation with friend 1 than with other two online friends (t1 < t2, t3) so friend 1 won't be displayed 
  6. "2 1" — Print "NO". 
  7. "2 2" — Print "YES". 
  8. "2 3" — Print "YES". 
Program:
```
import sys

(n, k, q) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
frendly = [0] + list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
bearsout = set([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
tree = [0]
for i in range(q):
    (lab, b) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    if lab == 1:
        if len(tree) > k:
            if frendly[b] > frendly[tree[1]]:
                bearsout.discard(b)
                bearsout.add(tree[1])
                tree[1] = b
                func_2(1)
        else:
            tree.append(b)
            bearsout.discard(b)
            func_1(len(tree) - 1)
    elif b in bearsout:
        sys.stdout.write('NO' + '\n')
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('YES' + '\n')

def func_1(ind):
    global tree
    while ind != 1 and frendly[tree[ind]] < frendly[tree[ind // 2]]:
        (tree[ind], tree[ind // 2]) = (tree[ind // 2], tree[ind])
        ind //= 2

def func_2(ind):
    global tree
    while ind * 2 + 1 <= len(tree) - 1 and (frendly[tree[ind]] > frendly[tree[ind * 2]] or frendly[tree[ind]] > frendly[tree[ind * 2 + 1]]):
        if frendly[tree[ind * 2]] > frendly[tree[ind * 2 + 1]]:
            (tree[ind], tree[ind * 2 + 1]) = (tree[ind * 2 + 1], tree[ind])
            ind = ind * 2 + 1
        else:
            (tree[ind], tree[ind * 2]) = (tree[ind * 2], tree[ind])
            ind *= 2
    if ind * 2 <= len(tree) - 1 and frendly[tree[ind]] > frendly[tree[ind * 2]]:
        (tree[ind], tree[ind * 2]) = (tree[ind * 2], tree[ind])
        ind *= 2


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
