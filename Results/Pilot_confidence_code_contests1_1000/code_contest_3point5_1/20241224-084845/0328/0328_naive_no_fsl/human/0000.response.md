Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly maintain the priority queue to keep track of the top `k` friends who are online. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the case when the new friend added is better than the root of the current tree. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 8
300 950 500 200
1 3
2 4
2 3
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
2 3
```

- Initially, no friends are online.
- "1 3" - Friend 3 becomes online. Only friend 3 is displayed.
- "2 4" - Friend 4 is checked, but since it's not online, the answer is "NO".
- "2 3" - Friend 3 is checked and the answer is "YES" (correct).
- "1 1" - Friend 1 becomes online. The system should now display friends 1 and 3.
- "1 2" - Friend 2 becomes online. The system should now display friends 2 and 3 because friend 2 has a higher relation score than friend 1.
- "2 1" - Friend 1 should be checked. Since friend 1 is not displayed, the answer should be "NO", but the program incorrectly prints "YES".
- "2 2" - Friend 2 should be checked. Since friend 2 is displayed, the answer should be "YES" (correct).
- "2 3" - Friend 3 should be checked. Since friend 3 is displayed, the answer should be "YES" (correct).

The issue arises in the `func_2` function where the new friend is not correctly repositioned in the heap. The function should ensure that the new friend is placed in the correct position to maintain the max-heap property. This is necessary to ensure that the top `k` friends are always correctly displayed.
