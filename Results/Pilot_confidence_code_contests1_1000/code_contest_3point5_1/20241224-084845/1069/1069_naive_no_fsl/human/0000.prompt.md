You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Several days ago you bought a new house and now you are planning to start a renovation. Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.

Your house has n rooms. In the i-th room you can install at most c_i heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with k sections is equal to k^2 burles.

Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least sum_i sections in total in the i-th room. 

For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most c_i radiators with total number of sections not less than sum_i.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of rooms.

Each of the next n lines contains the description of some room. The i-th line contains two integers c_i and sum_i (1 ≤ c_i, sum_i ≤ 10^4) — the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the i-th room, respectively.

Output

For each room print one integer — the minimum possible cost to install at most c_i radiators with total number of sections not less than sum_i.

Example

Input


4
1 10000
10000 1
2 6
4 6


Output


100000000
1
18
10

Note

In the first room, you can install only one radiator, so it's optimal to use the radiator with sum_1 sections. The cost of the radiator is equal to (10^4)^2 = 10^8.

In the second room, you can install up to 10^4 radiators, but since you need only one section in total, it's optimal to buy one radiator with one section.

In the third room, there 7 variants to install radiators: [6, 0], [5, 1], [4, 2], [3, 3], [2, 4], [1, 5], [0, 6]. The optimal variant is [3, 3] and it costs 3^2+ 3^2 = 18.
Program:
```
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for i in xrange(input()):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        div1 = b / a + 1
        print(div1 * div1 * (b % a)) + (div1 - 1) * (div1 - 1) * (a - b % a)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
