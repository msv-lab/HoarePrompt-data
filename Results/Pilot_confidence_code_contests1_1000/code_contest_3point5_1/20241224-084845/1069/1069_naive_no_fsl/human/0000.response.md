Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the number of sections `b` is exactly divisible by the number of radiators `a`. In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the cost.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
2 4
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
4
3
```

- Actual Output from the Program:
```
9
3
```

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum cost for the first room. For the first room, the optimal solution is to use 2 radiators each with 2 sections, resulting in a total cost of \(2^2 + 2^2 = 4\). However, the program calculates the cost as \(3 \times 3 = 9\), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
