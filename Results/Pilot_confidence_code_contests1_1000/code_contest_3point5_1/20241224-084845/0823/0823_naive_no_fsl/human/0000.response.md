Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce the correct output when `a2` (the count of digit '7') is greater than `a1` (the count of digit '4'), and the counts of '47' and '74' are not balanced.

Consider the following input:
```
2 3 1 2
```

According to the problem description, we need to find a lucky number where:
- The count of '4' is 2.
- The count of '7' is 3.
- The count of '47' is 1.
- The count of '74' is 2.

The program attempts to construct the number by alternating between '4' and '7' and adding extra '4's and '7's as needed. However, it does not ensure that the counts of '47' and '74' are balanced properly, which leads to incorrect results in some cases.

In the given example, the program will attempt to construct the number but will not balance the counts correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
