Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly transforming the binary string `a` into `b` in all cases, particularly with the constraints and operations described.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Prefix Inversion and Reversal**: The program does not correctly handle the inversion and reversal of the selected prefix. Specifically, the logic for selecting and flipping the prefix is flawed. For example, consider the following test case:

   ```
   2
   01
   10
   ```

   The program should transform `01` to `10` using at most 3 operations. However, the current implementation may not achieve this correctly. Let's analyze the given transformation steps in the example:

   - The program suggests `1 2 1`, which means:
     1. Flip the entire string: `01` → `10`.
     2. Flip the prefix of length 2 (which is the entire string): `10` → `01`.
     3. Flip the prefix of length 1 (first character): `01` → `10`.

   While this sequence of operations achieves the desired transformation, it uses more operations than necessary. A simpler and correct approach would be to directly flip the entire string in one operation: `01` → `10`.

2. **Lack of Optimization**: The program does not optimize the number of operations needed. For instance, in the case where `a` and `b` differ only in the last bit, the optimal solution would be to flip the entire string in one operation. However, the current implementation might suggest multiple operations.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `a` and `b` are already equal, the program should return 0 operations, but the current implementation might still perform unnecessary operations.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Properly handle the inversion and reversal of the selected prefix.
- Optimize the number of operations needed.
- Handle edge cases appropriately.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
