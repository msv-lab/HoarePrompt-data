Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program logic does not accurately determine the maximum number of friends that can be invited such that no friend dislikes the number of people going to the sea.

In the provided solution, the program attempts to iterate through a range from `min_group` to `max_group` and uses a function `func_1` to check if the current number of people (`i + 1`) falls within the acceptable range for each friend. However, the program logic breaks out of the loop after finding the first valid number of people and subtracts 1 from the result, which is incorrect. The program should continue checking and ensure it finds the maximum number of friends that can be invited without breaking out prematurely.

For example, consider the second test case:
```
5
8 100001
7 100001
12 100001
8 100001
3 100001
```

The program will incorrectly output `0`, but the correct answer should be `0` since no number of friends (including yourself) can satisfy all conditions simultaneously.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the largest subset of friends whose ranges overlap sufficiently to allow inviting a certain number of people. This involves using a more sophisticated algorithm, such as interval merging or counting overlaps, rather than the current approach.
