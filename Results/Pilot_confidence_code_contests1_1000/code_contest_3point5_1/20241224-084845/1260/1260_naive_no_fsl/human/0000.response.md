Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the change when using only 1000-yen bills. Specifically, the program seems to be calculating the change needed to reach the next 1000-yen mark, rather than providing the actual change received after paying with the minimum number of 1000-yen bills.

For example, consider the input `3000`. According to the problem description, if we pay exactly 3000 yen, we should receive no change. However, the program calculates the difference to the next 1000-yen mark, which is `0 % 1000 = 0`, and then again `(1000 - 0) % 1000 = 1000`. This results in an output of `1000`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should directly compute the remainder when dividing the payment amount by 1000 and then subtract this from 1000 to get the correct change:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    change = (1000 - n % 1000) % 1000
    if change == 1000:
        change = 0
    print(change)
```

This corrected version will handle the case where the payment amount is already a multiple of 1000 by setting the change to 0, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.
