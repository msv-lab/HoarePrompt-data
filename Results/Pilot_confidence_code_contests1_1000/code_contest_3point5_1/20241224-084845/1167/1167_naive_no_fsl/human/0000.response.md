Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After analyzing the provided program, it appears to correctly handle the activation and deactivation of colliders based on the given problem description. The program uses a prime factorization approach to determine if there is a conflict with any currently active colliders. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Prime Factorization**: The function `func_2` correctly computes the prime factors of a given number.
2. **Activation Logic**:
   - When activating a collider (`+ i`), the program checks for conflicts with existing active colliders based on their prime factors.
   - If no conflicts are found, the collider is activated.
   - If a conflict is found, the program correctly prints "Conflict with j".
3. **Deactivation Logic**:
   - When deactivating a collider (`- i`), the program correctly checks if the collider is already off and handles this case appropriately.
   - If the collider is on, it is deactivated and the program prints "Success" unless the collider is already off.

Given these points, the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
