You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At a geometry lesson Bob learnt that a triangle is called right-angled if it is nondegenerate and one of its angles is right. Bob decided to draw such a triangle immediately: on a sheet of paper he drew three points with integer coordinates, and joined them with segments of straight lines, then he showed the triangle to Peter. Peter said that Bob's triangle is not right-angled, but is almost right-angled: the triangle itself is not right-angled, but it is possible to move one of the points exactly by distance 1 so, that all the coordinates remain integer, and the triangle become right-angled. Bob asks you to help him and find out if Peter tricks him. By the given coordinates of the triangle you should find out if it is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither of these.

Input

The first input line contains 6 space-separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 â€” coordinates of the triangle's vertices. All the coordinates are integer and don't exceed 100 in absolute value. It's guaranteed that the triangle is nondegenerate, i.e. its total area is not zero.

Output

If the given triangle is right-angled, output RIGHT, if it is almost right-angled, output ALMOST, and if it is neither of these, output NEITHER.

Examples

Input

0 0 2 0 0 1


Output

RIGHT


Input

2 3 4 5 6 6


Output

NEITHER


Input

-1 0 2 0 0 1


Output

ALMOST
Program:
```
l = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = func_2()
for i in range(6):
    for j in [1, -1]:
        l[i] += j
        if s == 0:
            s = 2 * func_2()
        l[i] -= j
print['NEITHER', 'RIGHT', 'ALMOST'][s]

def func_1(a, b):
    return (l[a] - l[b]) ** 2 + (l[a + 1] - l[b + 1]) ** 2

def func_2():
    a = func_1(0, 2)
    b = func_1(2, 4)
    c = func_1(4, 0)
    return a + b == c or b + c == a or c + a == b


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
