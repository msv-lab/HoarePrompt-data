Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` checks if the sum of the squares of the sides of the triangle forms a Pythagorean triple, which is necessary for determining if a triangle is right-angled. However, the logic in `func_2` is incomplete and does not account for the possibility of the triangle being almost right-angled after moving one point.

2. **Incomplete Implementation of `func_2`**: The function `func_2` only returns a boolean indicating whether the triangle is right-angled. It does not handle the case where the triangle becomes right-angled after moving one point. 

3. **Moving Point Logic**: The loop that moves each point by 1 unit and checks if the triangle becomes right-angled is implemented incorrectly. The variable `s` is not properly initialized, and the logic inside the loop is flawed. The variable `s` should be used to store the result of `func_2` after moving each point, but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(a, b):
    return (a[0] - b[0]) ** 2 + (a[1] - b[1]) ** 2

def is_right_angled(p1, p2, p3):
    a = func_1(p1, p2)
    b = func_1(p2, p3)
    c = func_1(p3, p1)
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    return math.isclose(sides[0] + sides[1], sides[2])

def check_almost_right_angled(p1, p2, p3):
    # Try moving each point by 1 unit and check if the triangle becomes right-angled
    for point in [p1, p2, p3]:
        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            new_point = (point[0] + dx, point[1] + dy)
            if is_right_angled(new_point, p2, p3) or is_right_angled(p1, new_point, p3) or is_right_angled(p1, p2, new_point):
                return True
    return False

p1 = (x1, y1)
p2 = (x2, y2)
p3 = (x3, y3)

if is_right_angled(p1, p2, p3):
    print("RIGHT")
elif check_almost_right_angled(p1, p2, p3):
    print("ALMOST")
else:
    print("NEITHER")
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether the triangle is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither.
