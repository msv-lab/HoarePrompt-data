Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in calculating the value of `result`. Specifically, the line `result += a * 10 ** i // b % 10` is incorrect. This line is attempting to extract the i-th digit from the division of `a` by `b`, but it does so in a way that doesn't correctly simulate the long division process needed to extract each digit.

For instance, consider the input `1 2 3`. The expected output should be `5` because `1/2 = 0.5`, and the digits are `5, 0, 0` when considering up to 3 decimal places. However, the current implementation will incorrectly compute the sum of the digits.

A correct approach would be to convert `a/b` to a string and sum the first `n` digits after the decimal point. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func():
    for line in stdin:
        (a, b, n) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
        # Convert the division result to a string and split into digits
        digits = str(a / b)[2:n+2]  # Get the first n+1 characters after the decimal point
        result = sum(int(digit) for digit in digits if digit.isdigit())
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the digits are correctly extracted and summed, thus meeting the problem description for all potential cases.
