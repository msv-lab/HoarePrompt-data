Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input string consists of only even or only odd digits. Specifically, consider the input `111`. According to the problem description, we should be able to swap adjacent digits with different parities to minimize the number. However, the program will not be able to produce a smaller number because it only handles appending even and odd digits in separate deques and then alternately picks from them. In the case of `111`, both deques will be empty after processing, and the program will return `111` without making any changes.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that if all digits are of the same parity, it should handle this case by sorting the digits and then forming the smallest possible number. This can be done by checking if all digits are even or all are odd and then sorting the digits accordingly.
