Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to count the number of inversions in the list of species, which is not relevant to the problem. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum number of replants required to ensure that all plants of the same species are grouped together in contiguous segments defined by borders.

The program reads the input and extracts the species numbers, but it then incorrectly counts the number of times a species number decreases as it iterates through the list. This does not give the correct count of the minimum number of replants needed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
2 1
1 2.0
1 3.100
```

The program outputs `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` (replant the first plant to the right of the last plant). However, the program does not handle this case correctly because it simply counts the number of inversions without considering the need to group species contiguously.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we are grouping the species correctly and counting the minimum number of replants needed to achieve this. The current implementation does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
