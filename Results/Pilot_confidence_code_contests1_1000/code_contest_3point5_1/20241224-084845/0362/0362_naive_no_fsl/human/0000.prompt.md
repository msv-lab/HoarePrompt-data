You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Emuskald is an avid horticulturist and owns the world's longest greenhouse — it is effectively infinite in length.

Over the years Emuskald has cultivated n plants in his greenhouse, of m different plant species numbered from 1 to m. His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line, with each plant occupying a single point on that line.

Emuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature, so he wants to arrange m - 1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into m sections numbered from 1 to m from left to right with each section housing a single species. He is free to place the borders, but in the end all of the i-th species plants must reside in i-th section from the left.

Of course, it is not always possible to place the borders in such way, so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants. He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse (at any real coordinate) with no plant already in it. Since replanting is a lot of stress for the plants, help Emuskald find the minimum number of plants he has to replant to be able to place the borders.

Input

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n ≥ m), the number of plants and the number of different species. Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated numbers: one integer number si (1 ≤ si ≤ m), and one real number xi (0 ≤ xi ≤ 109), the species and position of the i-th plant. Each xi will contain no more than 6 digits after the decimal point.

It is guaranteed that all xi are different; there is at least one plant of each species; the plants are given in order "from left to the right", that is in the ascending order of their xi coordinates (xi < xi + 1, 1 ≤ i < n).

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of plants to be replanted.

Examples

Input

3 2
2 1
1 2.0
1 3.100


Output

1


Input

3 3
1 5.0
2 5.5
3 6.0


Output

0


Input

6 3
1 14.284235
2 17.921382
1 20.328172
3 20.842331
1 25.790145
1 27.204125


Output

2

Note

In the first test case, Emuskald can replant the first plant to the right of the last plant, so the answer is 1.

In the second test case, the species are already in the correct order, so no replanting is needed.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    inp = [int(i.split(' ')[0]) for i in sys.stdin.read().strip().splitlines()[1:]]
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(inp) - 1):
        if inp[i] > inp[i + 1]:
            res += 1
    sys.stdout.write(str(res))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
