Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest prime divisor of `n` but does so inefficiently by iterating up to `n-1`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially for larger values of `n`.

For instance, consider the input `n = 9`. According to the problem description:
1. The smallest prime divisor of 9 is 3.
2. Subtract 3 from 9 to get 6.
3. The smallest prime divisor of 6 is 2.
4. Subtract 2 from 6 to get 4.
5. The smallest prime divisor of 4 is 2.
6. Subtract 2 from 4 to get 2.
7. The smallest prime divisor of 2 is 2.
8. Subtract 2 from 2 to get 0.

The algorithm should perform 4 subtractions in total.

However, the provided program will incorrectly handle this case. It will not correctly identify the smallest prime divisor and will not perform the required number of subtractions.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the smallest prime divisor and continue with the algorithm until `n` becomes 0. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
cont = 0

while n > 0:
    for d in range(2, n + 1):
        if n % d == 0:
            n -= d
            cont += 1
            break

print(cont)
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest prime divisor is found and subtracted correctly, and the process continues until `n` becomes 0.
