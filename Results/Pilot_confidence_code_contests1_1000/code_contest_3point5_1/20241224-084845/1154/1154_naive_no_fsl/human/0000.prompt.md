You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n houses along the road where Anya lives, each one is painted in one of k possible colors.

Anya likes walking along this road, but she doesn't like when two adjacent houses at the road have the same color. She wants to select a long segment of the road such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

Help Anya find the longest segment with this property.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of houses and the number of colors (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 000).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n — the colors of the houses along the road (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k).

Output

Output a single integer — the maximum number of houses on the road segment having no two adjacent houses of the same color.

Example

Input


8 3
1 2 3 3 2 1 2 2


Output


4

Note

In the example, the longest segment without neighboring houses of the same color is from the house 4 to the house 7. The colors of the houses are [3, 2, 1, 2] and its length is 4 houses.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    max_sum = 1
    summ = 1
    for i in xrange(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            summ += 1
            if max_sum < summ:
                max_sum = summ
        else:
            summ = 1
    print(max_sum)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
