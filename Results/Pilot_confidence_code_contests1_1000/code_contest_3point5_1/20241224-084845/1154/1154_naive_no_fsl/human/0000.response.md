Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the sequence of house colors has multiple segments that meet the criteria (no two adjacent houses with the same color). Specifically, the program only considers the longest segment ending at the last house and does not account for longer segments that might exist within the sequence.

For example, consider the input:
```
9 3
1 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 3
```

The output of the given program would be `3`, but the correct answer should be `5` (the segment from house 4 to house 8, which has the colors [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]).

To fix this, the program needs to reset the `summ` variable and recompute `max_sum` whenever a new segment of different colored houses starts. Here's an updated version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_sum = 1
    current_sum = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            current_sum += 1
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
        else:
            current_sum = 1
    
    print(max_sum)

func()
```

This updated version ensures that the program correctly identifies the longest segment of houses with no two adjacent houses of the same color for any given input.
