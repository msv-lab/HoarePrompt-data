Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to have several issues that do not align with the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to use a segment tree to count the number of good pairs, but the logic and implementation do not correctly address the problem requirements.

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `func_1` to read inputs, but it is not defined in the given code snippet. This function is supposed to read either integers or floats based on the parameter `n`, but it is unclear how this function is implemented or used.

2. **Segment Tree Usage**: The segment tree is used to query and update values, but the way the segment tree is constructed and updated does not match the problem's requirements. The segment tree should ideally be used to count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `a_i + a_j > b_i + b_j`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Good Pairs**: The logic for determining good pairs is flawed. The program attempts to use a dictionary `mem` to store the differences between `a_i` and `b_i`, but it does not correctly handle the counting of pairs. The segment tree queries and updates are also misused.

4. **Potential Case Not Handled**: Consider the case where `a_i` and `b_i` are such that there are no good pairs. The program should output `0` in such cases, but the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario due to the misused segment tree.

Given these issues, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
