Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to ensure that no person in front of the current person is taller. It calculates the minimum total height of the stools needed by maintaining a running maximum height (`max_`) and adding the difference between `max_` and the current person's height (`a[i]`) to the answer if `max_` is greater than `a[i]`. This ensures that each person's height plus their stool height is at least as tall as all previous persons. Given the constraints and the logic, the program appears to handle all cases correctly without any edge cases being missed.
