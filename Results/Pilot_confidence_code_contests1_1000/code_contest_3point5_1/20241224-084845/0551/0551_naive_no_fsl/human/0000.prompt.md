You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you have noticed, there are lovely girls in Arpa’s land.

People in Arpa's land are numbered from 1 to n. Everyone has exactly one crush, i-th person's crush is person with the number crushi.

<image>

Someday Arpa shouted Owf loudly from the top of the palace and a funny game started in Arpa's land. The rules are as follows.

The game consists of rounds. Assume person x wants to start a round, he calls crushx and says: "Oww...wwf" (the letter w is repeated t times) and cuts off the phone immediately. If t > 1 then crushx calls crushcrushx and says: "Oww...wwf" (the letter w is repeated t - 1 times) and cuts off the phone immediately. The round continues until some person receives an "Owf" (t = 1). This person is called the Joon-Joon of the round. There can't be two rounds at the same time.

Mehrdad has an evil plan to make the game more funny, he wants to find smallest t (t ≥ 1) such that for each person x, if x starts some round and y becomes the Joon-Joon of the round, then by starting from y, x would become the Joon-Joon of the round. Find such t for Mehrdad if it's possible.

Some strange fact in Arpa's land is that someone can be himself's crush (i.e. crushi = i).

Input

The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of people in Arpa's land.

The second line contains n integers, i-th of them is crushi (1 ≤ crushi ≤ n) — the number of i-th person's crush.

Output

If there is no t satisfying the condition, print -1. Otherwise print such smallest t.

Examples

Input

4
2 3 1 4


Output

3


Input

4
4 4 4 4


Output

-1


Input

4
2 1 4 3


Output

1

Note

In the first sample suppose t = 3. 

If the first person starts some round:

The first person calls the second person and says "Owwwf", then the second person calls the third person and says "Owwf", then the third person calls the first person and says "Owf", so the first person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied if x is 1.

The process is similar for the second and the third person.

If the fourth person starts some round:

The fourth person calls himself and says "Owwwf", then he calls himself again and says "Owwf", then he calls himself for another time and says "Owf", so the fourth person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied when x is 4.

In the last example if the first person starts a round, then the second person becomes the Joon-Joon, and vice versa.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = [0] + map(int, raw_input().split())
    b = [a[a[x]] for x in range(n + 1)]
    t = 200
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        if a[x] != x:
            u = x
            v = [0] * 111
            z = 0
            while not v[u]:
                v[u] = 1
                u = b[u]
                z += 1
            if u == x:
                t = min(t, z)
    print - 1 if t > 100 else t


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
