Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the crushes form cycles that are not of length 1. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
4
2 1 4 3
```

For this input, the crushes form a cycle of length 2: 2 -> 1 and 1 -> 2, and similarly for 3 -> 4 and 4 -> 3. The program incorrectly sets `t` to 1, which is not the smallest value that satisfies the condition for all starting points. 

To illustrate, if the first person (person 1) starts the round, they call the second person (person 2), who then calls the first person (person 1), making the first person the Joon-Joon. However, if the fourth person starts the round, they call the third person (person 3), who then calls the fourth person (person 4), making the fourth person the Joon-Joon. The smallest `t` that works for both cases is 1, but the program does not correctly identify this due to the cycle detection logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case and other similar cases involving cycles of length greater than 1.
