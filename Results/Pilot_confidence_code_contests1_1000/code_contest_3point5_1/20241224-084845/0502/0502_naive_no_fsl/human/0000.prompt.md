You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bash has set out on a journey to become the greatest Pokemon master. To get his first Pokemon, he went to Professor Zulu's Lab. Since Bash is Professor Zulu's favourite student, Zulu allows him to take as many Pokemon from his lab as he pleases.

But Zulu warns him that a group of k > 1 Pokemon with strengths {s1, s2, s3, ..., sk} tend to fight among each other if gcd(s1, s2, s3, ..., sk) = 1 (see notes for gcd definition).

Bash, being smart, does not want his Pokemon to fight among each other. However, he also wants to maximize the number of Pokemon he takes from the lab. Can you help Bash find out the maximum number of Pokemon he can take? 

Note: A Pokemon cannot fight with itself.

Input

The input consists of two lines.

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of Pokemon in the lab.

The next line contains n space separated integers, where the i-th of them denotes si (1 ≤ si ≤ 105), the strength of the i-th Pokemon.

Output

Print single integer — the maximum number of Pokemons Bash can take.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 4


Output

2


Input

5
2 3 4 6 7


Output

3

Note

gcd (greatest common divisor) of positive integers set {a1, a2, ..., an} is the maximum positive integer that divides all the integers {a1, a2, ..., an}.

In the first sample, we can take Pokemons with strengths {2, 4} since gcd(2, 4) = 2.

In the second sample, we can take Pokemons with strengths {2, 4, 6}, and there is no larger group with gcd ≠ 1.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import Counter

(n, a) = (int(input()), Counter([int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]))
func_1(10 ** 5 + 1)

def func_1(n):
    (prim, ans) = ([0] * (n + 1), 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if not prim[i]:
            prim[i] = a[i]
            for j in range(i << 1, n, i):
                prim[j] = i
                prim[i] += a[j]
            ans = max(ans, prim[i])
    print(max(ans, 1))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
