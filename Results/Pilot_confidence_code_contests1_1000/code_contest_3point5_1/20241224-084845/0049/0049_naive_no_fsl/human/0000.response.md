Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to identify certain scenarios where reversing a substring can result in a lexicographically smaller string. 

Consider the input `s = "abacaba"`. The program correctly identifies that reversing the substring from index 1 to 4 (i.e., "bac") results in a lexicographically smaller string "aacabba". However, the program outputs "YES" with the indices `2` and `5`, which are incorrect because the reversed substring should be from index `1` to `4`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the chosen substring is indeed the one that, when reversed, makes the overall string lexicographically smaller. The current implementation only checks for the first occurrence of a character that is greater than its successor, which might not always be the correct choice.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    c = input().strip()
    flag = False
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if c[i] > c[i + 1]:
            flag = True
            start = i
            # Find the end of the substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically smaller
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if c[j] >= c[i]:
                    end = j
                else:
                    break
            break
    
    if flag:
        print('YES')
        print(start + 1, end)
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the chosen substring is the one that, when reversed, results in a lexicographically smaller string.
