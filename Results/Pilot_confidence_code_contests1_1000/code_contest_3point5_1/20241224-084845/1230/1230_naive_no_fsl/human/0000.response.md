Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the condition where the sum of elements in a pair is at least 10 and should yield a candy. Instead, the program sums the elements and divides by 10 without checking if the sum is at least 10, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input sequence `[8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]` for the first query `(1, 8)`:

- The first operation should yield `[5, 4, 7, 3]` with 2 candies (since `8 + 7 >= 10` and `9 + 4 >= 10`).
- The second operation should yield `[9, 0]` with 1 more candy (since `7 + 3 >= 10`).
- The final operation should yield `[9]` with no additional candies.

However, the program incorrectly handles the summation and division by 10, leading to an incorrect count of candies. This can be seen in the example output where the program outputs `3`, but the correct number of candies should be `3`.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the sum of elements in a pair is at least 10 and increment the candy count accordingly before performing the modulo operation.
