You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasily the Programmer loves romance, so this year he decided to illuminate his room with candles.

Vasily has a candles.When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out. Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.

Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.

Input

The single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.

Examples

Input

4 2


Output

7


Input

6 3


Output

8

Note

Consider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
import math

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    x = n
    s = 0
    while n % m == 0 or n > m:
        if n / m >= 1:
            r = n / m
            r = r % 1
            s = s + r
        n = math.floor(n / m)
        x = x + n
    x = x + math.ceil(s)
    print(int(x))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
