Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the determinant of the matrix (a*e - b*d) is zero, which would result in no unique solution. Specifically, the program does not check if `a * e - b * d` is zero, which would indicate either no solution or infinitely many solutions. This omission means the program may produce incorrect or undefined results for certain inputs where the determinant is zero.
