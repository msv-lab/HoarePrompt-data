Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all bar lengths are the same. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly outputs the count of bars instead of the height of the tallest tower, which would be the length of the bars since they can all be stacked together.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1 3
```

This indicates that the program is not correctly calculating the height of the tallest tower when all bar lengths are the same.
