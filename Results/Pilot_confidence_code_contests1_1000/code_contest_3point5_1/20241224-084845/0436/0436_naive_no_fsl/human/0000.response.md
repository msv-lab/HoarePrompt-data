Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the minimum beauty value among the chosen songs is not properly accounted for when calculating the pleasure. Specifically, the program sorts the songs based on the negative beauty value and the length, but it does not ensure that the selected subset of songs has at most `k` songs. Instead, it calculates the pleasure using the prefix sum approach without enforcing the constraint on the number of songs selected.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 3
4 7
15 1
3 6
6 8
```

Expected Output:
```
78
```

However, the provided program may not correctly handle this case. It sorts the songs as follows:
- Song 2: (15, 1)
- Song 4: (6, 8)
- Song 1: (4, 7)
- Song 3: (3, 6)

It then calculates the pleasure using the prefix sum approach but does not enforce the constraint of selecting at most `k` songs. This can lead to an incorrect result.

For instance, the program might select songs 2, 4, and 1, which gives a pleasure of `(15 + 6 + 4) * 1 = 25`, which is not the maximum possible pleasure.

A correct solution would need to explicitly handle the selection of at most `k` songs while ensuring the minimum beauty value is used in the pleasure calculation.
