Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if there is a path between two intervals. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly check for paths between intervals. 

Consider the following case:

- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 5
  1 5 11
  2 1 2
  1 2 9
  2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output with the provided program:
  ```
  NO
  NO
  ```

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly handle the transitive property of paths between intervals. For instance, after adding the interval (2, 9), the program incorrectly determines that there is no path from the first interval (1, 5) to the third interval (2, 9). However, since the interval (2, 9) can be reached from (5, 11), and (1, 5) can be directly connected to (5, 11), there should be a path from (1, 5) to (2, 9).

To fix this, the `func_1` function needs to check for paths recursively and ensure that it handles all possible connections between intervals. The current implementation only checks direct connections and does not account for indirect paths through other intervals.
