You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem at each moment you have a set of intervals. You can move from interval (a, b) from our set to interval (c, d) from our set if and only if c < a < d or c < b < d. Also there is a path from interval I1 from our set to interval I2 from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from I1 so that we can reach I2.

Your program should handle the queries of the following two types:

  1. "1 x y" (x < y) — add the new interval (x, y) to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals.
  2. "2 a b" (a ≠ b) — answer the question: is there a path from a-th (one-based) added interval to b-th (one-based) added interval? 



Answer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n denoting the number of queries, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed 109 by their absolute value.

It's guaranteed that all queries are correct.

Output

For each query of the second type print "YES" or "NO" on a separate line depending on the answer.

Examples

Input

5
1 1 5
1 5 11
2 1 2
1 2 9
2 1 2


Output

NO
YES
Program:
```
(i, n) = ([], range(int(input())))
for l in n:
    (c, a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if c == 1:
        i += [(a, b)]
    else:
        print['NO', 'YES'][func_1(a - 1, [1 if j == b - 1 else -1 for j in n])]

def func_1(p, g):
    if g[p] == -1:
        g[p] = 0
        for v in range(len(i)):
            if i[v][0] < i[p][0] < i[v][1] or i[v][0] < i[p][1] < i[v][1]:
                if not g[p]:
                    g[p] = func_1(v, g)
    return g[p]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
