Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence does not account for all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` values that would make it impossible to form a beautiful sequence. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2 2 2 2
```

Expected output:
```
NO
```

However, the program attempts to construct a sequence and prints "YES" with a sequence, which is incorrect. Here's a possible output from the program for this input:

```
YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3
```

This sequence is not valid because it does not meet the requirement that the difference between any two consecutive numbers is exactly 1. For instance, the difference between 3 and 2 is not 1.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that it is possible to construct a beautiful sequence before attempting to generate one. This can be done by ensuring that the differences between counts of consecutive numbers do not exceed 1.
