You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a string s — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:

  * 'W' — move one cell up; 
  * 'S' — move one cell down; 
  * 'A' — move one cell left; 
  * 'D' — move one cell right. 



Let Grid(s) be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands s. For example, if s = DSAWWAW then Grid(s) is the 4 × 3 grid:

  1. you can place the robot in the cell (3, 2); 
  2. the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to (3, 3); 
  3. the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to (4, 3); 
  4. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to (4, 2); 
  5. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to (3, 2); 
  6. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to (2, 2); 
  7. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to (2, 1); 
  8. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to (1, 1). 

<image>

You have 4 extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insert at most one of these letters in any position of sequence s to minimize the area of Grid(s).

What is the minimum area of Grid(s) you can achieve?

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the number of queries.

Next T lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, s_i ∈ \{W, A, S, D\}) — the sequence of commands.

It's guaranteed that the total length of s over all queries doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

Print T integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of Grid(s) you can achieve.

Example

Input


3
DSAWWAW
D
WA


Output


8
2
4

Note

In the first query you have to get string DSAWW\underline{D}AW.

In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of Grid(s).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
