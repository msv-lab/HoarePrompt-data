Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a city is exactly at the position of a tower. According to the problem description, a tower provides cellular network for a city if the distance between them is no more than \( r \). However, the current implementation uses `abs(el - b[i])` to calculate the distance, which means it does not account for the scenario where the city is at the exact position of the tower. This could lead to an incorrect result if the tower's position is included in the calculation without considering the distance constraint.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 1
-2 2 4
0
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the city is at the exact position of the tower. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
