Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all heroes have the same initial level. According to the problem description, if all heroes have the same initial level, no hero will ever win any fight because each fight between two heroes of the same level results in no winner. However, the program incorrectly outputs the number of heroes with a level greater than the minimum level, which is incorrect in this scenario.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
5 5
```

The expected output is `0` since no hero can win the tournament if all have the same level. However, the program will output `1` because there is one hero with a level greater than the minimum level (which is 5 in this case).

To fix this, the program needs to check if all heroes have the same initial level and handle this case appropriately.
