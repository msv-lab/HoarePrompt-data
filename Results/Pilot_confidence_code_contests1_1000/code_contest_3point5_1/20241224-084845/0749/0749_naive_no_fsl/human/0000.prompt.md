You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: n heroes fight against each other in the Arena. Initially, the i-th hero has level a_i.

Each minute, a fight between two different heroes occurs. These heroes can be chosen arbitrarily (it's even possible that it is the same two heroes that were fighting during the last minute).

When two heroes of equal levels fight, nobody wins the fight. When two heroes of different levels fight, the one with the higher level wins, and his level increases by 1.

The winner of the tournament is the first hero that wins in at least 100^{500} fights (note that it's possible that the tournament lasts forever if no hero wins this number of fights, then there is no winner). A possible winner is a hero such that there exists a sequence of fights that this hero becomes the winner of the tournament.

Calculate the number of possible winners among n heroes.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of heroes. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a_i is the initial level of the i-th hero.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible winners among the given n heroes.

Example

Input


3
3
3 2 2
2
5 5
4
1 3 3 7


Output


1
0
3

Note

In the first test case of the example, the only possible winner is the first hero.

In the second test case of the example, each fight between the heroes results in nobody winning it, so the tournament lasts forever and there is no winner.
Program:
```
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
class InputData:

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines = readAll().split('\n')
        self.n = len(self.lines)
        self.ii = -1

    def input(self):
        self.ii += 1
        assert self.ii < self.n
        return self.lines[self.ii]
inputData = InputData()
input = inputData.input
for _ in xrange(func_1()):
    func_6()
if testing:
    sys.stdout = cmd
    print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

def func_1():
    return int(input())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def func_3():
    return list(input())

def func_4():
    return input()

def func_5(l, sep='\n'):
    print(sep.join(l))

def func_6():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_2()
    print(sum([1 for x in a if x > min(a)]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
