Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the general case correctly for all even values of \( n \). Specifically, the formula used in the program is designed for a specific configuration of the 2n-gon, but it does not account for all possible rotations and placements of the 2n-gon within the square.

For \( n = 2 \), the 2n-gon is a square, and the formula works because the square fits perfectly into a larger square. However, for other values of \( n \), the formula does not guarantee the minimum side length of the enclosing square.

To illustrate, let's consider \( n = 4 \):

- The 8-gon (octagon) can be inscribed in a square with side length approximately \( 2.414213562 \), but the provided program outputs the value directly using the formula without verifying the minimum side length through geometric analysis.

The formula used in the program is derived from specific geometric properties and may not always yield the correct minimum side length for the square that can enclose the 2n-gon for all even \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect for some cases.
