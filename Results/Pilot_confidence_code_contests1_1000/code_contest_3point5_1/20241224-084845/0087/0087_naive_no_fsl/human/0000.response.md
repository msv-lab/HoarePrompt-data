Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the remaining recordable time for both standard and triple recording modes. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input until `T, H, S` are all `-1`, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Time Calculation**:
   - It converts the input hours, minutes, and seconds into total seconds.
   - For standard recording, it calculates the remaining time by subtracting the used time from the total possible time (`7200` seconds).
   - For triple recording, it divides the remaining time by `3` since each unit of time can be used three times.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output in the required format, ensuring leading zeros are added where necessary.

Since the program handles all inputs within the specified constraints (up to 2 hours or 120 minutes) and correctly calculates the remaining time for both recording modes, it meets the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
