Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for assigning police officers to crimes. Specifically, the program increments the `sim` counter without properly decrementing it when a crime occurs. This results in an incorrect count of untreated crimes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
-1 -1 1
```

According to the problem description:
1. One crime occurs.
2. Another crime occurs.
3. One officer is hired.

The program will incorrectly count the number of crimes as follows:
- After the first crime: `sim = -1`, `cnt = 1`.
- After the second crime: `sim = -2`, `cnt = 2`.

However, after hiring one officer, the `sim` counter should reset to 0, and only the second crime should be counted as untreated, making the correct output `1`.

To fix this, the program should properly manage the `sim` counter by decrementing it when a crime occurs and resetting it when officers are hired. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cnt = 0
    sim = 0
    list = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    for i in list:
        if i == -1:
            if sim <= 0:
                cnt += 1
            sim -= 1
        else:
            sim += i
    print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `sim` counter is decremented correctly when a crime occurs and reset when officers are hired, thus accurately counting the number of untreated crimes.
