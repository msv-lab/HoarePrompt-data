You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The police department of your city has just started its journey. Initially, they don’t have any manpower. So, they started hiring new recruits in groups.

Meanwhile, crimes keeps occurring within the city. One member of the police force can investigate only one crime during his/her lifetime.

If there is no police officer free (isn't busy with crime) during the occurrence of a crime, it will go untreated.

Given the chronological order of crime occurrences and recruit hirings, find the number of crimes which will go untreated.

Input

The first line of input will contain an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of events. The next line will contain n space-separated integers.

If the integer is -1 then it means a crime has occurred. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time. No more than 10 officers will be recruited at a time.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of crimes which will go untreated.

Examples

Input

3
-1 -1 1


Output

2


Input

8
1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1


Output

1


Input

11
-1 -1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1


Output

8

Note

Lets consider the second example:

  1. Firstly one person is hired. 
  2. Then crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime. 
  3. One more person is hired. 
  4. One more crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime. 
  5. Crime appears. There is no free policeman at the time, so this crime will go untreated. 
  6. One more person is hired. 
  7. One more person is hired. 
  8. One more person is hired. 



The answer is one, as one crime (on step 5) will go untreated.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt = 0
    sim = 0
    c = raw_input
    c()
    list = map(int, c().split(' '))
    for i in list:
        sim += i
        if sim < 0:
            cnt += 1
            sim = 0
    print(cnt)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
