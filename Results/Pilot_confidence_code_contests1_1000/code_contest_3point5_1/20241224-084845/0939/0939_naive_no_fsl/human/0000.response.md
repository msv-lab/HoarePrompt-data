Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the count of odd numbers is even, and prints `YES` if it is, otherwise `NO`. However, this logic is incomplete. The key aspect is to ensure that the number of odd integers is even because each operation reduces the count of odd numbers by 2 (if both selected numbers are odd). If the count of odd numbers is odd initially, it will never become zero through the described operations. 

The program fails to handle cases where the initial count of odd numbers is odd. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

In this case, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5), which is odd. The program will incorrectly output `YES`, but it should output `NO` because it's impossible to have only one integer left on the blackboard. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
