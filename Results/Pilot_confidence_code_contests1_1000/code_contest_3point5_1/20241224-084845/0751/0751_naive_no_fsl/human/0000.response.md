Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to assign "+" and "-" signs to the numbers does not always ensure that the resulting sum \( s \) falls within the required range \( 0 \leq s \leq a_1 \). 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 5
```
The expected output should be `+++--` because:
- If we assign `+` to the first three numbers and `-` to the last number, the expression becomes \(1 + 2 + 3 - 5 = 1\), which satisfies the condition \(0 \leq s \leq 1\).
However, the given program outputs `+++`, which results in \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), which is outside the required range.

Another example is:
```
3
3 3 5
```
The expected output should be `+-`, because:
- Assigning `+` to the first two numbers and `-` to the last number gives \(3 + 3 - 5 = 1\), which is within the required range.
But the program outputs `++-`, which results in \(3 + 3 - 5 = 1\), which is also correct but not the only valid solution. However, the main issue is that the program does not guarantee that the sum will be within the required range for all inputs.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, hence the output is `False`.
