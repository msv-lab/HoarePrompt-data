You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has found a piece of paper with an array written on it. The array consists of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Vasya noticed that the following condition holds for the array ai ≤ ai + 1 ≤ 2·ai for any positive integer i (i < n).

Vasya wants to add either a "+" or a "-" before each number of array. Thus, Vasya will get an expression consisting of n summands. The value of the resulting expression is the sum of all its elements. The task is to add signs "+" and "-" before each number so that the value of expression s meets the limits 0 ≤ s ≤ a1. Print a sequence of signs "+" and "-", satisfying the given limits. It is guaranteed that the solution for the problem exists.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the original array. 

It is guaranteed that the condition ai ≤ ai + 1 ≤ 2·ai fulfills for any positive integer i (i < n).

Output

In a single line print the sequence of n characters "+" and "-", where the i-th character is the sign that is placed in front of number ai. The value of the resulting expression s must fit into the limits 0 ≤ s ≤ a1. If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

        if sum1 <= sum2:
            sum1 = sum1 + mas[i]
            ans.append(0)
        else:
            sum2 = sum2 + mas[i]
            ans.append(1)
    ans.reverse()
    for i in range(n):
        if sum1 < sum2:
            ans[i] = 1 - ans[i]
        if ans[i] == 0:
            sys.stdout.write('+')
        else:
            sys.stdout.write('-')

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
