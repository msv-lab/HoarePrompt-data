Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility of decreasing the coordinate of A instead of increasing it. According to the problem description, we can either increase or decrease the coordinate of A by 1 to make the point B exist, and we need to find the minimum number of steps.

For example, consider the test case `(n, k) = (0, 1000000)`. The program will output `1000000`, which is correct. However, for the test case `(n, k) = (1, 0)`, the program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `0` because we can set B at coordinate 1 directly, making the absolute difference 0 without moving A.

Additionally, for the test case `(n, k) = (1000000, 1000000)`, the program will output `0`, which is correct. But the program does not consider the scenario where we can decrease n by 1 to make the solution valid in fewer steps.

Therefore, the program does not always find the minimum number of steps correctly and hence is incorrect.
