Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid triples (i, j, k) that satisfy the given conditions. The program first constructs lists of indices for each character ('R', 'G', 'B') in the input string. It then iterates through all possible combinations of indices for the characters and uses binary search to ensure that the condition \( j - i \neq k - j \) is met. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic seems sound for finding valid triples. There were no specific edge cases or examples found where the program did not meet the requirements.
