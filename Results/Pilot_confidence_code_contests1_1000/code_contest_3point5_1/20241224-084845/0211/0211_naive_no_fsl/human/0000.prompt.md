You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Natasha is going to fly to Mars. She needs to build a rocket, which consists of several stages in some order. Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string — concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.

There are n stages available. The rocket must contain exactly k of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.

For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z' — 26 tons.

Build the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all. Each stage can be used at most once.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers — n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) – the number of available stages and the number of stages to use in the rocket.

The second line contains string s, which consists of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. Each letter defines a new stage, which can be used to build the rocket. Each stage can be used at most once.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal total weight of the rocket or -1, if it is impossible to build the rocket at all.

Note

In the first example, the following rockets satisfy the condition:

  * "adx" (weight is 1+4+24=29);
  * "ady" (weight is 1+4+25=30);
  * "bdx" (weight is 2+4+24=30);
  * "bdy" (weight is 2+4+25=31).



Rocket "adx" has the minimal weight, so the answer is 29.

In the second example, target rocket is "belo". Its weight is 2+5+12+15=34.

In the third example, n=k=2, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'. This rocket doesn't satisfy the condition, because these letters are adjacent in the alphabet. Answer is -1.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from string import ascii_lowercase

(n, k) = func_1()
steps = sorted(stdin.readline().strip())
w = 0
i = 0
nb = 0
while i < n and nb < k:
    step = steps[i]
    w += ascii_lowercase.index(step) + 1
    i += 2
    nb += 1
print - 1 if nb != k else w

def func_1():
    return map(int, stdin.readline().split())


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
