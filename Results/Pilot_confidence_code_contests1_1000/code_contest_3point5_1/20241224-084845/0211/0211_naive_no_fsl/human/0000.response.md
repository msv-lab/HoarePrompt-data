Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the selected stages are in strictly increasing order according to their positions in the alphabet, skipping at least one letter in between. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
xyabd
```

According to the problem description, the valid rockets should include:
- "adx" (weight is 1+4+24=29)
- "ady" (weight is 1+4+25=30)
- "bdx" (weight is 2+4+24=30)
- "bdy" (weight is 2+4+25=31)

However, the program's logic only skips one letter at a time and may miss some valid combinations. The program will incorrectly select "bdy" (weight 31) instead of "adx" (weight 29), which is the minimum weight rocket.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after selecting a stage, the next stage is at least two positions ahead in the alphabet. This can be achieved by checking the next possible stages in a loop until a valid one is found.
