Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible configurations of the dice and their contributions to the total number of visible pips. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  37 42
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  ```

However, the program will output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  ```

The program only checks for a few specific conditions and does not cover all possible configurations that could result in 37 or 42 visible pips. For instance, to get 42 visible pips, the top face of the bottom die must be 1, and the other faces must be configured such that no pips are hidden. The program does not account for all such valid configurations, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
