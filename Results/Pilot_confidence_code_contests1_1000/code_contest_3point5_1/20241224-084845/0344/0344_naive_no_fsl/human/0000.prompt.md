You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: problem

Given two strings, find the longest of the strings contained in both strings and write a program that answers that length.

Here, the string s included in the string t means that s appears consecutively in t. An empty string, that is, a string of length 0, is included in any string. For example, the string ABRACADABRA contains the following strings: ABRA, RAC, D, ACADABRA, ABRACADABRA, the empty string, etc. On the other hand, the string ABRACADABRA does not contain the following strings: ABRC, RAA, BA , K etc.



input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format.

The input consists of two lines, the first line is given the first string and the second line is given the second string. The strings consist of uppercase letters and each string is 1 in length. More than 4000 and less.

Of the scoring data, for 30% of the points, the length of each character string is 1 or more and 50 or less.

The end of input is indicated by EOF. The number of datasets does not exceed 10.

output

Outputs the length of the longest string contained in both of the two strings given for each dataset on one line.

while True:

        t = input().strip()

    t = [b[k + i] - b[i] * pow_p[k] & q for i in range(m - k)]
    return len(set(s).intersection(set(t))) > 0

def func_2(s):

    while l + 1 < r:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if func_1(a, b, m):
            l = m
        else:
            r = m
    return l

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
