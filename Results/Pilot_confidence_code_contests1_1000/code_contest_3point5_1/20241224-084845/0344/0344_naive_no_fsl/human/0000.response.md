Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_3` is designed to find the longest common substring using a hashing approach with polynomial rolling hash, but the problem description asks for the length of the longest string contained in both strings, not necessarily a contiguous substring.

For example, consider the input:
```
ABRACADABRA
ECADADABRBCRDARA
```

The longest string contained in both strings is "CADADABR", which has a length of 9. However, the program will incorrectly compute the length of the longest common subsequence, not the longest common substring.

To verify this, let's manually check the output for the given input:
- For "ABRACADABRA" and "ECADADABRBCRDARA", the longest common substring is "CADADABR" with a length of 9.

Since the program does not correctly handle the requirement of finding the longest string contained in both strings (it instead finds the longest common subsequence), the program is incorrect.
