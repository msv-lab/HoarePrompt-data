You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

You can rearrange all letters of this string as you wish. Your task is to obtain a good string by rearranging the letters of the given string or report that it is impossible to do it.

Let's call a string good if it is not a palindrome. Palindrome is a string which is read from left to right the same as from right to left. For example, strings "abacaba", "aa" and "z" are palindromes and strings "bba", "xd" are not.

You have to answer t independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — number of queries.

Each of the next t lines contains one string. The i-th line contains a string s_i consisting only of lowercase Latin letter. It is guaranteed that the length of s_i is from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).

Output

Print t lines. In the i-th line print the answer to the i-th query: -1 if it is impossible to obtain a good string by rearranging the letters of s_i and any good string which can be obtained from the given one (by rearranging the letters) otherwise.

Example

Input


3
aa
abacaba
xdd


Output


-1
abaacba
xdd

Note

In the first query we cannot rearrange letters to obtain a good string.

Other examples (not all) of correct answers to the second query: "ababaca", "abcabaa", "baacaba".

In the third query we can do nothing to obtain a good string.
Program:
```
def func():
    k = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(k):
        l = raw_input()
        str1 = ''
        flag = False
        if l == l[::-1]:
            for j in range(1, len(l)):
                if l[j] != l[0]:
                    flag = True
                    str1 = l[j] + l[1:j] + l[0] + l[j + 1:]
                    break
        else:
            flag = True
            str1 = l
        if flag == False:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(str1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
