Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all characters in the string are the same. For example, consider the input `aa`. According to the problem description, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to rearrange the letters to form a non-palindromic string. However, the current implementation will generate a new string by swapping the first and second characters, resulting in `a` and `a`, which is still a palindrome. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
