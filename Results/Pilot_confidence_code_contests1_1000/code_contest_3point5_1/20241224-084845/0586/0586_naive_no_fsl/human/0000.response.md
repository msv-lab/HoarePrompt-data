Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits while maintaining the required ratio of taste to calories. The dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` dictionary ensures that all possible combinations of fruits are considered, and the condition `a - b * k` is used to calculate the adjusted taste value for each fruit. The program correctly handles the case where no valid combination exists by printing `-1`.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. The dynamic programming solution ensures that the maximum taste is found while adhering to the specified ratio. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the current implementation.
