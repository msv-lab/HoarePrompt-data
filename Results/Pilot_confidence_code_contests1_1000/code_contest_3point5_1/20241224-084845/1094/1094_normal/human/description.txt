How many integer sequences A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N of length N satisfy all of the following conditions?

* 0 \leq A_i \leq 9
* There exists some i such that A_i=0 holds.
* There exists some i such that A_i=9 holds.



The answer can be very large, so output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^6
* N is an integer.
