You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths A, B and C. 

Find the number of different groups of three integers (a, b, c) such that 1≤ a≤ b≤ c and parallelepiped A× B× C can be paved with parallelepipeds a× b× c. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction.

For example, parallelepiped 1× 5× 6 can be divided into parallelepipeds 1× 3× 5, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds 1× 2× 3.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases.

Each of the next t lines contains three integers A, B and C (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10^5) — the sizes of the parallelepiped.

Output

For each test case, print the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions.

Example

Input

4
1 1 1
1 6 1
2 2 2
100 100 100


Output

1
4
4
165

Note

In the first test case, rectangular parallelepiped (1, 1, 1) can be only divided into rectangular parallelepiped with sizes (1, 1, 1).

In the second test case, rectangular parallelepiped (1, 6, 1) can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3) and (1, 1, 6).

In the third test case, rectangular parallelepiped (2, 2, 2) can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 2). 
Program:
```
fac = [0 for i in range(100001)]
for i in range(1, 100001):
    for j in range(i, 100001, i):
        fac[j] += 1
n = input()
for i in range(n):
    (A, B, C) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    la = fac[A]
    lb = fac[B]
    lc = fac[C]
    ab = func_1(A, B)
    ac = func_1(A, C)
    bc = func_1(B, C)
    abc = func_1(ab, C)
    dupabc = fac[abc]
    dupac = fac[ac] - dupabc
    dupbc = fac[bc] - dupabc
    dupab = fac[ab] - dupabc
    lax = la - dupabc - dupab - dupac
    lbx = lb - dupabc - dupab - dupbc
    lcx = lc - dupabc - dupac - dupbc
    ctx = lax * lbx * lcx
    ctx += lax * lbx * (lc - lcx)
    ctx += lax * lcx * (lb - lbx)
    ctx += lcx * lbx * (la - lax)
    ctx += lax * ((lb - lbx) * (lc - lcx) - (dupabc + dupbc) * (dupabc + dupbc - 1) / 2)
    ctx += lbx * ((la - lax) * (lc - lcx) - (dupabc + dupac) * (dupabc + dupac - 1) / 2)
    ctx += lcx * ((la - lax) * (lb - lbx) - (dupabc + dupab) * (dupabc + dupab - 1) / 2)
    ctx += dupab * dupac * dupbc
    ctx += dupab * dupac * (dupab + dupac + 2) / 2
    ctx += dupab * dupbc * (dupab + dupbc + 2) / 2
    ctx += dupbc * dupac * (dupbc + dupac + 2) / 2
    ctx += dupabc * (dupab * dupac + dupab * dupbc + dupbc * dupac)
    ctx += dupabc * (dupab * (dupab + 1) + (dupbc + 1) * dupbc + (dupac + 1) * dupac) / 2
    ctx += (dupabc + 1) * dupabc * (dupab + dupac + dupbc) / 2
    ctx += dupabc * dupabc + dupabc * (dupabc - 1) * (dupabc - 2) / 6
    print(ctx)
exit()

    if a < b:
        (a, b) = (b, a)
    while b > 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
