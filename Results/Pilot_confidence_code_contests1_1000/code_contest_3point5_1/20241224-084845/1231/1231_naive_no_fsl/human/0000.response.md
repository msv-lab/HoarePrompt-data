Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of all elements in a row or a column will be the same for each row and column. Specifically, the program constructs the grid by rotating a deque, but this approach does not ensure the required property of equal XOR values for all rows and columns.

For instance, consider the following input:

**Input**
```
4
```

**Expected Output** (one possible valid solution):
```
8 9 1 13
3 12 7 5
0 2 4 11
6 10 15 14
```
Here, the XOR of each row and each column is 13.

However, the provided program does not guarantee such properties. For example, with the same input, the output might look like this:

**Output**
```
0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```
In this case, the XOR of the first row is 6 (0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3), the second row is 12 (4 ^ 5 ^ 6 ^ 7), and so on. This does not meet the requirement that the XOR of all elements in a row or a column must be the same.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the construction of a magic grid as defined in the problem statement.
