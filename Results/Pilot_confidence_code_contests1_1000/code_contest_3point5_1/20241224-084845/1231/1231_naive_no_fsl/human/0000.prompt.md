You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let us define a magic grid to be a square matrix of integers of size n × n, satisfying the following conditions. 

  * All integers from 0 to (n^2 - 1) inclusive appear in the matrix exactly once. 
  * [Bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of all elements in a row or a column must be the same for each row and column. 



You are given an integer n which is a multiple of 4. Construct a magic grid of size n × n.

Input

The only line of input contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that n is a multiple of 4.

Output

Print a magic grid, i.e. n lines, the i-th of which contains n space-separated integers, representing the i-th row of the grid.

If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Examples

Input

Output


8 9 1 13
3 12 7 5
0 2 4 11
6 10 15 14

Input


8


Output


19 55 11 39 32 36 4 52
51 7 35 31 12 48 28 20
43 23 59 15 0 8 16 44
3 47 27 63 24 40 60 56
34 38 6 54 17 53 9 37
14 50 30 22 49 5 33 29
2 10 18 46 41 21 57 13
26 42 62 58 1 45 25 61

Note

In the first example, XOR of each row and each column is 13.

In the second example, XOR of each row and each column is 60.
Program:
```
from collections import deque

def func():
    ispow2 = lambda x: x and (not x & x - 1)
    (n, cur, ans) = (int(input()), 0, [])
    for i in range(n):
        tem = deque(range(cur, cur + n))
        while i and (not ispow2(tem[0] - ans[-1][0])):
            tem.rotate(-1)
        ans.append(tem)
        cur += n
    print('\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, x)) for x in ans]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
