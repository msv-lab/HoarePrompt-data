Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:** The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the dynamic rating changes and the exclusion process. Specifically, the program does not properly update the sum `s` and the length of the array `a` after each participant is excluded. This leads to incorrect calculations and results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 0
5 3 4 1 2
```

The program should output:
```
2
3
4
```

However, the program provided does not produce the correct output. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. Initial ratings: `[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]`
2. After excluding the 2nd place participant (rating 3):
   - New ratings: `[5, 4, 1, 2]`
   - Updated sum `s`: `0 - (4-1)*(3-0) = -9`
3. After excluding the 3rd place participant (rating 4):
   - New ratings: `[5, 1, 2]`
   - Updated sum `s`: `-9 - (3-1)*(4-1) = -13`
4. After excluding the 4th place participant (rating 1):
   - New ratings: `[5, 2]`
   - Updated sum `s`: `-13 - (2-1)*(1-1) = -13`

The program fails to correctly update the sum `s` and the length of the array `a` after each exclusion, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
