You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cells, numbered 1,2,..., n from left to right. You have to place a robot at any cell initially. The robot must make exactly k moves.

In one move, the robot must move one cell to the left or right, provided that it doesn't move out of bounds. In other words, if the robot was in the cell i, it must move to either the cell i-1 or the cell i+1, as long as it lies between 1 and n (endpoints inclusive). The cells, in the order they are visited (including the cell the robot is placed), together make a good path.

Each cell i has a value a_i associated with it. Let c_0, c_1, ..., c_k be the sequence of cells in a good path in the order they are visited (c_0 is the cell robot is initially placed, c_1 is the cell where the robot is after its first move, and so on; more formally, c_i is the cell that the robot is at after i moves). Then the value of the path is calculated as a_{c_0} + a_{c_1} + ... + a_{c_k}.

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all possible good paths. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Two good paths are considered different if the starting cell differs or there exists an integer i ∈ [1, k] such that the current cell of the robot after exactly i moves is different in those paths.

You must process q updates to a and print the updated sum each time. Each update changes the value of exactly one cell. See the input format and the sample input-output for more details.

Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, k and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 5000; 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

q lines follow. Each line contains two space-separated integers i and x (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) indicating that you must change the value of a_i to x.

Output

Print q integers. The i-th integer should be the sum of values over all good paths after the first i updates are performed. Since the answers may be large, print them modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note

In the first example, the good paths are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4).

Initially the values of a are [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]. After the first update, they become [9, 5, 1, 4, 2]. After the second update, they become [9, 4, 1, 4, 2], and so on.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
