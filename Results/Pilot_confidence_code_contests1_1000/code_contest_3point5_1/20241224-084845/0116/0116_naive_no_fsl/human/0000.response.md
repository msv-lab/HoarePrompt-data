Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not account for the rereading of the last `l` pages every day starting from the second day. Specifically, after updating the remaining pages `c -= min(v0 + days * a, v1)`, the program should decrease `c` by `l` to reflect the rereading, but this step is missing. 

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input `12 4 12 4 1`. According to the problem description:
- On the first day, Mister B reads pages 1-4.
- On the second day, he reads pages 4-11, but he needs to reread the last 1 page (page 11) before moving on.

The program will calculate:
1. Day 1: Reads 4 pages, remaining pages = 12 - 4 = 8.
2. Day 2: Reads 8 pages, remaining pages = 8 - 8 = 0.

However, the rereading step (subtracting `l` pages) is missing, so the program incorrectly prints 2 days instead of 3 days.

To fix this, you need to include the rereading step inside the loop:
```python
def func():
    (c, v0, v1, a, l) = map(int, input().split())
    days = 0
    while c > 0:
        read_today = min(v0 + days * a, v1)
        c -= read_today
        if c > 0:
            c += l
        days += 1
    print(days)
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
