You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is an organizer of a Berland ICPC regional event. There are n universities in Berland numbered from 1 to n. Polycarp knows all competitive programmers in the region. There are n students: the i-th student is enrolled at a university u_i and has a programming skill s_i.

Polycarp has to decide on the rules now. In particular, the number of members in the team.

Polycarp knows that if he chooses the size of the team to be some integer k, each university will send their k strongest (with the highest programming skill s) students in the first team, the next k strongest students in the second team and so on. If there are fewer than k students left, then the team can't be formed. Note that there might be universities that send zero teams.

The strength of the region is the total skill of the members of all present teams. If there are no teams present, then the strength is 0.

Help Polycarp to find the strength of the region for each choice of k from 1 to n.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of universities and the number of students.

The second line of each testcase contains n integers u_1, u_2, ..., u_n (1 ≤ u_i ≤ n) — the university the i-th student is enrolled at.

The third line of each testcase contains n integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_n (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9) — the programming skill of the i-th student.

The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each testcase print n integers: the strength of the region — the total skill of the members of the present teams — for each choice of team size k.

Note

In the first testcase the teams from each university for each k are: 

  * k=1: 
    * university 1: [6], [5], [5], [3]; 
    * university 2: [8], [1], [1]; 
  * k=2: 
    * university 1: [6, 5], [5, 3]; 
    * university 2: [8, 1]; 
  * k=3: 
    * university 1: [6, 5, 5]; 
    * university 2: [8, 1, 1]; 
  * k=4: 
    * university 1: [6, 5, 5, 3];

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
