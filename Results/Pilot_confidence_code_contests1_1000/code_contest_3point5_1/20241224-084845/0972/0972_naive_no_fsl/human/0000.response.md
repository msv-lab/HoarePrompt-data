Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple teams can be formed but does not indicate this ambiguity. Specifically, if there are at least three participants with the highest score in a region, and their scores are equal, the program does not check if there are multiple valid teams. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

In this case, for region 1, there are three participants with the highest score of 800. According to the problem description, since there is more than one valid team, the output should be `?`. However, the current implementation sorts the participants by score and selects the last two participants, which would output:

```
Ivanov Sidorov
```

This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of multiple valid teams. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in this scenario.
