Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if square1001 can achieve his objective. Specifically, the program uses a fixed distance of 1 to check the adjacent squares, which is insufficient to handle all possible cases.

Consider the following test case:

```
3 3
#.#
###
.#.
```

In this case, the center square (2,2) needs to be painted black, but the program incorrectly prints "Yes" because it only checks the immediate neighbors without considering a broader approach to painting the entire row and column if necessary.

The program should check if it's possible to paint the entire row or column containing the target square if the adjacent squares do not provide enough information. Here's an example of how the program could be improved:

```python
import numpy as np

def func():
    (H, W) = map(int, input().split())
    S = np.zeros((H, W))
    for i in range(H):
        tmp = list(input())
        for j in range(W):
            if tmp[j] == '#':
                S[i, j] = 1
            else:
                S[i, j] = 0
    
    # Check each row and column
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if S[i, j] == 1:
                # Check if we can paint the entire row or column
                row_paintable = True
                col_paintable = True
                for k in range(W):
                    if S[i, k] == 0:
                        row_paintable = False
                        break
                for k in range(H):
                    if S[k, j] == 0:
                        col_paintable = False
                        break
                
                if not row_paintable and not col_paintable:
                    print('No')
                    return
    
    print('Yes')

func()
```

This updated version ensures that the program checks if it's possible to paint the entire row or column if needed, which would handle the given test case correctly.
