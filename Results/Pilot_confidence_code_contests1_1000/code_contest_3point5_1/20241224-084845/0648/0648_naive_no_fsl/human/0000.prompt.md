You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi has N blue cards and M red cards. A string is written on each card. The string written on the i-th blue card is s_i, and the string written on the i-th red card is t_i.

Takahashi will now announce a string, and then check every card. Each time he finds a blue card with the string announced by him, he will earn 1 yen (the currency of Japan); each time he finds a red card with that string, he will lose 1 yen.

Here, we only consider the case where the string announced by Takahashi and the string on the card are exactly the same. For example, if he announces `atcoder`, he will not earn money even if there are blue cards with `atcoderr`, `atcode`, `btcoder`, and so on. (On the other hand, he will not lose money even if there are red cards with such strings, either.)

At most how much can he earn on balance?

Note that the same string may be written on multiple cards.

Constraints

* N and M are integers.
* 1 \leq N, M \leq 100
* s_1, s_2, ..., s_N, t_1, t_2, ..., t_M are all strings of lengths between 1 and 10 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
s_1
s_2
:
s_N
M
t_1
t_2
:
t_M


Output

If Takahashi can earn at most X yen on balance, print X.

        n.append(raw_input())
    M = input()
    m = []
    for i in range(M):
        m.append(raw_input())
    result = [n.count(a) - m.count(a) for a in n]
    max_ = max(result)
    if max_ < 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(max_)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
