Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of divisors of `c` between `a` and `b`. Specifically, the line `if c / i == 0:` should be `if c % i == 0:`. This is because we need to check if `i` is a divisor of `c`, not if `c` divided by `i` equals zero. The current implementation will always result in zero divisions since `c / i` will never be zero for valid `i` values in the range `[a, b]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
