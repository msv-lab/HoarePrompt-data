Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to be using a complex geometric approach to calculate the star area, but it does not fully implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the connection of each point with the two maximally distant points as required. Instead, it appears to be attempting to calculate some intermediate vectors and areas without properly implementing the star formation logic.

To verify this, consider a star with `n=7` and `r=10`. According to the problem description, the star is formed by connecting each point on the circle with the two maximally distant points. However, the program's current implementation does not correctly reflect this step. For instance, the function `func_7` is used to calculate some vector operations, but it does not ensure that the connections are made with the maximally distant points as required.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct star area for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
