You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The last stage of Football World Cup is played using the play-off system.

There are n teams left in this stage, they are enumerated from 1 to n. Several rounds are held, in each round the remaining teams are sorted in the order of their ids, then the first in this order plays with the second, the third — with the fourth, the fifth — with the sixth, and so on. It is guaranteed that in each round there is even number of teams. The winner of each game advances to the next round, the loser is eliminated from the tournament, there are no draws. In the last round there is the only game with two remaining teams: the round is called the Final, the winner is called the champion, and the tournament is over.

Arkady wants his two favorite teams to play in the Final. Unfortunately, the team ids are already determined, and it may happen that it is impossible for teams to meet in the Final, because they are to meet in some earlier stage, if they are strong enough. Determine, in which round the teams with ids a and b can meet.

Input

The only line contains three integers n, a and b (2 ≤ n ≤ 256, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the total number of teams, and the ids of the teams that Arkady is interested in. 

It is guaranteed that n is such that in each round an even number of team advance, and that a and b are not equal.

Output

In the only line print "Final!" (without quotes), if teams a and b can meet in the Final.

Otherwise, print a single integer — the number of the round in which teams a and b can meet. The round are enumerated from 1.

Examples

Input

4 1 2


Output

1


Input

8 2 6


Output

Final!


Input

8 7 5


Output

2

Note

In the first example teams 1 and 2 meet in the first round.

In the second example teams 2 and 6 can only meet in the third round, which is the Final, if they win all their opponents in earlier rounds.

In the third example the teams with ids 7 and 5 can meet in the second round, if they win their opponents in the first round.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    i = 0
    if a > n / 2 and b <= n / 2 or (a <= n / 2 and b > n / 2):
        print('Final!')
        exit(0)
    while a != b:
        i += 1
        a = (a + 1) / 2
        b = (b + 1) / 2
    print(i)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
