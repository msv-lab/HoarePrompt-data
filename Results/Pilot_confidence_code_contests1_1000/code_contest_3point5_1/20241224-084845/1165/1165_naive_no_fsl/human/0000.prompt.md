You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a blackboard and initially only an odd number x is written on it. Your goal is to write the number 1 on the blackboard.

You may write new numbers on the blackboard with the following two operations. 

  * You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their sum on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard. 
  * You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard. 

Perform a sequence of operations such that at the end the number 1 is on the blackboard.

Input

The single line of the input contains the odd integer x (3 ≤ x ≤ 999,999).

Output

Print on the first line the number q of operations you perform. Then q lines should follow, each describing one operation. 

  * The "sum" operation is described by the line "a + b", where a, b must be integers already present on the blackboard. 
  * The "xor" operation is described by the line "a ^ b", where a, b must be integers already present on the blackboard. 

The operation symbol (+ or ^) must be separated from a, b by a whitespace.

You can perform at most 100,000 operations (that is, q≤ 100,000) and all numbers written on the blackboard must be in the range [0, 5⋅10^{18}]. It can be proven that under such restrictions the required sequence of operations exists. You can output any suitable sequence of operations.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
