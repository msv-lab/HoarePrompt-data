Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of labels for the given directed acyclic graph. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary variables including `indeg` (indegree array) to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each vertex and `g` (adjacency list) to represent the graph.

2. **Graph Construction**: It reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then constructs the graph using adjacency lists and updates the indegree array accordingly.

3. **Topological Sort Preparation**: It identifies vertices with zero indegree (i.e., vertices with no incoming edges) and adds them to a priority queue (`avail`). This step ensures that we start assigning labels to vertices in topologically sorted order.

4. **Label Assignment**: Using a while loop, the program processes each vertex with zero indegree. It assigns the next available label to the current vertex and increments the label. For each neighbor of the current vertex, it decrements the indegree. If a neighbor's indegree becomes zero, it is added to the priority queue.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the labels in the required format.

This approach guarantees that the labels form a valid permutation and respect the constraints of the problem. Since the program handles all described steps and conditions, it is correct for the given problem description.
