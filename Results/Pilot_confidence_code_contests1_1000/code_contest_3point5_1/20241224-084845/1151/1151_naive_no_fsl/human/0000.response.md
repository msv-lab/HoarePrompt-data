Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string might contain non-alphabetical characters. According to the problem description, the program should only convert alphabetical letters and leave other characters unchanged. However, the current implementation does not account for this, and it will attempt to convert all characters, including spaces and punctuation. For example, if the input is "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.", the expected output is "Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.", but the program will incorrectly modify the commas and spaces as well. To fix this, you need to ensure that only alphabetical characters are converted, while other characters remain unchanged.
