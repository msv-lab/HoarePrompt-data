You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A company of n friends wants to order exactly two pizzas. It is known that in total there are 9 pizza ingredients in nature, which are denoted by integers from 1 to 9.

Each of the n friends has one or more favorite ingredients: the i-th of friends has the number of favorite ingredients equal to f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 9) and your favorite ingredients form the sequence b_{i1}, b_{i2}, ..., b_{if_i} (1 ≤ b_{it} ≤ 9).

The website of CodePizza restaurant has exactly m (m ≥ 2) pizzas. Each pizza is characterized by a set of r_j ingredients a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ..., a_{jr_j} (1 ≤ r_j ≤ 9, 1 ≤ a_{jt} ≤ 9) , which are included in it, and its price is c_j.

Help your friends choose exactly two pizzas in such a way as to please the maximum number of people in the company. It is known that a person is pleased with the choice if each of his/her favorite ingredients is in at least one ordered pizza. If there are several ways to choose two pizzas so as to please the maximum number of friends, then choose the one that minimizes the total price of two pizzas.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of friends in the company and the number of pizzas, respectively.

Next, the n lines contain descriptions of favorite ingredients of the friends: the i-th of them contains the number of favorite ingredients f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 9) and a sequence of distinct integers b_{i1}, b_{i2}, ..., b_{if_i} (1 ≤ b_{it} ≤ 9).

Next, the m lines contain pizza descriptions: the j-th of them contains the integer price of the pizza c_j (1 ≤ c_j ≤ 10^9), the number of ingredients r_j (1 ≤ r_j ≤ 9) and the ingredients themselves as a sequence of distinct integers a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ..., a_{jr_j} (1 ≤ a_{jt} ≤ 9).

Output

Output two integers j_1 and j_2 (1 ≤ j_1,j_2 ≤ m, j_1 ≠ j_2) denoting the indices of two pizzas in the required set. If there are several solutions, output any of them. Pizza indices can be printed in any order.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
