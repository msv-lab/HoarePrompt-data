Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility that the minimum product might involve more than two identical smallest elements in the array. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
6
1 1 1 2 2 3
```

The correct output should be 4, because the minimum product \(1 \times 1 \times 1\) can be formed by choosing any three of the three '1's. However, the provided program will only count the occurrences of the third smallest element (which is 2 in this case), leading to an incorrect output.
