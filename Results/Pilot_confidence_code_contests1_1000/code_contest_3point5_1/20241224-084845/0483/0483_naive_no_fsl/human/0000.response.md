Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for papering the walls. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine the number of rolls needed for each room. The formula used to calculate the number of rolls (`w[C] * ((r[P] + wpw - 1) / wpw)`) is incorrect because it does not properly account for the fact that each roll can be cut into multiple strips and the number of strips per roll is determined by the height of the wall and the width of the wallpaper.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5 3
3
10 1 100
15 2 320
3 19 500
```

- The perimeter of the room is 20 meters.
- The first type of wallpaper can be cut into 1-meter wide strips, so 7 rolls are needed, costing 700.
- The second type of wallpaper can be cut into 2-meter wide strips, so 2 rolls are needed, costing 640.
- The third type of wallpaper can cover 19 meters out of 20, so 2 rolls are needed, costing 1000.

The program outputs 640, which is correct for the second type of wallpaper. However, it fails to consider the optimal use of the third type of wallpaper, which would result in a lower cost. The program incorrectly calculates the number of rolls needed and thus does not always find the minimum cost.
