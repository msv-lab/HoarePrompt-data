You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's another Start[c]up, and that means there are T-shirts to order. In order to make sure T-shirts are shipped as soon as possible, we've decided that this year we're going to order all of the necessary T-shirts before the actual competition. The top C contestants are going to be awarded T-shirts, but we obviously don't know which contestants that will be. The plan is to get the T-Shirt sizes of all contestants before the actual competition, and then order enough T-shirts so that no matter who is in the top C we'll have T-shirts available in order to award them.

In order to get the T-shirt sizes of the contestants, we will send out a survey. The survey will allow contestants to either specify a single desired T-shirt size, or two adjacent T-shirt sizes. If a contestant specifies two sizes, it means that they can be awarded either size.

As you can probably tell, this plan could require ordering a lot of unnecessary T-shirts. We'd like your help to determine the minimum number of T-shirts we'll need to order to ensure that we'll be able to award T-shirts no matter the outcome of the competition.

Input

Input will begin with two integers N and C (1 ≤ N ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ C), the number of T-shirt sizes and number of T-shirts to be awarded, respectively.

Following this is a line with 2·N - 1 integers, s1 through s2·N - 1 (0 ≤ si ≤ 108). For odd i, si indicates the number of contestants desiring T-shirt size ((i + 1) / 2). For even i, si indicates the number of contestants okay receiving either of T-shirt sizes (i / 2) and (i / 2 + 1). C will not exceed the total number of contestants.

Output

Print the minimum number of T-shirts we need to buy.

Examples

Input

2 200
100 250 100


Output

200


Input

4 160
88 69 62 29 58 52 44


Output

314

Note

In the first example, we can buy 100 of each size.
Program:
```
from sys import*
from itertools import*

func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, c) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    s = map(int, stdin.readline().split(), repeat(10, 2 * n - 1))
    l = len(s)
    st = min(c, s[0])
    ss = s[0]
    ans = st
    q = deque([(s[0], st)])
    for i in xrange(2, l, 2):
        q.append(s[i - 1])
        ss += s[i] + s[i - 1]
        while len(q) > 2:
            z = q[-1]
            (x, y) = q[-2]
            if x + z - y <= 0:
                q.pop()
                q.pop()
                q[-2] = (q[-2][0] + x + z, q[-2][1] + y)
            else:
                break
        bt = min(ss, c) - st
        while ss > c and q:
            (x, y) = q.popleft()
            ss -= x
            st -= y
            x = q.popleft()
            ss -= x
        z = min(ss, c) - st
        if bt < z:
            bt = z
        if bt < 0:
            bt = 0
        st += bt
        q.append((s[i], bt))
        ans += bt
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
