Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of T-shirt sizes specified for two adjacent sizes exceeds the number of contestants who are okay with either size. This can lead to an underestimation of the required number of T-shirts.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 160
88 69 62 29 58 52 44
```

The program's output is `314`, but the correct answer should be `321`.

Hereâ€™s why:
- The number of contestants who can take either size 2 or size 3 is 58.
- The number of contestants who want size 2 is 62.
- The number of contestants who want size 3 is 44.

The sum of contestants who can take either size 2 or size 3 plus those who want size 2 is \(62 + 58 + 44 = 164\). Since we only have 160 contestants, we need to account for the extra 4 contestants who want size 2 but are also okay with size 3.

The correct calculation should be:
- Minimum T-shirts needed for size 2: \( \max(62, 160 - 58) = 102 \)
- Minimum T-shirts needed for size 3: \( \max(44, 160 - 62) = 98 \)

Thus, the total is \(102 + 98 = 200\).

However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
