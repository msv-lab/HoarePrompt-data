Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the client's requirements can be met by painting fewer rows or columns than the current logic allows. Specifically, the program always tries to fill the board row by row and then column by column, which might not yield the minimum number of strokes.

Consider the following input:

```
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
WWWWWWWW
WWWWWWWW
```

In this case, the optimal solution would be to paint just one row or one column black, resulting in only 1 stroke. However, the current implementation will count 2 strokes (one for each row or column that is fully black). This is because the program first checks for fully black rows and counts them, and then it checks for columns, leading to an overestimation of the required strokes.
