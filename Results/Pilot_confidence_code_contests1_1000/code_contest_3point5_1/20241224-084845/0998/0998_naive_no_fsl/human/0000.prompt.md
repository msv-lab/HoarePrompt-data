You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Phoenix has n coins with weights 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^n. He knows that n is even.

He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly n/2 coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is minimized. Formally, let a denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and b denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize |a-b|, the absolute value of a-b.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30; n is even) — the number of coins that Phoenix has. 

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum possible difference of weights between the two piles.

Example

Input


2
2
4


Output


2
6

Note

In the first test case, Phoenix has two coins with weights 2 and 4. No matter how he divides the coins, the difference will be 4-2=2.

In the second test case, Phoenix has four coins of weight 2, 4, 8, and 16. It is optimal for Phoenix to place coins with weights 2 and 16 in one pile, and coins with weights 4 and 8 in another pile. The difference is (2+16)-(4+8)=6.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
range = xrange
temp = [2 ** i for i in range(31)]
for t in range(input()):
    n = input()
    ans = 2
    n /= 2
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans += 2 * temp[i]
    func_3(ans)

def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())

def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
