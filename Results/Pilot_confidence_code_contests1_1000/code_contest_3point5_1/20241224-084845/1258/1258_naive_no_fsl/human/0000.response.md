Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Modular Arithmetic Handling**: The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is necessary due to the constraints (e.g., \(10^9 + 9\)).

2. **Periodic Sequence Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the sum of the series using the periodic property of the sequence. It iterates through the first \(k\) elements and extends the sum to the full length \(n\) using the periodicity.

3. **Geometric Series Summation**: The `period_pow` function correctly computes the sum of the geometric series using the periodic property, which is crucial for optimizing the computation when \(k\) divides \(n+1\).

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles different inputs correctly. For example:
   - When \(n = 2\), \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(k = 3\), and the sequence is `+-+`, the output is 7.
   - When \(n = 4\), \(a = 1\), \(b = 5\), \(k = 1\), and the sequence is `-`, the output is 999999228.

Given the problem constraints and examples, the program appears to be correct in handling all potential cases. There are no apparent logical flaws or missing edge cases that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description.
