You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers a and b. Moreover, you are given a sequence s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n}. All values in s are integers 1 or -1. It's known that sequence is k-periodic and k divides n+1. In other words, for each k ≤ i ≤ n it's satisfied that s_{i} = s_{i - k}.

Find out the non-negative remainder of division of ∑ _{i=0}^{n} s_{i} a^{n - i} b^{i} by 10^{9} + 9.

Note that the modulo is unusual!

Input

The first line contains four integers n, a, b and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{9}, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{5}).

The second line contains a sequence of length k consisting of characters '+' and '-'. 

If the i-th character (0-indexed) is '+', then s_{i} = 1, otherwise s_{i} = -1.

Note that only the first k members of the sequence are given, the rest can be obtained using the periodicity property.

Output

Output a single integer — value of given expression modulo 10^{9} + 9.

Output

999999228

Note

In the first example:

(∑ _{i=0}^{n} s_{i} a^{n - i} b^{i}) = 2^{2} 3^{0} - 2^{1} 3^{1} + 2^{0} 3^{2} = 7

In the second example:

(∑ _{i=0}^{n} s_{i} a^{n - i} b^{i}) = -1^{4} 5^{0} - 1^{3} 5^{1} - 1^{2} 5^{2} - 1^{1} 5^{3} - 1^{0} 5^{4} = -781 ≡ 999999228 \pmod{10^{9} + 9}.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    period_pow = lambda r1, r2, n, x: div(add(pow(r2, (x + 1) * n, mod), -pow(r1, (x + 1) * n, mod)), add(mult(pow(r2, n, mod), pow(r1, x * n, mod)), -pow(r1, n * (x + 1), mod)))
    add = lambda a, b: (a + b) % mod
    mult = lambda a, b: a * b % mod
    div = lambda a, b: mult(a, inv(b))
    inv = lambda a: pow(a, mod - 2, mod)
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 9
    (n, a, b, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    (s, su) = (stdin.readline().strip(), 0)
    for (i, j) in enumerate(s):
        cur = mult(pow(a, n - i, mod), pow(b, i, mod))
        if j == '-':
            cur *= -1
        su = add(su, cur)
    geo = period_pow(a, b, k, (n + 1) // k - 1)
    print(mult(su, geo))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
