Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to incrementally multiply `n` towards `m` using a while loop, but it does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially when `n` and `m` have different prime factorizations.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
48 72
```

In this case, the program will attempt to transform `48` to `72` by multiplying with `2` and `3`. However, the program's logic for deciding whether to multiply by `2` or `3` inside the while loop is flawed. It checks divisibility by `6` in an incorrect manner, leading to an incorrect number of moves or an incorrect result.

A correct approach would involve finding the minimum number of operations required to reach `m` from `n` by leveraging the properties of logarithms or by directly checking the factors of `m` and `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if n == m:
        print(0)
    elif m % n != 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        moves = 0
        while m > n:
            if m % 2 == 0:
                m //= 2
            elif m % 3 == 0:
                m //= 3
            else:
                print(-1)
                return
            moves += 1
        if m == n:
            print(moves)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all cases and calculates the minimum number of moves needed to transform `n` to `m`.
