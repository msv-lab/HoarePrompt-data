You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number n and his goal is to transform it to m. In one move, he can multiply n by 2 or multiply n by 3. He can perform any number of moves.

Print the number of moves needed to transform n to m. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.

It is easy to prove that any way to transform n to m contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 5⋅10^8).

Output

Print the number of moves to transform n to m, or -1 if there is no solution.

Examples

Input


120 51840


Output


7


Input


42 42


Output


0


Input


48 72


Output


-1

Note

In the first example, the possible sequence of moves is: 120 → 240 → 720 → 1440 → 4320 → 12960 → 25920 → 51840. The are 7 steps in total.

In the second example, no moves are needed. Thus, the answer is 0.

In the third example, it is impossible to transform 48 to 72.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    quant = 0
    cont = 0
    if n == m:
        print(0)
    elif m % n == 0 and (m % 2 == 0 or m % 3 == 0 or m % 6):
        while True:
            if m % 6 == 0:
                if quant % 2 == 0:
                    n *= 2
                else:
                    n *= 3
                quant += 1
            elif m % 2 == 0:
                n *= 2
            else:
                n *= 3
            cont += 1
            if n >= m:
                break
        if n == m:
            print(cont)
        else:
            print(-1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
