Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to factorize the given number `n` by computing square roots of random numbers and checking for potential factors. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Use of `sqrt` Operation**: The program prints `sqrt %s` with `x * x % n`, which is essentially asking for the square root of `x^2 % n`. This will always result in `x` itself or `n - x`, but it does not provide useful information for factorization unless `x` is a non-trivial factor of `n`. 

2. **Incorrect Handling of Potential Factors**: After computing the square roots, the program checks if the result is `x` or `n - x`. If neither is true, it calls `func_1` with the sum of `x` and the result of the square root operation. This function, however, is not defined in the program, and even if it were, it would not be correctly used for factorization.

3. **Incomplete Factorization Logic**: The program tries to find factors by repeatedly updating a list `t` and checking for non-trivial factors. However, it does not ensure that the factors found are indeed prime and of the form `4x + 3`. Additionally, the logic to find and verify these factors is incomplete and relies on assumptions that are not justified by the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly factorize the number `n` according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
