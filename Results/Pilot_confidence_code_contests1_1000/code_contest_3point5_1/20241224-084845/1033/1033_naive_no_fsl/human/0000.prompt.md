You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are famous Russian nesting dolls named matryoshkas sold in one of the souvenir stores nearby, and you'd like to buy several of them. The store has n different matryoshkas. Any matryoshka is a figure of volume out_i with an empty space inside of volume in_i (of course, out_i > in_i).

You don't have much free space inside your bag, but, fortunately, you know that matryoshkas can be nested one inside another. Formally, let's call a set of matryoshkas nested if we can rearrange dolls in such a way, that the first doll can be nested inside the second one, the second doll — inside the third one and so on. Matryoshka i can be nested inside matryoshka j if out_i ≤ in_j. So only the last doll will take space inside your bag.

Let's call extra space of a nested set of dolls as a total volume of empty space inside this structure. Obviously, it's equal to in_{i_1} + (in_{i_2} - out_{i_1}) + (in_{i_3} - out_{i_2}) + ... + (in_{i_k} - out_{i_{k-1}}), where i_1, i_2, ..., i_k are the indices of the chosen dolls in the order they are nested in each other.

Finally, let's call a nested subset of the given sequence as big enough if there isn't any doll from the sequence that can be added to the nested subset without breaking its nested property.

You want to buy many matryoshkas, so you should choose a big enough nested subset to buy it. But you will be disappointed if too much space in your bag will be wasted, so you want to choose a big enough subset so that its extra space is minimum possible among all big enough subsets. Now you wonder, how many different nested subsets meet these conditions (they are big enough, and there is no big enough subset such that its extra space is less than the extra space of the chosen subset). Two subsets are considered different if there exists at least one index i such that one of the subsets contains the i-th doll, and another subset doesn't.

Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas.

The next n lines contain a description of each doll: two integers out_i and in_i (1 ≤ in_i < out_i ≤ 10^9) — the outer and inners volumes of the i-th matryoshka.

Output

Print one integer — the number of big enough nested subsets such that extra space of each of these subsets is minimum possible. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input


7
4 1
4 2
4 2
2 1
5 4
6 4
3 2


Output


6

Note

There are 6 big enough nested subsets with minimum possible extra space in the example: 

  * \{1, 5\}: we can't add any other matryoshka and keep it nested; it's extra space is 1; 
  * \{1, 6\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 6\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 6\}. 



There are no more "good" subsets because, for example, subset \{6, 7\} is not big enough (we can add the 4-th matryoshka to it) or subset \{4, 6, 7\} has extra space equal to 2.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
