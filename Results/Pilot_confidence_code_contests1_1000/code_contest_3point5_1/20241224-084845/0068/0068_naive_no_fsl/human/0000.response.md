Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for certain cases. Specifically, the program uses a ternary search to find the optimal value of \( x \) but it seems to miss some edge cases or has an issue with the implementation.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
-1 -2 -3
```

#### Expected Output:
The optimal value of \( x \) should be \(-2\). The sequence becomes \(-1 - (-2) = 1\), \(-2 - (-2) = 0\), \(-3 - (-2) = -1\). The maximum poorness is \( |1 - 0| = 1 \).

#### Actual Output:
The program might output a different value due to the way it handles the ternary search or the calculation of poorness.

### Reasoning:
1. **Ternary Search Implementation**: The program uses a ternary search to find the optimal \( x \). However, the ternary search might not converge correctly in some scenarios, especially when the sequence values are negative and close to each other.
2. **Poorness Calculation**: The poorness calculation might be incorrect or not robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly when dealing with negative numbers and their sums.

Given the above points, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the output is incorrect for some inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
