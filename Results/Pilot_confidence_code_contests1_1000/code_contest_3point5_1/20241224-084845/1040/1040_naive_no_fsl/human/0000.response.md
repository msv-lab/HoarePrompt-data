Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where Alice and Bob are in a cycle and the distances allow them to meet within the given constraints.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 1 5 2 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

In this case, the tree forms a linear structure where Alice starts at vertex 1 and Bob at vertex 5. Both Alice and Bob have a maximum jumping distance of 2. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Initial Positions**: Alice at 1, Bob at 5.
2. **First Move by Alice**: Alice can jump to vertex 2 (distance 1).
3. **First Move by Bob**: Bob can jump to vertex 4 (distance 1).
4. **Second Move by Alice**: Alice can jump to vertex 3 (distance 1).
5. **Second Move by Bob**: Bob can jump to vertex 3 (distance 1).

After these moves, Alice and Bob are both at vertex 3, which means Alice wins. However, the provided program does not handle this scenario correctly. It uses a BFS approach to determine the maximum distance from the starting points and does not fully consider the cyclic nature of paths in trees.

To fix this, the program needs to properly check if Alice and Bob can meet within the given constraints, especially considering the cyclic nature of paths in trees. The current implementation may miss some critical cases where Alice and Bob can meet within the allowed number of moves.
