Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum energy required to collect all items by alternating between picking from the left and right sides, with appropriate handling of the extra energy costs for consecutive picks from the same side. The `func_1` function correctly evaluates the minimum energy cost based on the initial choice (either starting with the left or right side). Given the constraints and examples, the program appears to handle all potential cases as expected. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the current implementation fails to address.
