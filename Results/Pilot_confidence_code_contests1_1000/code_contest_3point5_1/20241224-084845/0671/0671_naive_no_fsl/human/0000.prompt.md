You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n items lying in a line. The items are consecutively numbered by numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the leftmost item has number 1, the rightmost item has number n. Each item has a weight, the i-th item weights wi kilograms.

Vasya needs to collect all these items, however he won't do it by himself. He uses his brand new robot. The robot has two different arms — the left one and the right one. The robot can consecutively perform the following actions: 

  1. Take the leftmost item with the left hand and spend wi · l energy units (wi is a weight of the leftmost item, l is some parameter). If the previous action was the same (left-hand), then the robot spends extra Ql energy units; 
  2. Take the rightmost item with the right hand and spend wj · r energy units (wj is a weight of the rightmost item, r is some parameter). If the previous action was the same (right-hand), then the robot spends extra Qr energy units; 



Naturally, Vasya wants to program the robot in a way that the robot spends as little energy as possible. He asked you to solve this problem. Your task is to find the minimum number of energy units robot spends to collect all items.

Input

The first line contains five integers n, l, r, Ql, Qr (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ l, r ≤ 100; 1 ≤ Ql, Qr ≤ 104).

The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).

Output

In the single line print a single number — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

3 4 4 19 1
42 3 99


Output

576


Input

4 7 2 3 9
1 2 3 4


Output

34

Note

Consider the first sample. As l = r, we can take an item in turns: first from the left side, then from the right one and last item from the left. In total the robot spends 4·42 + 4·99 + 4·3 = 576 energy units.

The second sample. The optimal solution is to take one item from the right, then one item from the left and two items from the right. In total the robot spends (2·4) + (7·1) + (2·3) + (2·2 + 9) = 34 energy units.
Program:
```
import sys

inp = [map(int, i.split(' ')) for i in sys.stdin.read().splitlines()]
(n, L, R, QL, QR) = inp[0]
w = inp[1]
res = min(func_1(0), func_1(1))
sys.stdout.write(str(res))

def func_1(f):
    global L, R, QL, QR, w
    ret = 0
    (l, r) = (0, len(w))
    action = None
    while l != r:
        cost_l = w[l] * L + (QL if action == 0 else 0)
        cost_r = w[r - 1] * R + (QR if action == 1 else 0)
        if action is not None:
            if cost_l < cost_r:
                action = 0
            elif cost_l > cost_r:
                action = 1
        else:
            action = f
        if action == 0:
            ret += cost_l
            l += 1
        else:
            ret += cost_r
            r -= 1
    return ret


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
