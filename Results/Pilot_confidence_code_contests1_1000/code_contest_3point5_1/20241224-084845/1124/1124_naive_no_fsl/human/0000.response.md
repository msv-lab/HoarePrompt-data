Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are banned cells on the edges or corners of the board. Specifically, the program assumes that no banned cells exist on the border cells except the corners, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 2
```
In this case, the banned cell is (2, 2). According to the problem description, Gerald should not be able to place any chips, as the only safe cells are the corners (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). However, the program incorrectly allows placing a chip on (1, 2) or (2, 1), leading to a loss since the chip will eventually fall into the banned cell (2, 2).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that no banned cells exist on any of the border cells except the corners. This can be done by checking and marking the border cells appropriately before counting the possible chip placements.
