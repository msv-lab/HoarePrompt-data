You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a square matrix consisting of n rows and n columns. We assume that the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Some cells (n - 1 cells in total) of the the matrix are filled with ones, the remaining cells are filled with zeros. We can apply the following operations to the matrix:

  1. Swap i-th and j-th rows of the matrix; 
  2. Swap i-th and j-th columns of the matrix. 



You are asked to transform the matrix into a special form using these operations. In that special form all the ones must be in the cells that lie below the main diagonal. Cell of the matrix, which is located on the intersection of the i-th row and of the j-th column, lies below the main diagonal if i > j.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns. Then follow n - 1 lines that contain one's positions, one per line. Each position is described by two integers xk, yk (1 ≤ xk, yk ≤ n), separated by a space. A pair (xk, yk) means that the cell, which is located on the intersection of the xk-th row and of the yk-th column, contains one.

It is guaranteed that all positions are distinct.

Output

Print the description of your actions. These actions should transform the matrix to the described special form.

In the first line you should print a non-negative integer m (m ≤ 105) — the number of actions. In each of the next m lines print three space-separated integers t, i, j (1 ≤ t ≤ 2, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j), where t = 1 if you want to swap rows, t = 2 if you want to swap columns, and i and j denote the numbers of rows or columns respectively.

Please note, that you do not need to minimize the number of operations, but their number should not exceed 105. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them.

    except:
        break
    s[i][j] = 1
begin = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if s[i].count(1) < begin:
        func_1(1, i, begin)
        begin += 1
for i in range(n, 1, -1):
    if s[i][i]:
        func_1(2, i, i - 1)
print(len(counts))
for i in counts:
    print(*i)

def func_1(n, i, j):
    if i == j:
        return
    global counts
    global s
    counts.append((n, i, j))
    if n == 1:
        (s[i], s[j]) = (s[j], s[i])
        return
    for k in range(1, len(s)):
        (s[k][i], s[k][j]) = (s[k][j], s[k][i])

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
