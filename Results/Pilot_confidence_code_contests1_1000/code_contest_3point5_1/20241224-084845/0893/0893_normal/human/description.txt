Takahashi, Aoki and Snuke love cookies. They have A, B and C cookies, respectively. Now, they will exchange those cookies by repeating the action below:

* Each person simultaneously divides his cookies in half and gives one half to each of the other two persons.



This action will be repeated until there is a person with odd number of cookies in hand.

How many times will they repeat this action? Note that the answer may not be finite.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 10^9
