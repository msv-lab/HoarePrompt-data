Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in its implementation. The program uses integer division (`//`), which truncates the decimal part. However, the problem description implies that the cookies are divided in such a way that the result should be a floating-point number, effectively rounding down to the nearest integer. This means that the current implementation might not correctly handle cases where the number of cookies needs to be halved and rounded down.

For example, consider the input `2 2 2`. According to the problem description, each person would give half of their cookies to the others, resulting in:

- A gives 1 cookie to B and 1 cookie to C, so A now has 0 cookies.
- B gives 1 cookie to A and 1 cookie to C, so B now has 0 cookies.
- C gives 1 cookie to A and 1 cookie to B, so C now has 0 cookies.

After the first exchange, A, B, and C would each have 1 cookie, making the total number of cookies odd. However, the program would continue the loop without checking if the total number of cookies is odd, leading to an incorrect output of `0` instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the program should use floating-point division to ensure that the cookies are correctly halved and the total number of cookies is checked properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(float, input().split())
    steps = 0
    while a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and c % 2 == 0:
        a, b, c = b / 2 + c / 2, a / 2 + c / 2, a / 2 + b / 2
        steps += 1
    if a % 2 == 1 or b % 2 == 1 or c % 2 == 1:
        print(steps)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly.
