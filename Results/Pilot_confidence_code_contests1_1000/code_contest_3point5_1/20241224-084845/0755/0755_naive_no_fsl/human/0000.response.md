Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the seating and disembarking process according to the given problem description. Specifically, the logic for assigning seats and handling the different types of seats (window and non-window) is flawed.

For instance, consider the case when `n = 2` and `m = 7`. According to the problem description, the sequence of seat occupation and disembarkation should be as follows:

1. Left window seat: Passenger 1
2. Right window seat: Passenger 2
3. Left window seat: Passenger 3
4. Right window seat: Passenger 4
5. Left non-window seat: Passenger 5
6. Right non-window seat: Passenger 6
7. Right non-window seat: Passenger 7

However, the provided program outputs:

```
5 1 6 2 7 3 4
```

This output is incorrect because Passenger 1 should have taken the 1st row left window seat, not the 5th position. Similarly, Passenger 2 should have taken the 1st row right window seat, but the program places them in the 1st position. This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the seating and disembarking order, leading to an incorrect output.
