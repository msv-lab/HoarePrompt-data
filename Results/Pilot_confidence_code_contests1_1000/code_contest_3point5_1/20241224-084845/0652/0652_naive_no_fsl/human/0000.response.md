Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimal area of the rectangle that could contain all the points. Specifically, the function `func_2` and the overall logic do not correctly determine the minimum possible area.

Here’s a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

### Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
4
4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3
```

According to the problem description, the stars in Pavel's records can be at coordinates \((1, 3)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 3)\), \((2, 4)\). The minimal area of the rectangle that can contain these points is \(1\) (with corners at \((1, 3)\) and \((2, 4)\)).

However, the current implementation of the program does not handle this correctly. Let’s walk through the program step-by-step:

1. The program reads the input and sorts the coordinates.
2. It then iterates over possible shifts and computes the area for each shifted version of the coordinates.
3. The smallest computed area is taken as the result.

Given the input:
- The sorted coordinates are \([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\).
- For each shift, the program computes the area using `func_2`.

For instance, when shift is 0:
- `min_x = 1`, `max_x = 2`
- `min_y = 3`, `max_y = 4`
- Area = \(|2 - 1| \times |4 - 3| = 1\)

This seems correct, but the issue arises when considering other shifts. For example, when shift is 1:
- `min_x = 1`, `max_x = 2`
- `min_y = 2`, `max_y = 3`
- Area = \(|2 - 1| \times |3 - 2| = 1\)

However, the minimal area should be computed by considering the actual coordinates without shifting. The correct approach should directly find the minimum and maximum x and y values from the sorted list.

A corrected version of the program would be:
```python
import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
ar = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

ar.sort()

min_x = ar[0]
max_x = ar[n]
min_y = ar[n // 2]
max_y = ar[n // 2 + n - 1]

area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)
print(area)
```

This version correctly finds the minimum and maximum x and y values from the sorted list and calculates the area accordingly.
