You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel made a photo of his favourite stars in the sky. His camera takes a photo of all points of the sky that belong to some rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Strictly speaking, it makes a photo of all points with coordinates (x, y), such that x_1 ≤ x ≤ x_2 and y_1 ≤ y ≤ y_2, where (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) are coordinates of the left bottom and the right top corners of the rectangle being photographed. The area of this rectangle can be zero.

After taking the photo, Pavel wrote down coordinates of n of his favourite stars which appeared in the photo. These points are not necessarily distinct, there can be multiple stars in the same point of the sky.

Pavel has lost his camera recently and wants to buy a similar one. Specifically, he wants to know the dimensions of the photo he took earlier. Unfortunately, the photo is also lost. His notes are also of not much help; numbers are written in random order all over his notepad, so it's impossible to tell which numbers specify coordinates of which points.

Pavel asked you to help him to determine what are the possible dimensions of the photo according to his notes. As there are multiple possible answers, find the dimensions with the minimal possible area of the rectangle.

Input

The first line of the input contains an only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), the number of points in Pavel's records.

The second line contains 2 ⋅ n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2 ⋅ n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), coordinates, written by Pavel in some order.

Output

Print the only integer, the minimal area of the rectangle which could have contained all points from Pavel's records.

Examples

Input

4
4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3


Output

1

Input

3
5 8 5 5 7 5


Output

0

Note

In the first sample stars in Pavel's records can be (1, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4). In this case, the minimal area of the rectangle, which contains all these points is 1 (rectangle with corners at (1, 3) and (2, 4)).
Program:
```
import sys

n = sys.stdin.readline()
n = int(n)
ar = sys.stdin.readline()
ar = ar.split()
ar = [int(a) for a in ar if a and len(a) > 0]
func_1(n, ar)

def func_1(n, a):
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    l = len(a)
    a.sort()
    least = -1
    for shift in range(0, l):
        curr = func_2(a, shift)
        if least == -1 or least > curr:
            least = curr
    print(least)

def func_2(a, s):
    l = len(a)
    min_x = a[s % l]
    max_x = a[(l / 2 - 1 + s) % l]
    min_y = a[(l / 2 + s) % l]
    max_y = a[(l - 1 + s) % l]
    return abs(max_x - min_x) * abs(max_y - min_y)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
