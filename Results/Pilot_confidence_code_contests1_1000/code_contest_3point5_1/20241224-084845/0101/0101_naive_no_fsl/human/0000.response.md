Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After analyzing the provided Python program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the number of ways to choose `k` lamps such that there exists a moment in time when all selected lamps are turned on.

Key points:
1. The program reads input values and processes the intervals for each lamp.
2. It uses dynamic programming techniques to count the number of valid subsets of lamps.
3. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented to handle factorials and cumulative sums, which are essential for combinatorial calculations.
4. The main logic iterates through possible times and uses dynamic programming to count valid combinations of lamps.

Given the structure and the mathematical correctness of the logic, the program should work for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were provided where the program fails, we can conclude that the program is correct.
