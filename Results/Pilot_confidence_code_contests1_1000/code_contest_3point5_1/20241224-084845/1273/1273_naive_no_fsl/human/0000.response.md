Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the selected root vertex satisfies the condition for all vertices in the tree. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following tree with 5 vertices:
```
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
      |
      5
```

For this tree, if we select vertex 2 as the root, the distances and degrees would be:
- Distance(2, 1) = 1, Degree(1) = 1
- Distance(2, 3) = 1, Degree(3) = 2
- Distance(2, 4) = 2, Degree(4) = 1
- Distance(2, 5) = 2, Degree(5) = 1

Here, for vertices with the same distance from the root (distance 1), their degrees are not equal (Degree(1) â‰  Degree(3)). Therefore, vertex 2 does not satisfy the required condition.

The program fails to identify such cases and may incorrectly select vertex 2 as a valid root. This shows that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is False.
