Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of skip points needed. Specifically, the logic for calculating `F` and `M` arrays is flawed. Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
1 0 1 1
```

The expected output should be `1` because:
- Your friend kills the first boss with 1 skip point.
- You kill the second and third bosses.
- Your friend kills the fourth boss without needing additional skip points.

However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. The program fails to handle the case where only one hard boss needs to be skipped, leading to an overestimation of the skip points required.
