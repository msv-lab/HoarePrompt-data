Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the cases where the total number of steps `n` cannot be reached using a combination of 1-step and 2-step moves such that the total number of moves is a multiple of `m`.

For example, consider the input `3 5`. The valid number of moves can be 2 (with the sequence [1, 1]) or 3 (with the sequence [1, 2] or [2, 1]). However, both 2 and 3 are not multiples of 5, so the output should be `-1`. The program incorrectly outputs `2` because it only checks if `t` (which is initially set to `n // 2`) is a multiple of `m`, but it does not ensure that this value of `t` can actually be achieved through a valid sequence of 1-step and 2-step moves.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible combinations of 1-step and 2-step moves to see if a valid sequence exists that results in a number of moves which is a multiple of `m`.
