You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Evlampiy was gifted a rooted tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to n. Each of its vertices also has an integer a_i written on it. For each vertex i, Evlampiy calculated c_i — the number of vertices j in the subtree of vertex i, such that a_j < a_i. 

<image>Illustration for the second example, the first integer is a_i and the integer in parentheses is c_i

After the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of c_i, but he completely forgot which integers a_i were written on the vertices.

Help him to restore initial integers!

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The next n lines contain descriptions of vertices: the i-th line contains two integers p_i and c_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ n; 0 ≤ c_i ≤ n-1), where p_i is the parent of vertex i or 0 if vertex i is root, and c_i is the number of vertices j in the subtree of vertex i, such that a_j < a_i.

It is guaranteed that the values of p_i describe a rooted tree with n vertices.

Output

If a solution exists, in the first line print "YES", and in the second line output n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ {10}^{9}). If there are several solutions, output any of them. One can prove that if there is a solution, then there is also a solution in which all a_i are between 1 and 10^9.

If there are no solutions, print "NO".

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
