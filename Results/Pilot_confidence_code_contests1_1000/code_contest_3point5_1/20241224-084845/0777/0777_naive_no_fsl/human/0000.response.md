Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when dealing with subtrees and the calculation of `c_i`. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
0 3
1 2
1 1
3 0
```

In this case, the tree structure is as follows:
```
      1
     / \
    2   3
       /
      4
```

For this tree, the correct output should be:
```
YES
4 3 2 1
```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output. Specifically, the line `if c[cur] > self.nodes[cur]:` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the values of `a_i` within the subtrees. This condition will likely fail to correctly place the values, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the values placed in the tree satisfy the conditions of `c_i` for each node. The current implementation does not guarantee this, hence it is incorrect.
