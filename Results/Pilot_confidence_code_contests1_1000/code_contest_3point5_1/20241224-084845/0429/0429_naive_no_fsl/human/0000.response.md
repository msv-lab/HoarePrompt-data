Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a graph and then checks which edges are not part of any shortest path. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix, which is appropriate for this problem since the graph is dense and we need to check all pairs of vertices.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: The function `dijkstra` correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path distances from a given source vertex to all other vertices.

3. **Shortest Path Tree Construction**: After computing the shortest paths from each vertex, the program constructs a list of vertices visited during these shortest paths. This helps in identifying edges that are part of some shortest path.

4. **Edge Check**: For each edge in the graph, the program checks whether it appears in the shortest path tree constructed for any vertex. If it does not appear, it counts the edge as one that is not part of any shortest path.

5. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the input in the specified format and prints the output in the required format.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all cases correctly. It does not miss any potential cases and correctly identifies edges that are not part of any shortest path. Therefore, the program is correct.
