Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether the flies see each other based on the problem description. According to the problem, the flies see each other if they lie on the same face of the cube. However, the current implementation checks if the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates is equal to 3, which only indicates that the flies are at opposite vertices of the cube, not on the same face.

For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
```

The flies are on the same face of the cube (the bottom face), but the program will output `NO` because the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates is 1, which does not match the condition `ans == 3`. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.
