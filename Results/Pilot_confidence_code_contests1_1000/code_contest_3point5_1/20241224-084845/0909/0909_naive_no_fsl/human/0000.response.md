Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum power value in `a` is not present in `b`. In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum mana required without considering this critical edge case.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
5 2
5 2 3
3 1 4 5 2
3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
8
```

However, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because the maximum value `5` in `a` is still present in `b`.

Another example where the program fails is:

Input:
```
4 4
2 1 11
1 3 2 4
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

The program correctly outputs `0` because no mana is needed since the sequences are identical.

But for:

Input:
```
4 4
2 1 11
1 3 2 6
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

The program incorrectly outputs a non-negative number or `0` instead of `-1`.

The program should check if the maximum value in `a` is present in `b` before proceeding with the calculations. If the maximum value is not present, it should output `-1` immediately.
