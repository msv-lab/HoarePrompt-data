Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the hash `h` can be formed by shuffling the password `p` and appending some prefix and suffix strings, but it does not fully validate this process.

Consider the following test case:
- Password: `p = "abacaba"`
- Hash: `h = "zyxaabcaabkjh"`

According to the problem description, `p'` can be a shuffled version of `p`, and `h` would be constructed as `s1 + p' + s2`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the characters in `h` can form a shuffled version of `p` by using a counter. It does not account for the presence of additional characters in `s1` and `s2`.

A more comprehensive approach would involve:
1. Checking if the length of `h` is at least as long as `p`.
2. Ensuring that all characters in `p` are present in `h` with the same frequency.
3. Verifying that the characters outside `p` in `h` can form valid `s1` and `s2` such that the shuffled version of `p` fits between them.

The given implementation fails to validate the presence of extra characters that are not part of the shuffled `p`, which can occur in `h`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
