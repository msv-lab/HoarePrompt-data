You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has built his own web service. Being a modern web service it includes login feature. And that always implies password security problems.

Polycarp decided to store the hash of the password, generated by the following algorithm:

  1. take the password p, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and shuffle the letters randomly in it to obtain p' (p' can still be equal to p); 
  2. generate two random strings, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, s_1 and s_2 (any of these strings can be empty); 
  3. the resulting hash h = s_1 + p' + s_2, where addition is string concatenation. 



For example, let the password p = "abacaba". Then p' can be equal to "aabcaab". Random strings s1 = "zyx" and s2 = "kjh". Then h = "zyxaabcaabkjh".

Note that no letters could be deleted or added to p to obtain p', only the order could be changed.

Now Polycarp asks you to help him to implement the password check module. Given the password p and the hash h, check that h can be the hash for the password p.

Your program should answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a non-empty string p, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of p does not exceed 100.

The second line of each test case contains a non-empty string h, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of h does not exceed 100.

Output

For each test case print the answer to it — "YES" if the given hash h could be obtained from the given password p or "NO" otherwise.

Example

Input


5
abacaba
zyxaabcaabkjh
onetwothree
threetwoone
one
zzonneyy
one
none
twenty
ten


Output


YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

Note

The first test case is explained in the statement.

In the second test case both s_1 and s_2 are empty and p'= "threetwoone" is p shuffled.

In the third test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.

In the fourth test case s_1= "n", s_2 is empty and p'= "one" is p shuffled (even thought it stayed the same). 

In the fifth test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.
Program:
```
import collections

for _ in range(int(raw_input())):
    (p, h) = (raw_input(), raw_input())
    print('Yes' if func_1(p, h) else 'No').upper()

def func_1(p, h):
    cc = collections.Counter(p)
    if len(h) < len(p):
        return False
    k = len(cc)
    for (i, e) in enumerate(h):
        if e in cc:
            cc[e] -= 1
            if cc[e] == 0:
                k -= 1
        if i - len(p) >= 0:
            if h[i - len(p)] in cc:
                cc[h[i - len(p)]] += 1
                if cc[h[i - len(p)]] > 0:
                    k += 1
        if k == 0:
            return True
    return False


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
