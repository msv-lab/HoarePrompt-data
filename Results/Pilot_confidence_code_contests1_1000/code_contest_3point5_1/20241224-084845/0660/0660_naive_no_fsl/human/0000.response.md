Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an ebne number for all cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle cases where the number is already ebne or where multiple deletions are required to form an ebne number correctly.

Consider the input `222373204424185217171912`. According to the problem description, one possible ebne number is `2237344218521717191`, which involves multiple deletions. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not ensure that all necessary deletions are made to achieve an ebne number. 

For instance, the function may prematurely return a number that is not fully optimized for being an ebne number, or it may not handle cases where the number needs to be significantly altered to meet the criteria. The current approach only checks for the first occurrence of an odd digit to remove, which might not always result in the correct ebne number.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as iterating through all possible combinations of deletions or ensuring that the sum of the remaining digits is divisible by 2 while maintaining the condition that the number itself is not divisible by 2.
