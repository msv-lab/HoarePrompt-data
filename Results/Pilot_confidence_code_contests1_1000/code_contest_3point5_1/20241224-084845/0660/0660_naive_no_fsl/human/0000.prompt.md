You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a number ebne (even but not even) if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by 2 but the number itself is not divisible by 2. For example, 13, 1227, 185217 are ebne numbers, while 12, 2, 177013, 265918 are not. If you're still unsure what ebne numbers are, you can look at the sample notes for more clarification.

You are given a non-negative integer s, consisting of n digits. You can delete some digits (they are not necessary consecutive/successive) to make the given number ebne. You cannot change the order of the digits, that is, after deleting the digits the remaining digits collapse. The resulting number shouldn't contain leading zeros. You can delete any number of digits between 0 (do not delete any digits at all) and n-1.

For example, if you are given s=222373204424185217171912 then one of possible ways to make it ebne is: 222373204424185217171912 → 2237344218521717191. The sum of digits of 2237344218521717191 is equal to 70 and is divisible by 2, but number itself is not divisible by 2: it means that the resulting number is ebne.

Find any resulting number that is ebne. If it's impossible to create an ebne number from the given number report about it.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of digits in the original number.

The second line of each test case contains a non-negative integer number s, consisting of n digits.

It is guaranteed that s does not contain leading zeros and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3000.

Output

For each test case given in the input print the answer in the following format:

  * If it is impossible to create an ebne number, print "-1" (without quotes);
  * Otherwise, print the resulting number after deleting some, possibly zero, but not all digits. This number should be ebne. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. Note that answers with leading zeros or empty strings are not accepted. It's not necessary to minimize or maximize the number of deleted digits.

Example

Input

1227
1

6
177013
24
222373204424185217171912


Output


1227
-1
17703
2237344218521717191

Note

In the first test case of the example, 1227 is already an ebne number (as 1 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 12, 12 is divisible by 2, while in the same time, 1227 is not divisible by 2) so we don't need to delete any digits. Answers such as 127 and 17 will also be accepted.

In the second test case of the example, it is clearly impossible to create an ebne number from the given number.

In the third test case of the example, there are many ebne numbers we can obtain by deleting, for example, 1 digit such as 17703, 77013 or 17013. Answers such as 1701 or 770 will not be accepted as they are not ebne numbers. Answer 013 will not be accepted as it contains leading zeroes.

Explanation:

  * 1 + 7 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 18. As 18 is divisible by 2 while 17703 is not divisible by 2, we can see that 17703 is an ebne number. Same with 77013 and 17013;
  * 1 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 9. Because 9 is not divisible by 2, 1701 is not an ebne number;
  * 7 + 7 + 0 = 14. This time, 14 is divisible by 2 but 770 is also divisible by 2, therefore, 770 is not an ebne number.



In the last test case of the example, one of many other possible answers is given. Another possible answer is: 222373204424185217171912 → 22237320442418521717191 (delete the last digit).
Program:
```
num = int(input('n of test'))
ebnes = []
for i in range(num):
    dig = input('digits')
    n = input('number')
    ebnes.append(int(n))
for i in ebnes:
    print(func_2(i))

def func_1(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    if sum([int(i) for i in str(n)]) % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def func_2(n):
    if all((int(i) % 2 == 0 for i in str(n))):
        return -1
    if func_1(n):
        return n
    else:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for i in range(len(str(n)) - 1, -1, -1):
                if int(str(n)[i]) % 2 == 0:
                    n = int(str(n)[0:len(str(n)) - 1])
                else:
                    break
        else:
            for i in range(1, 10, 2):
                if str(i) in str(n):
                    n = int(str(n).replace(str(i), '', 1))
                    break
        return func_2(n)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
