Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm correctly for finding the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\). However, the issue lies in the way it handles the minimization of \(|x| + |y|\) and ensuring \(x \leq y\). 

The program attempts to adjust \(x\) and \(y\) to minimize \(|x| + |y|\) and ensure \(x \leq y\) by incrementing or decrementing them in steps of \(dx\) and \(dy\). However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution, especially for certain values of \(a\) and \(b\).

For example, consider the input \(a = 5\), \(b = 7\):

- The output should be \((-2, 2)\) since \(-2 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 7 = 9\) and \(|-2| + |2| = 4\).
- However, the program might output \((2, -2)\) instead because it follows a specific adjustment pattern that might not always yield the optimal solution.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not guarantee the correct minimization of \(|x| + |y|\) and the condition \(x \leq y\) in all cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
