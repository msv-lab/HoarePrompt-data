You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Oleg the bank client checks share prices every day. There are n share prices he is interested in. Today he observed that each second exactly one of these prices decreases by k rubles (note that each second exactly one price changes, but at different seconds different prices can change). Prices can become negative. Oleg found this process interesting, and he asked Igor the financial analyst, what is the minimum time needed for all n prices to become equal, or it is impossible at all? Igor is busy right now, so he asked you to help Oleg. Can you answer this question?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109) — the number of share prices, and the amount of rubles some price decreases each second.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the initial prices.

Output

Print the only line containing the minimum number of seconds needed for prices to become equal, of «-1» if it is impossible.

Examples

Input

3 3
12 9 15


Output

Input

2 2
10 9


Output

-1

Input

4 1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000


Output

2999999997

Note

Consider the first example. 

Suppose the third price decreases in the first second and become equal 12 rubles, then the first price decreases and becomes equal 9 rubles, and in the third second the third price decreases again and becomes equal 9 rubles. In this case all prices become equal 9 rubles in 3 seconds.

There could be other possibilities, but this minimizes the time needed for all prices to become equal. Thus the answer is 3.

In the second example we can notice that parity of first and second price is different and never changes within described process. Thus prices never can become equal.

In the third example following scenario can take place: firstly, the second price drops, then the third price, and then fourth price. It happens 999999999 times, and, since in one second only one price can drop, the whole process takes 999999999 * 3 = 2999999997 seconds. We can note that this is the minimum possible time.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    all = map(int, raw_input().split())
    minn = min(all)
    fail = False
    amount = 0
    for i in all:
        if (i - minn) % k != 0:
            fail = True
        else:
            amount += (i - minn) / k
    if fail:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(amount)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
