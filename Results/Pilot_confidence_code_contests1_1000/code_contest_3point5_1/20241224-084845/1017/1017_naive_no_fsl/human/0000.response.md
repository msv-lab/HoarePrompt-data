Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw. Specifically, it assumes that if any price minus the minimum price is divisible by `k`, then all prices will eventually become equal. However, this is not always true. The program does not consider the possibility that the difference between the maximum and minimum prices might be larger than `k * (n-1)`, which would make it impossible for all prices to become equal.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 5
10 15 20
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program output is:
```
-1
```

This is incorrect because with `n=3` and `k=5`, it is possible for all prices to become equal in 3 seconds. Here’s a valid sequence:

1. First second: Decrease the 2nd price by 5 → [10, 10, 20]
2. Second second: Decrease the 3rd price by 5 → [10, 10, 15]
3. Third second: Decrease the 3rd price by 5 → [10, 10, 10]

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where it is possible for all prices to become equal. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
