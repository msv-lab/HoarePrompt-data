You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes points a lot. Recently his mom has presented him n points lying on the line OX. Now Petya is wondering in how many ways he can choose three distinct points so that the distance between the two farthest of them doesn't exceed d.

Note that the order of the points inside the group of three chosen points doesn't matter.

Input

The first line contains two integers: n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ d ≤ 109). The next line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn, their absolute value doesn't exceed 109 — the x-coordinates of the points that Petya has got.

It is guaranteed that the coordinates of the points in the input strictly increase.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of groups of three points, where the distance between two farthest points doesn't exceed d.

Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Examples

Input

4 3
1 2 3 4


Output

4


Input

4 2
-3 -2 -1 0


Output

2


Input

5 19
1 10 20 30 50


Output

1

Note

In the first sample any group of three points meets our conditions.

In the seconds sample only 2 groups of three points meet our conditions: {-3, -2, -1} and {-2, -1, 0}.

In the third sample only one group does: {1, 10, 20}.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from bisect import bisect_left

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, d) = map(int, stdin.readline().strip('\n').split(' '))
    xs = map(int, stdin.readline().strip('\n').split(' '))
    result = func_1(xs, d)
    print(result)

def func_1(xs, d):
    total = 0
    (start, count) = (0, 1)
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        if abs(xs[i] - xs[start]) <= d:
            count += 1
        else:
            new_start = bisect_left(xs, xs[i] - d, start, i)
            overlap = i - 1 - new_start + 1
            total += count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) / 6
            if overlap > 0:
                total -= overlap * (overlap - 1) * (overlap - 2) / 6
            start = new_start
            count = i - new_start + 1
    total += count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) / 6
    return total


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
