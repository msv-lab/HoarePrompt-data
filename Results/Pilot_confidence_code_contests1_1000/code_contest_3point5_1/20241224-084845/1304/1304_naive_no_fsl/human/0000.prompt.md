You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Overlooking the captivating blend of myriads of vernal hues, Arkady the painter lays out a long, long canvas.

Arkady has a sufficiently large amount of paint of three colours: cyan, magenta, and yellow. On the one-dimensional canvas split into n consecutive segments, each segment needs to be painted in one of the colours.

Arkady has already painted some (possibly none or all) segments and passes the paintbrush to you. You are to determine whether there are at least two ways of colouring all the unpainted segments so that no two adjacent segments are of the same colour. Two ways are considered different if and only if a segment is painted in different colours in them.

Input

The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the canvas.

The second line contains a string s of n characters, the i-th of which is either 'C' (denoting a segment painted in cyan), 'M' (denoting one painted in magenta), 'Y' (one painted in yellow), or '?' (an unpainted one).

Output

If there are at least two different ways of painting, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).

You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5
CY??Y


Output

Yes


Input

5
C?C?Y


Output

Yes


Input

5
?CYC?


Output

Yes


Input

5
C??MM


Output

No


Input

3
MMY


Output

No

Note

For the first example, there are exactly two different ways of colouring: CYCMY and CYMCY.

For the second example, there are also exactly two different ways of colouring: CMCMY and CYCMY.

For the third example, there are four ways of colouring: MCYCM, MCYCY, YCYCM, and YCYCY.

For the fourth example, no matter how the unpainted segments are coloured, the existing magenta segments will prevent the painting from satisfying the requirements. The similar is true for the fifth example.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    (n, s, cur, ans) = (int(input()), rstr(), 0, 'YES')
    if '?' in s:
        valid = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '?':
                cur += 1
            else:
                if i and s[i] == s[i - 1] and (not cur):
                    valid = 0
                    break
                if cur > 1 or i == cur or s[i] == s[i - 2]:
                    valid += 1
                cur = 0
        print('YES' if valid or cur else 'NO')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                print('NO')
                exit()
        print('YES')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
