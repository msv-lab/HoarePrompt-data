Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the difference between the maximum and minimum heights within the current window exceeds `k` immediately after expanding the window. Specifically, the program may not properly reset the indices and queues when the condition `M - m > k` is met.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
8 19 10 13
```

Expected output:
```
2 1
3 4
```

However, the program output is incorrect:
```
2 1
1 2
```

This is because the program does not correctly update the indices and queues when the condition `M - m > k` is met. The program should ensure that the window is always valid and that the difference between the maximum and minimum heights is not more than `k`.

To fix this, you need to ensure that when `M - m > k`, you correctly reset the indices and re-evaluate the window starting from the next position. This involves updating the indices and ensuring that the new window starts with the correct minimum and maximum values.
