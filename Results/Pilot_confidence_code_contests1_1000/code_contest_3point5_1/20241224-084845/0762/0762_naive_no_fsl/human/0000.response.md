Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of points within a distance D from the origin. The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of points N and the maximum distance D.
2. For each point, it calculates the squared distance from the origin using \(x^2 + y^2\).
3. It checks if the squared distance is less than or equal to \(D^2\) to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues.
4. It increments the counter ans if the condition is met.
5. Finally, it prints the count of such points.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach ensures that the program handles all valid inputs correctly. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the problem statement that this code does not address. Thus, the program is correct.
