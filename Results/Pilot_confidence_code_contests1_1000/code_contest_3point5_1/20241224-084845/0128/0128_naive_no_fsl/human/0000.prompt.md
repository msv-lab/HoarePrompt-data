You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a huge decimal number consisting of n digits. It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either 0 or 1.

You may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation you are allowed to change any digit of your number; you may change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. It is possible that after some operation you can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.

You are also given two integers 0 ≤ y < x < n. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number that has remainder 10^y modulo 10^x. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder 10^y when divided by 10^x.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, x, y (0 ≤ y < x < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the number and the integers x and y, respectively.

The second line of the input contains one decimal number consisting of n digits, each digit of this number is either 0 or 1. It is guaranteed that the first digit of the number is 1.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number having remainder 10^y modulo 10^x. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder 10^y when divided by 10^x.

Examples

Input


11 5 2
11010100101


Output


1


Input


11 5 1
11010100101


Output


3

Note

In the first example the number will be 11010100100 after performing one operation. It has remainder 100 modulo 100000.

In the second example the number will be 11010100010 after performing three operations. It has remainder 10 modulo 100000.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = map(int, str(raw_input()).split(' '))
    k = int(raw_input())
    modu = pow(10, n[1])
    k = k % modu
    k = list(str(k))
    counter = 0
    for i in k:
        if i == '1':
            counter += 1
    if k[len(k) - n[2]] == '1':
        counter -= 1
    else:
        counter += 1
    print(counter)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
