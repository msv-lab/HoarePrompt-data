Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to consider all digits of the input number when calculating the minimum number of operations required. The program only considers the last `n - y` digits of the number (where `n` is the length of the number and `y` is the given parameter), which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
11 5 2
11010100101
```

According to the problem description, we need to make the number such that its remainder when divided by \(10^5\) (i.e., 100000) is \(10^2\) (i.e., 100). The program attempts to achieve this by focusing only on the last five digits (`01001`). However, the correct approach involves considering the entire number and making necessary changes to ensure the desired remainder.

The correct solution should involve iterating through the entire number and counting the number of '1's that need to be flipped to achieve the desired remainder. The program should consider all digits from the position corresponding to \(10^y\) to the end of the number.

Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
