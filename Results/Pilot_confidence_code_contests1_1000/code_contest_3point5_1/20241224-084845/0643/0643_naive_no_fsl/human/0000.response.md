Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of days required to complete all assignments exceeds the total number of vacation days. Specifically, the program should check if the sum of all assignment days is greater than the number of vacation days `N`. If it is, the program should return `-1`. However, the current implementation does not perform this check properly. Instead, it calculates the difference between `N` and the sum of assignment days and prints it directly, which is incorrect.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
10 2
5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

The program incorrectly returns `3` because it does not handle the case where the total assignment days exceed the vacation days.
