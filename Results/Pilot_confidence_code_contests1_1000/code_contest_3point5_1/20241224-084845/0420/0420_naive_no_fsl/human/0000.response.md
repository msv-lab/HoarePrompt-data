Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given final grid can be achieved by a valid sequence of operations. The program iterates through each column and identifies the rows that contain black cells. It then checks if any of these sets of rows have already been used in previous operations to color other columns, ensuring that no row or column is used more than once. If at any point a conflict is found, the program sets the answer to 'NO' and stops further checks. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The program handles all the constraints and examples provided, and no edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements.
