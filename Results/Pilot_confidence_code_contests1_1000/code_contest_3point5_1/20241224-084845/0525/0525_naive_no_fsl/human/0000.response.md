Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each day and checks if the current day meets the criteria for being a not-so-rainy day by comparing the rain amount on that day with the rain amounts of the specified number of days before and after. The program breaks early if a suitable day is found, ensuring that the earliest such day is returned. 

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all potential cases correctly, as it explicitly checks the conditions for each day and ensures that the earliest valid day is printed. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail based on the provided logic.
