Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the forbidden pairs overlap in a way that the current implementation might not account for efficiently. Specifically, the program uses a greedy approach to remove characters based on the first occurrence of a forbidden pair, which might not always result in the minimum number of deletions. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
aabbaa
2
ab
aa
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
```

The program incorrectly removes all 'a' characters, whereas the optimal solution would be to only remove two 'a' characters (one 'a' from each 'ab' pair).

To fix this, a more efficient algorithm is needed, such as using a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum deletions required to avoid forbidden pairs at each position in the string.
