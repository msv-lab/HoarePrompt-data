Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the array can be split into multiple subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 -5
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
YES
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

However, the current implementation only checks if the entire array's sum is non-zero or if the count of non-zero elements is greater than 1. It does not correctly identify that the array can be split into four subarrays as shown above. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
