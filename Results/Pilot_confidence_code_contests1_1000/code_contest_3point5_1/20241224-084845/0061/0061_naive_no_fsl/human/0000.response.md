Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly rearrange the summands in non-decreasing order. Specifically, consider the input `3+2+1`. The program's output is `1+2+3`, which is correct. However, consider the input `1+1+3+1+3`. The expected output is `1+1+1+3+3`, but the program will output `1+1+1+3+3+` with an extra `+` at the end. This is due to the unnecessary `a = len(list1)` and `if a > 1:` condition, which adds an extra `+` to the final output.

To fix this, the program should remove the extra `+` and ensure the output is correctly formatted. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    a = input().strip()  # Remove leading/trailing spaces
    nums = []
    for i in a.split('+'):
        nums.append(int(i))
    nums.sort()
    result = '+'.join(map(str, nums))
    print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version splits the input by `+`, converts each part to an integer, sorts the numbers, and then joins them back with `+` to produce the correct output.
