Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for some cases:

1. **Edge Count Management**: The program does not ensure that exactly `m` edges are added. It will stop adding edges once it reaches the maximum possible edge without checking if `m` edges have been added.
2. **Connected Graph**: The program does not guarantee that the graph will remain connected after adding the required edges. This is a critical requirement since the problem statement specifies that the graph must be connected.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input**
```
5 6
```

**Expected Output**
A connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges, where each pair of connected vertices has a GCD of 1.

**Actual Output**
```
Possible
2 5
3 2
5 1
3 4
4 1
5 4
```

This output might be valid for this specific example, but it fails to maintain connectivity in certain scenarios, especially when trying to form a graph with a large number of edges while ensuring all pairs are relatively prime.

For instance, if we increase the number of edges significantly:
**Input**
```
5 8
```

There is no way to form a connected graph with 5 vertices and 8 edges such that each pair of connected vertices has a GCD of 1. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and will print "Possible" with an invalid set of edges.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the graph remains connected and does not properly manage the edge count for all cases.
