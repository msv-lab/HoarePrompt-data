Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize profit. Specifically, the program always pushes the current day's price into the heap, which leads to incorrect results. For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
10 5 10 5 10
```

The expected output is 10, as you can buy at 5, sell at 10, and then buy at 5 again to sell at 10, yielding a profit of 10. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the profit as 0 because it always keeps pushing the current day's price into the heap without considering the optimal buying and selling strategy.

To fix this, you need to keep track of the minimum price seen so far and only push it into the heap when a higher price is encountered, ensuring that you can make a profitable transaction.
