You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Devu is a dumb guy, his learning curve is very slow. You are supposed to teach him n subjects, the ith subject has ci chapters. When you teach him, you are supposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously.

Let us say that his initial per chapter learning power of a subject is x hours. In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in x hours.

Well Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.

You can teach him the n subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.

Please be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.

Input

The first line will contain two space separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n, x ≤ 105). The next line will contain n space separated integers: c1, c2, ..., cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 105).

Output

Output a single integer representing the answer to the problem.

Note

Look at the first example. Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2 × 1 = 2 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12 + 2 = 14 hours.

Consider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3 × 1 = 3 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2 × 4 = 8 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.

So overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.

Look at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, x) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    C = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    C.sort(reverse=False)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        sum += C[i] * x
        if x > 1:
            x -= 1
    print(sum)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
