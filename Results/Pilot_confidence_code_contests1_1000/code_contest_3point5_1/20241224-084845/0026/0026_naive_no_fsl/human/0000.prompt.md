You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Our beloved detective, Sherlock is currently trying to catch a serial killer who kills a person each day. Using his powers of deduction, he came to know that the killer has a strategy for selecting his next victim.

The killer starts with two potential victims on his first day, selects one of these two, kills selected victim and replaces him with a new person. He repeats this procedure each day. This way, each day he has two potential victims to choose from. Sherlock knows the initial two potential victims. Also, he knows the murder that happened on a particular day and the new person who replaced this victim.

You need to help him get all the pairs of potential victims at each day so that Sherlock can observe some pattern.

Input

First line of input contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed 10), the two initials potential victims. Next line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of days.

Next n lines contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed 10), first being the person murdered on this day and the second being the one who replaced that person.

The input format is consistent, that is, a person murdered is guaranteed to be from the two potential victims at that time. Also, all the names are guaranteed to be distinct and consists of lowercase English letters.

Output

Output n + 1 lines, the i-th line should contain the two persons from which the killer selects for the i-th murder. The (n + 1)-th line should contain the two persons from which the next victim is selected. In each line, the two names can be printed in any order.

Examples

Input

ross rachel
4
ross joey
rachel phoebe
phoebe monica
monica chandler


Output

ross rachel
joey rachel
joey phoebe
joey monica
joey chandler


Input

icm codeforces
1
codeforces technex


Output

icm codeforces
icm technex

Note

In first example, the killer starts with ross and rachel. 

  * After day 1, ross is killed and joey appears. 
  * After day 2, rachel is killed and phoebe appears. 
  * After day 3, phoebe is killed and monica appears. 
  * After day 4, monica is killed and chandler appears. 
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    victims = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
    days = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for day in range(days):
        print(victims[0] + ' ' + victims[1])
        newPeople = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        killed = newPeople[0]
        replacer = newPeople[1]
        if victims[0] == killed:
            victims[0] = replacer
        elif victims[1] == killed:
            victims[1] = replacer
    print(victims[0] + ' ' + victims[1])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
