Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a boring substring appears in the specified range, but the logic inside the function is flawed. 

The issue lies in this part of the code:
```python
if key_pos == -1 or key[key_pos] != s[pos]:
    break
```

This check will incorrectly allow a match when `key_pos` is `-1`, which means the substring has wrapped around the end of the string. This can happen if the boring substring is shorter than the remaining part of the string being checked. For example, consider the following inputs:

- `s = "abababab"`
- Boring substring `b = "aba"`

In this case, the function should detect that `"aba"` appears in `"abababab"`, but it does not because the condition above allows the loop to continue even when `key_pos` is `-1`.

To fix this, the check should ensure that the substring being compared is within the bounds of the original string `s`. A corrected version of the function would look like this:

```python
def func_1(left, right):
    for key in keys:
        for pos in range(right - 1, left - 1, -1):
            key_pos = len(key) - 1 - (right - 1 - pos)
            if 0 <= key_pos < len(key) and key[key_pos] == s[pos]:
                if key_pos == 0:
                    return False
            else:
                break
    return True
```

With this correction, the program should correctly identify the longest contiguous substring of `s` that does not contain any boring substring.
