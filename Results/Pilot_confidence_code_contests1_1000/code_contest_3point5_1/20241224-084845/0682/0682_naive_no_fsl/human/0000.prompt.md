You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After Fox Ciel got off a bus, she found that the bus she was on was a wrong bus and she lost her way in a strange town. However, she fortunately met her friend Beaver Taro and asked which way to go to her castle. Taro's response to her was a string s, and she tried to remember the string s correctly.

However, Ciel feels n strings b1, b2, ... , bn are really boring, and unfortunately she dislikes to remember a string that contains a boring substring. To make the thing worse, what she can remember is only the contiguous substring of s.

Determine the longest contiguous substring of s that does not contain any boring string, so that she can remember the longest part of Taro's response.

Input

In the first line there is a string s. The length of s will be between 1 and 105, inclusive.

In the second line there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10). Next n lines, there is a string bi (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Each length of bi will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.

Each character of the given strings will be either a English alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) or a underscore ('_') or a digit. Assume that these strings are case-sensitive.

Output

Output in the first line two space-separated integers len and pos: the length of the longest contiguous substring of s that does not contain any bi, and the first position of the substring (0-indexed). The position pos must be between 0 and |s| - len inclusive, where |s| is the length of string s.

If there are several solutions, output any.

Examples

Input

ioi

Output

5 5

Note

In the first sample, the solution is traight_alon.

In the second sample, the solution is an empty string, so the output can be «0 0», «0 1», «0 2», and so on.

In the third sample, the solution is either nagio or oisii.
Program:
```
s = raw_input().strip()
keys = [None for i in range(int(raw_input()))]
for i in range(len(keys)):
    keys[i] = raw_input().strip()
(best_length, best_pos) = (0, 0)
(left, right) = (0, 0)
while True:
    if func_1(left, right + 1):
        right += 1
        length = right - left
        if length > best_length:
            best_length = length
            best_pos = left
        if right == len(s):
            break
    else:
        left += 1
print('%d %d' % (best_length, best_pos))

def func_1(left, right):
    pos_range = range(right - 1, left - 1, -1)
    for key in keys:
        for pos in pos_range:
            key_pos = len(key) - right + pos
            if key_pos == -1 or key[key_pos] != s[pos]:
                break
            if key_pos == 0:
                return False
    return True


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
