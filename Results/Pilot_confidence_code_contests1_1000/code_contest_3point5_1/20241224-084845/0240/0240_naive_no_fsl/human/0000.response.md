Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the median smoothing algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not compute the median of the three consecutive elements. Instead, it takes the average of the three elements, which does not satisfy the requirement to find the median value.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
0 0 0 0 0
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
0 1 0 1 0
```

This is because the average approach used in `func_1` does not produce the correct median values. To fix this, the program should replace the averaging operation with a proper median calculation. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(l):
    new = [l[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(l) - 1):
        new.append(sorted([l[i-1], l[i], l[i+1]])[1])
    new.append(l[-1])
    return new
```

With this correction, the program would work as expected for all valid inputs.
