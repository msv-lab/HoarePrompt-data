Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Multiple Occurrences**: The function `func_2` only checks for exact matches between consecutive blocks of `t` and `s`. However, the problem requires finding all occurrences of `s` in `t`, which can span multiple blocks. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   5 3
   3-a 2-b 4-c 3-a 2-c
   2-a 2-b 1-c
   ```
   The correct output should be 1, as the string "aabbc" occurs starting at position 2. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 because it only checks for exact matches without considering overlapping cases.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the pattern `s` can overlap with the blocks of `t`. For instance, in the input:
   ```
   6 1
   3-a 6-b 7-a 4-c 8-e 2-a
   3-a
   ```
   The pattern "aaa" occurs 6 times starting at positions 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 because it only checks for exact matches.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It attempts to use a prefix function (KMP algorithm) to find matches but does not correctly handle the compressed nature of the strings. Specifically, it fails to account for the lengths of the blocks when checking for matches.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
