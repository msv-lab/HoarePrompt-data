Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a cycle is formed by wrapping around the edges of the grid. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 3
AAA
AAA
AAA
```

In this case, there is a cycle formed by the 'A's that wrap around the edges of the grid. However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function does not account for this scenario because it does not check for wrapping around the edges of the grid.

To fix this, the `func_1` function needs to be modified to handle cases where the coordinates wrap around the edges of the grid. This can be done by adding conditions to check for boundary conditions and wrapping around the edges when necessary.
