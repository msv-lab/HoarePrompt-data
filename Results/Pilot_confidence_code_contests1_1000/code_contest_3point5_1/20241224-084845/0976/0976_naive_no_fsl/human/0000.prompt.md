You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zane the wizard had never loved anyone before, until he fell in love with a girl, whose name remains unknown to us.

<image>

The girl lives in house m of a village. There are n houses in that village, lining in a straight line from left to right: house 1, house 2, ..., house n. The village is also well-structured: house i and house i + 1 (1 ≤ i < n) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.

You will be given n integers a1, a2, ..., an that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house i is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then ai equals 0. Otherwise, house i can be bought, and ai represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.

As Zane has only k dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush. Help Zane determine the minimum distance from his crush's house to some house he can afford, to help him succeed in his love.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of houses in the village, the house where the girl lives, and the amount of money Zane has (in dollars), respectively.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — denoting the availability and the prices of the houses.

It is guaranteed that am = 0 and that it is possible to purchase some house with no more than k dollars.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum distance, in meters, from the house where the girl Zane likes lives to the house Zane can buy.

Examples

Input

1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1


Output

20

Note

In the first sample, with k = 20 dollars, Zane can buy only house 5. The distance from house m = 1 to house 5 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 meters.

In the second sample, Zane can buy houses 6 and 7. It is better to buy house 6 than house 7, since house m = 3 and house 6 are only 30 meters away, while house m = 3 and house 7 are 40 meters away.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    count = 1
    while True:
        if m + count < n:
            if arr[m + count] <= k and arr[m + count] != 0:
                print(count + 1) * 10
                exit()
        if m - count > 0:
            if arr[m - count] <= k and arr[m - count] != 0:
                print(count + 1) * 10
                exit()
        count += 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
