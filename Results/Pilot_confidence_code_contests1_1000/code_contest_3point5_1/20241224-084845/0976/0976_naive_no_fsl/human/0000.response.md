Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the nearest affordable house is not in the direction of either increasing or decreasing house indices. Specifically, the program only checks houses in the directions of increasing and decreasing indices but does not check if there is an affordable house within the range `[m-1, m+1]` that is closer than the ones checked.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 3 50
60 0 0 60 50
```

Here, the girl lives in house 3, and Zane has 50 dollars. The affordable houses are house 2 (0 dollars) and house 5 (50 dollars). The closest affordable house to house 3 is house 2, which is only 10 meters away. However, the program does not check this scenario and will incorrectly print `0` because it does not consider the house directly next to the girlâ€™s house.

To fix this, the program needs to check the immediate neighboring houses first before moving further away. Here is an improved version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    
    # Check immediate neighbors first
    for i in [-1, 1]:
        neighbor = m + i
        if 1 <= neighbor <= n and arr[neighbor] != 0 and arr[neighbor] <= k:
            print(abs(i) * 10)
            return
    
    count = 1
    # Check further away houses
    while True:
        if m + count < n:
            if arr[m + count] <= k and arr[m + count] != 0:
                print(count * 10)
                return
        if m - count > 0:
            if arr[m - count] <= k and arr[m - count] != 0:
                print(count * 10)
                return
        count += 1

func()
```

This updated version first checks the immediate neighboring houses and then moves further away if necessary.
