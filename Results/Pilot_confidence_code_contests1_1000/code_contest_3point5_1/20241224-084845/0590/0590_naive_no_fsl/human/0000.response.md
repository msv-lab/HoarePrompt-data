Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `m` (the number of days) is less than the total number of days required to learn all instruments (`sum(array)`). Specifically, the program does not check if it's possible to learn any instruments within the given `m` days. This can be seen in the third test case:

**Input**
```
1 3
4
```

**Expected Output**
```
0
```

However, the program will output:
```
1
1
```

This is because the program does not check if the total days required to learn all instruments exceed `m`. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle this edge case properly.
