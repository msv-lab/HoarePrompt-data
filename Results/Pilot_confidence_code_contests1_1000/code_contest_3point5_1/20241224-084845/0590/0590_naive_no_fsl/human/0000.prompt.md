You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr is a young coder who likes music a lot. He always wanted to learn how to play music but he was busy coding so he got an idea.

Amr has n instruments, it takes ai days to learn i-th instrument. Being busy, Amr dedicated k days to learn how to play the maximum possible number of instruments.

Amr asked for your help to distribute his free days between instruments so that he can achieve his goal.

Input

The first line contains two numbers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10 000), the number of instruments and number of days respectively.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), representing number of days required to learn the i-th instrument.

Output

In the first line output one integer m representing the maximum number of instruments Amr can learn.

In the second line output m space-separated integers: the indices of instruments to be learnt. You may output indices in any order.

if there are multiple optimal solutions output any. It is not necessary to use all days for studying.

Examples

Input

4 10
4 3 1 2


Output

4
1 2 3 4

Input

5 6
4 3 1 1 2


Output

3
1 3 4

Input

1 3
4


Output

0

Note

In the first test Amr can learn all 4 instruments.

In the second test other possible solutions are: {2, 3, 5} or {3, 4, 5}.

In the third test Amr doesn't have enough time to learn the only presented instrument.
Program:
```
def func():
    array_buffer = []
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    array = map(int, raw_input().split())
    array = [(array[i], i + 1) for i in range(n)]
    array.sort()
    for i in range(n):
        if m - array[i][0] >= 0:
            array_buffer.append(array[i][1])
            m -= array[i][0]
    print(len(array_buffer))
    print(' '.join((str(i) for i in array_buffer)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
