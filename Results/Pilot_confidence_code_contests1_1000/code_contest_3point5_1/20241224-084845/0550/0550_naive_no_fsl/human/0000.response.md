Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple walls in the same row or column but not enough to cover all the walls when a bomb is placed. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 3
.*.
***
.*.
```

In this case, the program should output "NO" because placing a bomb in any cell will not be able to wipe out all the walls since there are more walls than can be cleared by a single bomb. However, the current implementation might incorrectly output "YES" and provide coordinates for a cell, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you need to check if the sum of wall counts in any row or column equals the total number of walls. If not, then it's impossible to clear all walls with one bomb. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    g = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    row_count = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    col_count = [0 for _ in range(m)]
    total_walls = 0
    
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if g[r][c] == '*':
                row_count[r] += 1
                col_count[c] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    
    # Check if there exists a row or column that has exactly the total number of walls
    for r in range(n):
        if row_count[r] == total_walls:
            print("YES\n{} {}".format(r + 1, col_count.index(row_count[r]) + 1))
            return
    for c in range(m):
        if col_count[c] == total_walls:
            print("YES\n{} {}".format(row_count.index(col_count[c]) + 1, c + 1))
            return
    
    print("NO")
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks all necessary conditions and handles cases where it is impossible to clear all walls with one bomb.
