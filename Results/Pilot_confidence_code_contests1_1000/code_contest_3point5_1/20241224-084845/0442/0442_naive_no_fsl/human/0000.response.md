Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all labels are distinct and that the largest MEX value is minimized. The program tries to assign labels based on the degree of nodes but does not guarantee that all labels are unique and that the MEX values are as small as possible.

For example, consider the following tree:

```
6
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
5 6
```

The expected output should be:

```
0
3
2
4
1
```

However, the given program might produce the same label for multiple edges or fail to minimize the MEX value effectively. For instance, it might output the same label for edges `(2, 4)` and `(2, 5)` if the degrees of these nodes are handled in the same way, which would violate the condition that all labels must be distinct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirement of ensuring all labels are distinct and that the largest MEX value is minimized for all potential cases.
