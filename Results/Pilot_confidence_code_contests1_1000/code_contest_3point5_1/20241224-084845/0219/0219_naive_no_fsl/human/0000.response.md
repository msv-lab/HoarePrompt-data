Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to handle the problem correctly based on the given examples and the general logic. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and then reads the segments and their endpoints.
2. **Event Handling**: It uses events to process the start and end points of segments, maintaining a heap to keep track of overlapping segments.
3. **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently manage and remove the minimum number of segments needed to ensure no point is covered by more than `k` segments.
4. **Removal Logic**: The program removes segments from the heap when the coverage exceeds `k`, ensuring that the minimum number of segments are removed.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. There do not seem to be any obvious edge cases or inputs where the program would fail. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
