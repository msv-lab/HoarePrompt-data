Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the starting step (0) is broken. According to the problem description, Takahashi starts on the 0-th step, and if this step is broken, the program should return 0 because it is impossible to start from a broken step. However, the current implementation initializes `dp[0]` to 1, which means it assumes it's possible to start from the 0-th step. This leads to incorrect results when the 0-th step is broken.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1
0
```

The expected output is 0, but the program will incorrectly output 1 because it initializes `dp[0]` to 1 and does not handle the case where the starting step is broken.
