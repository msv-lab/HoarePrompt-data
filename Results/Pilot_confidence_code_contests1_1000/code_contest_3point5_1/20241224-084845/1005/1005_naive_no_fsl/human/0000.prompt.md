You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string s. Each character of s is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:

  * 'U': go up, (x, y)  →  (x, y+1); 
  * 'D': go down, (x, y)  →  (x, y-1); 
  * 'L': go left, (x, y)  →  (x-1, y); 
  * 'R': go right, (x, y)  →  (x+1, y). 



The robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in (a, b).

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b, ( - 109 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). The second line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, s only contains characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') — the command.

Output

Print "Yes" if the robot will be located at (a, b), and "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2 2
RU


Output

Yes


Input

1 2
RU


Output

No


Input

-1 1000000000
LRRLU


Output

Yes


Input

0 0
D


Output

Yes

Note

In the first and second test case, command string is "RU", so the robot will go right, then go up, then right, and then up and so on.

The locations of its moves are (0, 0)  →  (1, 0)  →  (1, 1)  →  (2, 1)  →  (2, 2)  →  ...

So it can reach (2, 2) but not (1, 2).
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (x, y) = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    string = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    (mod_positions, cur_position) = ([], (0, 0))
    for char in string:
        mod_positions.append(cur_position)
        if char == 'L':
            cur_position = (cur_position[0] - 1, cur_position[1])
        if char == 'R':
            cur_position = (cur_position[0] + 1, cur_position[1])
        if char == 'U':
            cur_position = (cur_position[0], cur_position[1] + 1)
        if char == 'D':
            cur_position = (cur_position[0], cur_position[1] - 1)
    (dx, dy) = (cur_position[0], cur_position[1])
    for position in mod_positions:
        if position[0] == x and position[1] == y:
            print('Yes')
            sys.exit(0)
        if dy != 0 and (y - position[1]) % dy == 0:
            n_times = (y - position[1]) / dy
            if position[0] + n_times * dx == x and n_times >= 0:
                print('Yes')
                sys.exit(0)
        if dx != 0 and (x - position[0]) % dx == 0:
            n_times = (x - position[0]) / dx
            if position[1] + n_times * dy == y and n_times >= 0:
                print('Yes')
                sys.exit(0)
    print('No')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
