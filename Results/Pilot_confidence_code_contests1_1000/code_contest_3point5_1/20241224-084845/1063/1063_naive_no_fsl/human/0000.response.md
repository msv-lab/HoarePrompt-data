Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cubes needed for the installation based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to count cubes based on the maximum heights given in the front and side views, but it does not account for the optimal arrangement of cubes that minimizes the total number of cubes used.

For example, consider the dataset:

```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program calculates the output as `15`, but the optimal solution would use `13` cubes, as demonstrated in the problem description.

The issue lies in the line:

```python
out += i * max(a.count(str(i)), b.count(str(i)))
```

This line counts the occurrences of each height in both the front and side views independently and multiplies them, which does not necessarily yield the minimum number of cubes. It fails to consider the arrangement of cubes that could potentially reduce the total count.

To verify, let's test the program with the given example:

```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected output: `13` (as per the optimal solution described)

Actual output by the program: `15`

Since the program does not produce the correct result for at least one input case, it is incorrect.
