Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the conditions for a string to be easily playable. Specifically, the program incorrectly checks the characters in the string. For instance, consider the input "RUDLUDR":

1. The program checks if characters in odd positions are `L`. However, it should check if they are `R`, `U`, or `D`.
2. Similarly, it checks if characters in even positions are `R`. However, it should check if they are `L`, `U`, or `D`.

The program incorrectly prints `No` for the first occurrence of an invalid character based on its position, without checking the entire string according to the problem description. This leads to incorrect results for many valid strings. For example, the input "RUDLUDR" should be considered "easily playable" according to the problem description, but the program incorrectly prints `No`.

A correct implementation would involve checking all characters in the string against the specified conditions without prematurely printing `No`.
