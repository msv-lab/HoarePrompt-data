Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two grid paths have different lengths but the input strings `A` and `B` are still compared and processed as if they have the same length. Specifically, the program assumes that both `A` and `B` have the same length (`N-1`), which is not necessarily true based on the problem description. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
NN
SS
```
Here, the lengths of the paths are different (2 vs 1), but the program processes them as if they were the same length, leading to incorrect behavior. The program would compare and process the strings "NN" and "S", which is not valid according to the problem description.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is not properly implemented to handle the copying mechanism described in the problem. It only checks for a specific pair of directions ('N' to 'W' and 'W' to 'N'), but it should handle all possible pairs of opposite directions.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is False.
