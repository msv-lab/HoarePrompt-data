Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to place another knight on the board such that none of the three pieces beat each other. Specifically, the `ADD` function is not correctly implemented. The `ADD` function attempts to add the possible moves of the knight to the set, but it does not handle the constraints properly.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
a1
b2
```

The rook is at `a1`, and the knight is at `b2`. The program should calculate the positions that are safe for placing another knight, ensuring that neither the rook nor the knight at `b2` can capture the new knight.

However, the current implementation of `ADD` is flawed because it does not check if the calculated positions are within the 8x8 board boundaries before adding them to the set. For example, the knight at `b2` can move to `d4`, `a4`, `c3`, etc., but the program might incorrectly add positions outside the board, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the `ADD` function should include boundary checks before adding positions to the set. Here is a corrected version of the `ADD` function:

```python
def ADD(knR, knC):
    moves = [(1, 2), (2, 1), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (1, -2), (2, -1), (-1, -2), (-2, -1)]
    for dr, dc in moves:
        nr, nc = knR + dr, knC + dc
        if 0 <= nr < 8 and 0 <= nc < 8:
            set1.add((nr, nc))
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
