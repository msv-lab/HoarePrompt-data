Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where `b` becomes 0 after a series of operations. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For instance, consider the input `1 1`. According to the problem description, the game should end immediately since both numbers are non-zero and the player who encounters a zero first loses. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect outcome.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected output: `Second`
- Actual output from the provided code: `First`

This is because the code does not correctly recognize that when `a` and `b` are equal and non-zero, the game should end with the second player winning since the first player cannot make a valid move.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
