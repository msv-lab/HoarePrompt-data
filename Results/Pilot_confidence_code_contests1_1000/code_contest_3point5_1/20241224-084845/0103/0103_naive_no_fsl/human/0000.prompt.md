You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In some country live wizards. They love playing with numbers. 

The blackboard has two numbers written on it — a and b. The order of the numbers is not important. Let's consider a ≤ b for the sake of definiteness. The players can cast one of the two spells in turns:

  * Replace b with b - ak. Number k can be chosen by the player, considering the limitations that k > 0 and b - ak ≥ 0. Number k is chosen independently each time an active player casts a spell. 
  * Replace b with b mod a. 



If a > b, similar moves are possible.

If at least one of the numbers equals zero, a player can't make a move, because taking a remainder modulo zero is considered somewhat uncivilized, and it is far too boring to subtract a zero. The player who cannot make a move, loses.

To perform well in the magic totalizator, you need to learn to quickly determine which player wins, if both wizards play optimally: the one that moves first or the one that moves second.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of input data sets (1 ≤ t ≤ 104). Each of the next t lines contains two integers a, b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1018). The numbers are separated by a space.

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Output

For any of the t input sets print "First" (without the quotes) if the player who moves first wins. Print "Second" (without the quotes) if the player who moves second wins. Print the answers to different data sets on different lines in the order in which they are given in the input. 

Examples

Input

4
10 21
31 10
0 1
10 30


Output

First
Second
Second
First

Note

In the first sample, the first player should go to (11,10). Then, after a single move of the second player to (1,10), he will take 10 modulo 1 and win.

In the second sample the first player has two moves to (1,10) and (21,10). After both moves the second player can win.

In the third sample, the first player has no moves.

In the fourth sample, the first player wins in one move, taking 30 modulo 10.
Program:
```
import sys
from math import *

try:
    fi = open('input.txt', 'r')
    fo = open('output.txt', 'w')
except:
    fi = sys.stdin
    fo = sys.stdout
tests = int(fi.readline())
for test in range(tests):
    (a, b) = map(int, fi.readline().split())
    if func_1(min(a, b), max(a, b)):
        fo.write('First\n')
    else:
        fo.write('Second\n')

def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return False
    if b == 0:
        return False
    if not func_1(b % a, a):
        return True
    k = a
    while b > k:
        k *= a
    k //= a
    ans = 0
    while k > 1 and b > 0:
        ans += b // k
        b %= k
        k //= a
    if ans % 2 == 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
