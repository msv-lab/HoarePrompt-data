You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lee tried so hard to make a good div.2 D problem to balance his recent contest, but it still doesn't feel good at all. Lee invented it so tediously slow that he managed to develop a phobia about div.2 D problem setting instead. And now he is hiding behind the bushes...

Let's define a Rooted Dead Bush (RDB) of level n as a rooted tree constructed as described below.

A rooted dead bush of level 1 is a single vertex. To construct an RDB of level i we, at first, construct an RDB of level i-1, then for each vertex u: 

  * if u has no children then we will add a single child to it; 
  * if u has one child then we will add two children to it; 
  * if u has more than one child, then we will skip it. 

<image> Rooted Dead Bushes of level 1, 2 and 3.

Let's define a claw as a rooted tree with four vertices: one root vertex (called also as center) with three children. It looks like a claw:

<image> The center of the claw is the vertex with label 1.

Lee has a Rooted Dead Bush of level n. Initially, all vertices of his RDB are green.

In one move, he can choose a claw in his RDB, if all vertices in the claw are green and all vertices of the claw are children of its center, then he colors the claw's vertices in yellow.

He'd like to know the maximum number of yellow vertices he can achieve. Since the answer might be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Next t lines contain test cases — one per line.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) — the level of Lee's RDB.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of yellow vertices Lee can make modulo 10^9 + 7.

Output

Note

It's easy to see that the answer for RDB of level 1 or 2 is 0.

The answer for RDB of level 3 is 4 since there is only one claw we can choose: \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.

The answer for RDB of level 4 is 4 since we can choose either single claw \{1, 3, 2, 4\} or single claw \{2, 7, 5, 6\}. There are no other claws in the RDB of level 4 (for example, we can't choose \{2, 1, 7, 6\}, since 1 is not a child of center vertex 2).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
