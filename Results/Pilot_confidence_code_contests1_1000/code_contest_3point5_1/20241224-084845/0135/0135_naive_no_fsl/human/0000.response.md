Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the maximum number of yellow vertices in a Rooted Dead Bush (RDB) of level `n`. Specifically, the function `func_2` is not defined, and the logic in `func_1` does not accurately calculate the number of yellow vertices for a given level `n`.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Base Cases**: The base cases for the recursion or iteration should handle levels 1 and 2 explicitly, which should result in 0 yellow vertices since these are trivial cases.

2. **Formula Inconsistency**: The formula used in the loop to compute `sols[i]` does not match the description of the problem. The problem states that a claw consists of a center vertex and three children, and the logic to count such claws needs to be implemented correctly.

3. **Function `func_2` Not Defined**: The function `func_2` is called but not defined in the code, which means it cannot be used to print the results as required.

To address these issues, the following changes are needed:

1. Handle base cases explicitly.
2. Correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid claws.
3. Define and use the `func_2` function to print the results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def count_yellow_vertices(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the DP array
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[3] = 4  # Only one claw possible in RDB of level 3
    
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * dp[i - 2] + (4 if i % 3 == 0 else 0)) % MOD
    
    return dp[n]

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(count_yellow_vertices(n) % MOD)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version handles the base cases explicitly, uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid claws, and prints the results correctly. Given this, the original program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
