You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away two giant IT-corporations Pineapple and Gogol continue their fierce competition. Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.

This new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.

Pineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with "#". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with "#", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.

Substring is a continuous subsequence of a string.

Input

The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100 000 characters. Second line contains the name of the phone released by Pineapple 200 years ago, its length doesn't exceed 30. Both string are non-empty and consist of only small English letters.

Output

Print the minimum number of characters that must be replaced with "#" in order to obtain that the name of the phone doesn't occur in the name of AI as a substring.

Examples

Input

intellect
tell


Output

1

Input

google
apple


Output

0

Input

sirisiri
sir


Output

2

Note

In the first sample AI's name may be replaced with "int#llect".

In the second sample Gogol can just keep things as they are.

In the third sample one of the new possible names of AI may be "s#ris#ri".
Program:
```
def func():
    gogol = raw_input()
    pineapple = raw_input()
    gogol = gogol.replace(pineapple, '#')
    count = 0
    for char in gogol:
        if char == '#':
            count += 1
    print(count)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
