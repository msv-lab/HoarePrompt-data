You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is an interactive problem.

Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of n nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n.

The game master only allows him to ask one type of question:

  * Little Dormi picks a node r (1 ≤ r ≤ n), and the game master will reply with an array d_1, d_2, …, d_n, where d_i is the length of the shortest path from node r to i, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.



Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most ⌈n/2⌉ questions, where ⌈ x ⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!

Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.

Input

The first line of input contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 000), the number of nodes in the tree.

You will then begin interaction.

Output

When your program has found the tree, first output a line consisting of a single "!" followed by n-1 lines each with two space separated integers a and b, denoting an edge connecting nodes a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). Once you are done, terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream.

You may output the edges in any order and an edge (a,b) is considered the same as an edge (b,a). Answering is not considered as a query.

Interaction

After taking input, you may make at most ⌈n/2⌉ queries. Each query is made in the format "? r", where r is an integer 1 ≤ r ≤ n that denotes the node you want to pick for that query.

You will then receive n space separated integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n, where d_i is the length of the shortest path from node r to i, followed by a newline.

After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 



If at any point you make an invalid query or try to make more than ⌈ n/2 ⌉ queries, the interaction will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Hacks

To hack a solution, use the following format.

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 000).

The next n−1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n) denoting an edge between u and v (u ≠ v). These n-1 edges must form a tree.

Examples

0 1 2 2

1 0 1 1

Note

Here is the tree from the first example.

Notice that the edges can be output in any order.

Additionally, here are the answers for querying every single node in example 1:

  * 1: [0,1,2,2] 
  * 2: [1,0,1,1] 
  * 3: [2,1,0,2] 
  * 4: [2,1,2,0]



Below is the tree from the second example interaction.

Lastly, here are the answers for querying every single node in example 2:

  * 1: [0,4,1,3,2] 
  * 2: [4,0,3,1,2] 
  * 3: [1,3,0,2,1] 
  * 4: [3,1,2,0,1] 
  * 5: [2,2,1,1,0]
Program:
```
from __future__ import division,print_function
from heapq import*
from random import*
import sys

n = int(input())
se = set((k for k in range(n)))
ar = [[] for k in range(n)]
d = {}
while se:
    u = min(se)
    d[u] = func_1(u)
    for k in range(n):
        if d[u][k] < 2:
            if k in se:
                se.remove(k)
            if k != u:
                ar[u].append(k)
                ar[k].append(u)
for k in d:
    for i in d:
        if d[k][i] == 3:
            u = func_2(k, i)
            v = func_2(i, k)
            ar[u].append(v)
            ar[v].append(u)
for k in range(n):
    ar[k] = list(set(ar[k]))
print('!')
for k in range(n):
    for i in ar[k]:
        if i > k:
            print(k + 1, i + 1)

def func_1(i):
    print('?', i + 1)
    sys.__stdout__.flush()
    return list(map(int, raw_input().split()))

def func_2(k, i):
    for j in range(n):
        if d[k][j] == 1 and d[i][j] == 2:
            return j

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
