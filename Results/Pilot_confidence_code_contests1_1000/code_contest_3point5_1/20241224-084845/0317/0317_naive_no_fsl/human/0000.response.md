Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` is used to find a common neighbor between two nodes `k` and `i` based on their distances from another node. However, the logic within `func_2` assumes that there is always a unique common neighbor, which is not necessarily true. 

Consider a tree where nodes are arranged in a way that there are multiple common neighbors between `k` and `i`. In such a case, `func_2` might incorrectly choose one of these neighbors, leading to incorrect edge formation. For instance, in a star-like tree with one central node connected to all others, the function might incorrectly choose a leaf node as the common neighbor, leading to wrong edges being added.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
