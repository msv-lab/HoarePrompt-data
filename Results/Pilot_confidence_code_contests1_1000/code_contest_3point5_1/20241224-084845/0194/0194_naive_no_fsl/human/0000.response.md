Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Vasya skips photos correctly. According to the problem description, if Vasya has already opened a photo, he just skips it without spending any additional time. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 3 10
hhhw
```

In this case, the optimal strategy would be:
1. Watch the first photo (1 second).
2. Move to the second photo (2 seconds).
3. Rotate the second photo (3 seconds).
4. Watch the second photo (1 second).
5. Move to the third photo (2 seconds).
6. Rotate the third photo (3 seconds).
7. Skip the fourth photo since it was already watched.

The total time spent is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12\) seconds, but Vasya only has 10 seconds. Therefore, he should not be able to watch the fourth photo. However, the current program incorrectly counts the fourth photo as watched, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that once a photo is watched, it is not counted again even if the remaining time allows for it. This can be achieved by keeping track of which photos have already been watched and adjusting the logic accordingly.
