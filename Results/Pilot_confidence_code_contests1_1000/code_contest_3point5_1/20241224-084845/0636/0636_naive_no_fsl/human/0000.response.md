Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the difference between the maximum and minimum tasks is odd. Let's consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because to balance the load, we need to move 1 task from the server with 3 tasks to the server with 1 task, resulting in the distribution 2, 2, 2. Therefore, the minimum number of seconds required is 1, not 0.

The program incorrectly calculates the number of tasks that need to be balanced and does not account for the odd difference scenario properly. This can be seen in the logic where it attempts to distribute tasks evenly but fails to handle the odd difference correctly.
