You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the school computer room there are n servers which are responsible for processing several computing tasks. You know the number of scheduled tasks for each server: there are mi tasks assigned to the i-th server.

In order to balance the load for each server, you want to reassign some tasks to make the difference between the most loaded server and the least loaded server as small as possible. In other words you want to minimize expression ma - mb, where a is the most loaded server and b is the least loaded one.

In one second you can reassign a single task. Thus in one second you can choose any pair of servers and move a single task from one server to another.

Write a program to find the minimum number of seconds needed to balance the load of servers.

Input

The first line contains positive number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the servers. 

The second line contains the sequence of non-negative integers m1, m2, ..., mn (0 ≤ mi ≤ 2·104), where mi is the number of tasks assigned to the i-th server.

Output

Print the minimum number of seconds required to balance the load.

Note

In the first example two seconds are needed. In each second, a single task from server #2 should be moved to server #1. After two seconds there should be 3 tasks on server #1 and 4 tasks on server #2.

In the second example the load is already balanced.

A possible sequence of task movements for the third example is:

  1. move a task from server #4 to server #1 (the sequence m becomes: 2 2 3 3 5); 
  2. then move task from server #5 to server #1 (the sequence m becomes: 3 2 3 3 4); 
  3. then move task from server #5 to server #2 (the sequence m becomes: 3 3 3 3 3). 



The above sequence is one of several possible ways to balance the load of servers in three seconds.
Program:
```
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        serversCnt = int(raw_input())
        tasks = [int(tmp) for tmp in raw_input().split(' ')]
        total = sum(tasks)
        balancedTask = total // serversCnt
        more = total % serversCnt
        less = total - more
        taskNeedToBalance = 0
        for t in tasks:
            if t <= balancedTask:
                taskNeedToBalance += balancedTask - t
                if less > 0:
                    less -= 1
                else:
                    more -= 1
                    taskNeedToBalance += 1
            else:
                taskNeedToBalance += t - balancedTask - 1
                if more > 0:
                    more -= 1
                else:
                    less -= 1
                    taskNeedToBalance += 1
        print(taskNeedToBalance // 2)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
