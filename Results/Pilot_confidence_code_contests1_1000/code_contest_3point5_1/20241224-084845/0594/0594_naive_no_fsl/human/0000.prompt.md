You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: During the programming classes Vasya was assigned a difficult problem. However, he doesn't know how to code and was unable to find the solution in the Internet, so he asks you to help.

You are given a sequence a, consisting of n distinct integers, that is used to construct the binary search tree. Below is the formal description of the construction process.

  1. First element a_1 becomes the root of the tree. 
  2. Elements a_2, a_3, …, a_n are added one by one. To add element a_i one needs to traverse the tree starting from the root and using the following rules: 
    1. The pointer to the current node is set to the root. 
    2. If a_i is greater than the value in the current node, then its right child becomes the current node. Otherwise, the left child of the current node becomes the new current node. 
    3. If at some point there is no required child, the new node is created, it is assigned value a_i and becomes the corresponding child of the current node. 

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the sequence a.

The second line contains n distinct integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the sequence a itself.

Output

Output n - 1 integers. For all i > 1 print the value written in the node that is the parent of the node with value a_i in it.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
