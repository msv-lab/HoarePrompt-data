Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Binary Search Tree (BST) construction as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses a Treap data structure instead of a plain BST, which leads to incorrect results.

In the problem description, the elements are added to the BST by traversing from the root and deciding whether to go left or right based on the value comparison. However, the provided code uses a Treap, which is a combination of a Binary Search Tree and a Randomized Binary Search Tree. This means that the nodes are not purely based on value comparison but also on priority, which is randomly assigned.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output according to the problem description would be:
```
1 2
```

However, the provided code will generate a different output because it uses Treap properties, not just BST properties. For example, the priority values will affect the structure of the tree, leading to incorrect parent-child relationships.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
