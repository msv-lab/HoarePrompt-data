You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After you had helped Fedor to find friends in the «Call of Soldiers 3» game, he stopped studying completely. Today, the English teacher told him to prepare an essay. Fedor didn't want to prepare the essay, so he asked Alex for help. Alex came to help and wrote the essay for Fedor. But Fedor didn't like the essay at all. Now Fedor is going to change the essay using the synonym dictionary of the English language.

Fedor does not want to change the meaning of the essay. So the only change he would do: change a word from essay to one of its synonyms, basing on a replacement rule from the dictionary. Fedor may perform this operation any number of times.

As a result, Fedor wants to get an essay which contains as little letters «R» (the case doesn't matter) as possible. If there are multiple essays with minimum number of «R»s he wants to get the one with minimum length (length of essay is the sum of the lengths of all the words in it). Help Fedor get the required essay.

Please note that in this problem the case of letters doesn't matter. For example, if the synonym dictionary says that word cat can be replaced with word DOG, then it is allowed to replace the word Cat with the word doG.

Input

The first line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of words in the initial essay. The second line contains words of the essay. The words are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that the total length of the words won't exceed 105 characters.

The next line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of pairs of words in synonym dictionary. The i-th of the next n lines contains two space-separated non-empty words xi and yi. They mean that word xi can be replaced with word yi (but not vise versa). It is guaranteed that the total length of all pairs of synonyms doesn't exceed 5·105 characters.

All the words at input can only consist of uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

Output

Print two integers — the minimum number of letters «R» in an optimal essay and the minimum length of an optimal essay.

                    rCount += rChange
                    length += lChange
                else:
                    length += lWord
                    rCount += rWord
            elif lChange < lWord and (not rChange):
                ref[i] = change
                length += lChange
            else:
                length += lWord
        else:

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
