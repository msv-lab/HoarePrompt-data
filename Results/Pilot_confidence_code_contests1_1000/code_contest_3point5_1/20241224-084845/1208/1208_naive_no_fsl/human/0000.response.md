Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of words `m`, the words of the essay, and the number of synonym pairs `n`. It also reads the synonym pairs and stores them in a dictionary for quick lookup.

2. **Processing Each Word**: For each word in the essay, it checks if the word (in lowercase) exists in the dictionary:
   - If it exists, it replaces the word with its synonym and updates the count of 'R' and the total length accordingly.
   - If the synonym has fewer 'R's or the same number of 'R's but a shorter length, it makes the replacement.
   - If the synonym does not have fewer 'R's or the same number of 'R's but a longer length, it keeps the original word.
   - If the word is not in the dictionary, it simply counts the 'R's and adds the word length as is.

3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum number of 'R's and the minimum length of the essay.

Given the logic, the program handles all the necessary conditions and examples provided in the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that the program would fail to handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
