Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `update` method. Specifically, after updating the value at a given position, it attempts to propagate the change up the tree by comparing the values of the two children nodes, but it does not properly update the parent node with the minimum value. This leads to incorrect results when performing `find` operations, especially after updates.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:

```
3 5
0 0 1
0 1 2
0 2 3
1 0 2
1 1 2
```

The expected output for this input is:

```
1
2
```

However, due to the error in the `update` method, the program will not produce the correct output. The `find` operation after the updates will not reflect the most recent changes, leading to incorrect minimum values being reported. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
