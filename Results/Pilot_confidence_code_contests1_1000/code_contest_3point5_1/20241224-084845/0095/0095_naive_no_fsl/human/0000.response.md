Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made sharpened. Specifically, the program checks if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing using `func_1` and `func_2`, which are unnecessary checks since the problem statement requires the existence of a peak (`a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k` and `a_k > a_{k+1} > ... > a_n`). 

The main issue lies in the logic after determining the index `ind`. The program attempts to ensure that all elements after `ind` are less than or equal to `mini - 1` and ensures no element becomes negative during this process. However, the logic does not properly handle the case where the array can still be transformed into a sharpened array without violating the condition that all elements remain non-negative.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
4
1 2 3 4
```

The given array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` cannot be transformed into a sharpened array by the allowed operations, but the program incorrectly outputs "Yes".

To correctly verify the solution, the program needs to ensure that there exists a valid `k` such that the subarray from `1` to `k` is strictly increasing and the subarray from `k` to `n` is strictly decreasing while ensuring no elements become negative. The current implementation does not fully cover this requirement.
