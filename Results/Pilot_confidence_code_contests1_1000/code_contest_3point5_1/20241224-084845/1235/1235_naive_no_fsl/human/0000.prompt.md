You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are playing another computer game, and now you have to slay n monsters. These monsters are standing in a circle, numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th monster has a_i health.

You may shoot the monsters to kill them. Each shot requires exactly one bullet and decreases the health of the targeted monster by 1 (deals 1 damage to it). Furthermore, when the health of some monster i becomes 0 or less than 0, it dies and explodes, dealing b_i damage to the next monster (monster i + 1, if i < n, or monster 1, if i = n). If the next monster is already dead, then nothing happens. If the explosion kills the next monster, it explodes too, damaging the monster after it and possibly triggering another explosion, and so on.

You have to calculate the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all n monsters in the circle.

Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) — the number of test cases.

Then the test cases follow, each test case begins with a line containing one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) — the number of monsters. Then n lines follow, each containing two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^{12}) — the parameters of the i-th monster in the circle.

It is guaranteed that the total number of monsters in all test cases does not exceed 300000.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all of the monsters.

def func():
    stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
    stdout = BytesIO()
    input = stdin.readline
    write = lambda x: os.write(1, x)
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        monsters = []
        mnShots = 0
        start = float('inf')
        for n in range(N):
            monsters.append(map(int, input().split()))
        for n in range(N):
            cur = monsters[n]
            dam = max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])
            mnShots += dam
            start = min(start, cur[0] - dam)
        res.append(mnShots + start)
    write('\n'.join((str(x) for x in res)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
