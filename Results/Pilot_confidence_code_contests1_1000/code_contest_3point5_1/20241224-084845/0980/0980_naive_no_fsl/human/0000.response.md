Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the boundary elements (a1 and an) correctly. According to the problem description, the first and last elements of the array cannot be local minima or local maxima, but the program includes them in the count of local extrema. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

The output should be `0` because none of the elements are local extrema. However, the current implementation would incorrectly count the middle element `2` as a local extremum, resulting in an output of `1`. This violates the problem description, making the program incorrect.
