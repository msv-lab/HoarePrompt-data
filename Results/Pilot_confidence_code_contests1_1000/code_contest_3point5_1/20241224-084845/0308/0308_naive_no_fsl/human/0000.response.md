Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a round dance can be started based on the given problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not properly check for either clockwise or counterclockwise round dances.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The current implementation checks the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array but does not handle the circular nature of the problem correctly. For instance, it uses `n // 2` to adjust the values, which is not necessary for a proper check.

2. **Circular Nature Not Handled**: The program does not correctly handle the circular nature of the permutation. For example, in a circle of 4 students with indices `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the student 4 should come after student 1 in a clockwise direction. However, the current implementation fails to check this properly.

3. **Example Where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider the input `4 1 2 3 4`. This is a valid clockwise round dance, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly handle the circular nature of the permutation.

To fix this, the program needs to check both clockwise and counterclockwise conditions properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check clockwise round dance
        clockwise = True
        for i in range(n):
            if p[(i + 1) % n] != p[i] + 1:
                clockwise = False
                break
        
        # Check counterclockwise round dance
        counterclockwise = True
        for i in range(n):
            if p[(i + 1) % n] != p[i] - 1 and p[(i + 1) % n] != p[i] + (n - 1):
                counterclockwise = False
                break
        
        if clockwise or counterclockwise:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks both clockwise and counterclockwise conditions correctly, ensuring that the program works for all valid cases.
