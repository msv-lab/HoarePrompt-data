You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters, and the integer m.

One should choose some symbols from the given string so that any contiguous subsegment of length m has at least one selected symbol. Note that here we choose positions of symbols, not the symbols themselves.

Then one uses the chosen symbols to form a new string. All symbols from the chosen position should be used, but we are allowed to rearrange them in any order.

Formally, we choose a subsequence of indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < it ≤ |s|. The selected sequence must meet the following condition: for every j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ |s| - m + 1, there must be at least one selected index that belongs to the segment [j, j + m - 1], i.e. there should exist a k from 1 to t, such that j ≤ ik ≤ j + m - 1.

Then we take any permutation p of the selected indices and form a new string sip1sip2... sipt.

Find the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using this procedure.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The second line contains the string s consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that this string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100 000. It is also guaranteed that the number m doesn't exceed the length of the string s.

Output

Print the single line containing the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using the procedure described above.

Examples

Input

3
cbabc


Output

a


Input

2
abcab


Output

aab


Input

3
bcabcbaccba


Output

aaabb

Note

In the first sample, one can choose the subsequence {3} and form a string "a".

In the second sample, one can choose the subsequence {1, 2, 4} (symbols on this positions are 'a', 'b' and 'a') and rearrange the chosen symbols to form a string "aab".

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
