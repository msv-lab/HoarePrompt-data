Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple characters have the same minimum lexicographical value correctly. Specifically, the program only considers one character with the minimum lexicographical value at each step, which may not result in the lexicographically smallest possible string.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
bcabcbaccba
```

According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained is "aaabb". However, the program's output is "aaabb", which is correct in this case. But let's consider another example to highlight the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
bbccabcbaccba
```

The lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained is "aaabb". However, the program might output "aabbb" because it only considers the first occurrence of the minimum lexicographical character at each step. This is incorrect as it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all characters with the minimum lexicographical value are included in the result and are distributed optimally.
