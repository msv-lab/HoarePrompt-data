Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the sequence of numbers provided can be generated by the described process. Let's consider the following case:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
4
0 1 2 239
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for the given input, which indicates that the array `[0, 1, 2, 239]` can be formed without any mistakes. However, according to the problem description, the number `239` cannot be obtained after adding only `0`, `1`, and `2` because the mex operation would never produce `239` from these values. Therefore, the program fails to identify this mistake, making it incorrect.
