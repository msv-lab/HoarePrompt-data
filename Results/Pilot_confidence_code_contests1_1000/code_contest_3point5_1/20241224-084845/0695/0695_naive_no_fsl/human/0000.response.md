Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by considering all possible permutations of prefixes, but it does not handle the logic correctly. Specifically, the program uses unnecessary complexity and incorrect comparisons. 

For instance, consider the input `bbab`:
- The expected output is `0 1 1 0`, which means no reversal for the first character, reverse the second and third characters, and no reversal for the fourth character.
- However, the program's output for this input is not correct. It seems to be performing operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

The program uses a flawed approach by comparing multiple permutations of the prefix, which is unnecessary and overly complex. Instead, the solution should focus on ensuring that 'a' characters are moved to the left as much as possible while maintaining the original order of 'b' characters.

A simpler and more appropriate approach would be to iterate through the string and decide whether to reverse each prefix based on whether the current character is 'a' or 'b' compared to the previous character. This would ensure that 'a' characters are pushed to the leftmost positions, achieving the lexicographically smallest string.
