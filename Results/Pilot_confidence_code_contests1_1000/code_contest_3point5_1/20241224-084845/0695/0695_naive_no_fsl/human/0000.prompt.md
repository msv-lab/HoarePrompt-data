You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: IA has so many colorful magnets on her fridge! Exactly one letter is written on each magnet, 'a' or 'b'. She loves to play with them, placing all magnets in a row. However, the girl is quickly bored and usually thinks how to make her entertainment more interesting.

Today, when IA looked at the fridge, she noticed that the word formed by magnets is really messy. "It would look much better when I'll swap some of them!" — thought the girl — "but how to do it?". After a while, she got an idea. IA will look at all prefixes with lengths from 1 to the length of the word and for each prefix she will either reverse this prefix or leave it as it is. She will consider the prefixes in the fixed order: from the shortest to the largest. She wants to get the lexicographically smallest possible word after she considers all prefixes. Can you help her, telling which prefixes should be chosen for reversing?

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

Input

The first and the only line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000), describing the initial string formed by magnets. The string s consists only of characters 'a' and 'b'.

Output

Output exactly |s| integers. If IA should reverse the i-th prefix (that is, the substring from 1 to i), the i-th integer should be equal to 1, and it should be equal to 0 otherwise.

If there are multiple possible sequences leading to the optimal answer, print any of them.

Examples

Input

bbab


Output

0 1 1 0


Input

aaaaa


Output

1 0 0 0 1

Note

In the first example, IA can reverse the second and the third prefix and get a string "abbb". She cannot get better result, since it is also lexicographically smallest string obtainable by permuting characters of the initial string.

In the second example, she can reverse any subset of prefixes — all letters are 'a'.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def func():
    s = raw_input()
    mina = (s[0], '0')
    maxa = (s[0], '0')
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        str1 = (mina[0] + s[i])[::-1]
        str2 = mina[0] + s[i]
        str3 = (maxa[0] + s[i])[::-1]
        str4 = maxa[0] + s[i]
        min_s = min(str1, str2, str3, str4)
        max_s = max(str1, str2, str3, str4)
        if min_s == str1:
            mina = (str1, mina[1] + '1')
        elif min_s == str2:
            mina = (str2, mina[1] + '0')
        elif min_s == str3:
            mina = (str3, mina[1] + '1')
        else:
            mina = (str4, mina[1] + '0')
        if max_s == str1:
            maxa = (str1, maxa[1] + '1')
        elif min_s == str2:
            maxa = (str2, maxa[1] + '0')
        elif max_s == str3:
            maxa = (str3, maxa[1] + '1')
        else:
            maxa = (str4, maxa[1] + '0')
    print(mina[1])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
