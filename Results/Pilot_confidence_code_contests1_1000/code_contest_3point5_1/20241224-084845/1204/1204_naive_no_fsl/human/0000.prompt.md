You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The sequence is called ordered if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, sequnces [3, 1, 1, 0] and [1, 2, 3, 100] are ordered, but the sequence [1, 3, 3, 1] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to find it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n space-separated integers — the given sequence. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed 106 by absolute value.

Output

If the given sequence does not contain any unordered subsequences, output 0. Otherwise, output the length k of the shortest such subsequence. Then output k integers from the range [1..n] — indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are several solutions, output any of them.

        while i + 1 < n and l[i] == l[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        if i == n - 1:
            print(0)
        else:
            a = i
            if l[a] < l[a + 1]:
                i = a + 1
                while i + 1 < n and l[i] <= l[i + 1]:
                    i += 1
                if i == n - 1:
                    print(0)
                else:

                    print(str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 2))
            if l[a] > l[a + 1]:
                i = a + 1
                while i + 1 < n and l[i] >= l[i + 1]:
                    i += 1
                if i == n - 1:
                    print(0)
                else:
                    print(3)
                    print(str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 2))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
