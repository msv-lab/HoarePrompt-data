Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is 0 correctly. According to the problem description and the provided examples, when `a` is 0, the output should be 0, but the program adds `b[0]` to `res`, which is 1. This causes the program to produce an incorrect output for the input `0`. For example, if the input is `0`, the expected output is `0`, but the program outputs `1`.
