Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the loop condition `sm > x` is incorrectly implemented. The variable `sm` is supposed to represent the sum of the number of cells needed to build the current staircase and all previous staircases. However, the loop increments `i` to the next value before checking the condition, which can lead to an off-by-one error.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `x = 8`

The correct output should be `2`, as two nice staircases can be built: one with 1 stair (1 cell) and another with 3 stairs (7 cells).

However, the provided program will output `1` because it will break the loop after checking `i = 3` (which would require 8 cells), and thus will not count the second staircase.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        ans = 0
        l = 1
        sm = 0
        while sm + l * (l + 1) // 2 <= x:
            sm += l * (l + 1) // 2
            ans += 1
            l += 2
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the loop continues until adding the next staircase would exceed the available cells, and it correctly counts the number of nice staircases that can be built.
