You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She likes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she decided to craft staircases.

A staircase is a squared figure that consists of square cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a staircase has n stairs, then it is made of n columns, the first column is 1 cell high, the second column is 2 cells high, …, the n-th column if n cells high. The lowest cells of all stairs must be in the same row.

A staircase with n stairs is called nice, if it may be covered by n disjoint squares made of cells. All squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase.

This is how a nice covered staircase with 7 stairs looks like: <image>

Find out the maximal number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than x cells, in total. No cell can be used more than once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The description of each test case contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of cells for building staircases.

Output

For each test case output a single integer — the number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using not more than x cells, in total.

Example

Input

1
8
6
1000000000000000000


Output


1
2
1
30

Note

In the first test case, it is possible to build only one staircase, that consists of 1 stair. It's nice. That's why the answer is 1.

In the second test case, it is possible to build two different nice staircases: one consists of 1 stair, and another consists of 3 stairs. This will cost 7 cells. In this case, there is one cell left, but it is not possible to use it for building any nice staircases, that have not been built yet. That's why the answer is 2.

In the third test case, it is possible to build only one of two nice staircases: with 1 stair or with 3 stairs. In the first case, there will be 5 cells left, that may be used only to build a staircase with 2 stairs. This staircase is not nice, and Jett only builds nice staircases. That's why in this case the answer is 1. If Jett builds a staircase with 3 stairs, then there are no more cells left, so the answer is 1 again.
Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(raw_input())
        l = 1
        ans = 1
        sm = 1
        for i in range(2, 10 ^ 6):
            l = 2 * l + 1
            sm += l * (l + 1) / 2
            if sm > x:
                break
        print(i - 1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
