Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining if the set of integers is pairwise coprime, setwise coprime, or neither. Specifically, the function `func_3` contains a flaw that leads to incorrect results.

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Function `func_3` Logic Flaw**:
   - In `func_3`, the program checks divisibility by each prime factor of `a[0]` and removes those primes from `active` if they do not divide `a[i]`. However, this logic incorrectly assumes that if a prime factor is removed, the set will become empty, which is not necessarily true. This can lead to false positives for the `setwise coprime` condition.

2. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input `3 6 10 16`. Here, the numbers are not pairwise coprime because GCD(6, 10) = 2, but the GCD of all three numbers is 1, making it setwise coprime.
   - The program will first check the primes of 6 (`{2, 3}`), then 10 (`{2, 5}`), and finally 16 (`{2}`). It will remove primes from `active` based on divisibility, but it does not correctly handle the removal and re-evaluation of primes.

### Corrected Approach:
- To correctly determine if the set is setwise coprime, we need to ensure that after removing primes from `active`, we still have at least one prime left, indicating that the GCD is 1 but not all pairs are coprime.

### Example Fix:
- Modify `func_3` to correctly check if there is at least one prime left after removing primes based on divisibility.

Here is a corrected version of the problematic part:

```python
def func_3():
    active = func_4(a[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not a[i] % a[i - 1] == 0:
            rm = []
            for act in active.copy():  # Use copy to avoid modifying during iteration
                if not a[i] % act == 0:
                    rm.append(act)
            for r in rm:
                active.remove(r)
                if len(active) == 0:  # Check if active is empty
                    print('setwise coprime')
                    return
    if len(active) == 0:
        print('setwise coprime')
    else:
        print('not coprime')
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly handles the conditions for setwise coprime and other cases.
