Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple pupils can potentially change places with the pupil directly in front of them, but only one such pupil can be chosen to maximize the number of places Nastya can move forward. Specifically, the program does not ensure that it selects the optimal pupil among those who can change places with the pupil directly in front of them. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 3
4 1 3 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

The optimal sequence of changes would be:
1. Change places for pupils with numbers 1 and 2.
2. Change places for pupils with numbers 2 and 3.
3. Change places for pupils with numbers 3 and 4.

This results in the queue becoming `[2, 1, 4, 3]`, allowing Nastya to move forward by 3 places. The program incorrectly only considers the first eligible pupil, leading to an incorrect result.
