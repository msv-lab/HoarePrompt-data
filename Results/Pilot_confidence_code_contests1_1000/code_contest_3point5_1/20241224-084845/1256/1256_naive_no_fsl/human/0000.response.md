Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum amount of gold needed to spread the rumor. The issue lies in the `dfsUtil` method, where the cost calculation is incorrect. The current implementation only considers the minimum cost to spread the rumor from the current node to its friends but does not ensure that all nodes are visited and the rumor is spread optimally.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the rumor spreads to all nodes in the most cost-effective way. One approach is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always spread the rumor to the node with the lowest cost next. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.

Here's a revised version of the `dfs` method using a priority queue:

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush

def dfs(g, a):
    (ans, visit) = (0, [False] * n)
    pq = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    heapify(pq)
    visit[a[0]] = True
    ans += a[0]
    
    while pq:
        cost, u = heappop(pq)
        for v in g[u]:
            if not visit[v]:
                visit[v] = True
                ans += a[v]
                heappush(pq, (a[v], v))
                
    print(ans)

def func():
    class graph:
    
        def __init__(self):
            (self.gdict, self.edges, self.l) = (defaultdict(list), defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int))
    
        def addEdge(self, node1, node2, w=None):
            self.gdict[node1].append(node2)
            self.gdict[node2].append(node1)
    
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (a, g) = (rints(), graph())
    for _ in range(m):
        (u, v) = rints()
        g.addEdge(u - 1, v - 1)
    dfs(g, a)

func()
```

This revised code uses a priority queue to ensure that the rumor spreads to the node with the lowest cost first, thus minimizing the total cost. With this change, the program should now correctly calculate the minimum amount of gold needed to spread the rumor.
