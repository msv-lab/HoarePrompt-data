You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is an active Internet user. One day he came across an Internet resource he liked, so he wrote its address in the notebook. We know that the address of the written resource has format:

<protocol>://<domain>.ru[/<context>]

where:

  * <protocol> can equal either "http" (without the quotes) or "ftp" (without the quotes), 
  * <domain> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters, 
  * the /<context> part may not be present. If it is present, then <context> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters. 



If string <context> isn't present in the address, then the additional character "/" isn't written. Thus, the address has either two characters "/" (the ones that go before the domain), or three (an extra one in front of the context).

When the boy came home, he found out that the address he wrote in his notebook had no punctuation marks. Vasya must have been in a lot of hurry and didn't write characters ":", "/", ".".

Help Vasya to restore the possible address of the recorded Internet resource.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string that Vasya wrote out in his notebook. This line consists of lowercase English letters only. 

It is guaranteed that the given string contains at most 50 letters. It is guaranteed that the given string can be obtained from some correct Internet resource address, described above.

Output

Print a single line â€” the address of the Internet resource that Vasya liked. If there are several addresses that meet the problem limitations, you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

httpsunrux


Output

http://sun.ru/x


Input

ftphttprururu


Output

ftp://http.ru/ruru

Note

In the second sample there are two more possible answers: "ftp://httpruru.ru" and "ftp://httpru.ru/ru".
Program:
```
def func():
    d = raw_input()
    ip = ''
    dom = ''
    cont = ''
    com = ''
    sam = ''
    result = ''
    if d[0:4] == 'http':
        ip = 'http'
        for i in range(4, len(d)):
            sam = d[4:i + 1]
            if i == len(d) - 1:
                if sam[len(sam) - 2:len(sam)] == 'ru':
                    com = '.ru'
                    dom = sam[0:len(sam) - 2]
                    result = ip + '://' + dom + com
            if (i < len(d) - 1) & (len(sam) > 2):
                if sam[len(sam) - 2:len(sam)] == 'ru':
                    com = '.ru'
                    cont = d[i + 1:len(d)]
                    dom = sam[0:len(sam) - 2]
                    result = ip + '://' + dom + com + '/' + cont
                    break
    if d[0:3] == 'ftp':
        ip = 'ftp'
        for i in range(3, len(d)):
            sam = d[3:i + 1]
            if i == len(d) - 1:
                if sam[len(sam) - 2:len(sam)] == 'ru':
                    com = '.ru'
                    dom = sam[0:len(sam) - 2]
                    reult = ip + '://' + dom + com
            if (i < len(d) - 1) & (len(sam) > 2):
                if len(sam) > 2:
                    if sam[len(sam) - 2:len(sam)] == 'ru':
                        com = '.ru'
                        cont = d[i + 1:len(d)]
                        dom = sam[0:len(sam) - 2]
                        result = ip + '://' + dom + com + '/' + cont
                        break
    print(result)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
