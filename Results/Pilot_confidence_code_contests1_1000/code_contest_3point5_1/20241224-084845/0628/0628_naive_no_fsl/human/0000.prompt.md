You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.

This time he has a pair of integers l and r (l ≤ r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integers x (l ≤ x ≤ r), that the first digit of integer x equals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as 101, 477474 or 9 will be included in the answer and 47, 253 or 1020 will not.

Help him and count the number of described numbers x for a given pair l and r.

Input

The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

2 47


Output

12


Input

47 1024


Output

98

Note

In the first sample the answer includes integers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44. 
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    (lower, upper) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
    print(res)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
