Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `input()` which is not standard in Python 3. In Python 3, `input()` expects a string and returns it as a string. To read integers from input, you should use `sys.stdin.read()` or `map(int, input().split())`. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input is provided using Python 3's `input()` which expects strings. 

Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

Actual Output (with current code in Python 3):
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

To fix this, you should modify the input reading part of the code to:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.reverse()
for i in range(n):
    sys.stdout.write(str(a[i]))
    if i < n - 1:
        sys.stdout.write(' ')
print()
```

This version ensures that the input is read correctly in both Python 2 and Python 3.
