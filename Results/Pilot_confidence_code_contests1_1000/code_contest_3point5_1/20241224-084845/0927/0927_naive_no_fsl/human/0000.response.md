Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the word wrapping according to the specified rules. Specifically, the program fails to properly handle the placement of hyphens and the resulting line breaks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Hyphen Handling**: The program attempts to handle hyphens by splitting the list of indices where hyphens occur and then creating new lists for potential splits. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the word wrapping process, where the part of the word before the hyphen and the hyphen itself stay on the current line, and the rest of the word goes to the next line.

2. **Line Break Placement**: The program does not ensure that the placement of line breaks follows the rule that no hyphen is adjacent to a space, and no spaces are added before the first word or after the last word. It also does not handle the case where a word can contain multiple hyphens and needs to be split across lines accordingly.

3. **Minimal Width Calculation**: The program calculates the minimal width without correctly simulating the word wrapping process. This means it does not guarantee that the resulting ad occupies no more than `k` lines and has the minimal width.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
Edu-ca-tion-al Ro-unds are so fun
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

However, the provided program might not produce the correct output because it does not correctly handle the word wrapping and placement of hyphens. For instance, it may incorrectly place a line break in the middle of a word containing a hyphen, leading to an incorrect minimal width.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
