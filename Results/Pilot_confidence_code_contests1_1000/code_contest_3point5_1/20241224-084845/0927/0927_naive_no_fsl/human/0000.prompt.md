You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The main city magazine offers its readers an opportunity to publish their ads. The format of the ad should be like this:

There are space-separated non-empty words of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

There are hyphen characters '-' in some words, their positions set word wrapping points. Word can include more than one hyphen. 

It is guaranteed that there are no adjacent spaces and no adjacent hyphens. No hyphen is adjacent to space. There are no spaces and no hyphens before the first word and after the last word. 

When the word is wrapped, the part of the word before hyphen and the hyphen itself stay on current line and the next part of the word is put on the next line. You can also put line break between two words, in that case the space stays on current line. Check notes for better understanding.

The ad can occupy no more that k lines and should have minimal width. The width of the ad is the maximal length of string (letters, spaces and hyphens are counted) in it.

You should write a program that will find minimal width of the ad.

Input

The first line contains number k (1 ≤ k ≤ 105).

The second line contains the text of the ad — non-empty space-separated words of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and hyphens. Total length of the ad don't exceed 106 characters.

Output

Output minimal width of the ad.

Examples

Input

4
garage for sa-le


Output

7


Input

4
Edu-ca-tion-al Ro-unds are so fun


Output

10

Note

Here all spaces are replaced with dots.

In the first example one of possible results after all word wraps looks like this:
    
    
      
    garage.  
    for.  
    sa-  
    le  
    

The second example:
    
    
      
    Edu-ca-  
    tion-al.  
    Ro-unds.  
    are.so.fun  
    
Program:
```
import sys, threading, os.path
import collections, heapq, math,bisect

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
threading.stack_size(2 ** 27)

    func_1()

    else:

    k = int(input.readline())
    s = str(input.readline().rstrip('\n'))
    lis1 = []
    for (i, x) in enumerate(s):
        if x == '-' or x == ' ':
            lis1.append(i)

    h = []
    heapq.heappush(h, (-len(lis1), lis1))
    res = []

        k -= 1
    maxone = -1
    '\n    \n    mineone = min(res)\n    mineone.append(0)\n    mineone.sort()\n    for x in res:\n        maxone = max(maxone,x[len(x)-1]-x[0])\n    '
    for (y, x) in h:

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
