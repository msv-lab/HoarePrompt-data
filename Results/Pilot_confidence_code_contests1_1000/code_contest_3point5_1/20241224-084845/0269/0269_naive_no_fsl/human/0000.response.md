Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum inconvenience as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum inconvenience is flawed.

### Issue Identified:
The function `func_5` attempts to distribute the total number of cars evenly across the sub-tracks to minimize the inconvenience. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result. The formula used to compute the minimum inconvenience is incorrect.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

#### Expected Output:
The inconvenience should be calculated as follows:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{4} \sum_{j=i+1}^{4} |a_i - a_j|
\]
For \(a = [2, 2, 2, 2]\):
\[
= |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-2| = 0
\]

So, the expected output is `0`.

#### Program Output:
However, the program incorrectly calculates the output as:
\[
\text{fillWith} = \left\lceil \frac{8}{4} \right\rceil = 2
\]
\[
\text{last} = 8 - 2 \times (8 // 2) = 8 - 2 \times 4 = 0
\]
Since \(s \% n \neq 0\), the program prints:
\[
\text{print(int(aaa * last))}
\]
where `aaa` is computed incorrectly. This results in the wrong output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum inconvenience for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
