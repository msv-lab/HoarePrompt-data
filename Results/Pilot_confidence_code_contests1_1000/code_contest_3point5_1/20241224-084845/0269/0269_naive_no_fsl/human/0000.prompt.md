You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into n sub-tracks. You are given an array a where a_i represents the number of traffic cars in the i-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as ∑_{i=1}^{n} ∑_{j=i+1}^{n} \lvert a_i-a_j\rvert, where |x| is the absolute value of x. 

You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.

Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 2⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Example

Input


3
3
1 2 3
4
0 1 1 0
10
8 3 6 11 5 2 1 7 10 4


Output


0
4
21

Note

For the first test case, you can move a car from the 3-rd sub-track to the 1-st sub-track to obtain 0 inconvenience.

For the second test case, moving any car won't decrease the inconvenience of the track.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
