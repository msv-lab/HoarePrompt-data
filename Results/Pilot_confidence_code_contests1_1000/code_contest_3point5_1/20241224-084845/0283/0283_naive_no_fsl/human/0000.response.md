Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that Heidi (the highest-ranked zombie) needs to ensure her offer is accepted by at least half of the attendees, including herself. 

For example, consider the case where `N = 3`:
- According to the problem, Heidi needs to make an offer that ensures at least two attendees (including herself) accept the offer.
- The minimum number of brains required should be such that Heidi can get at least one brain, and the remaining brains should be distributed in a way that at least one other zombie (the second-highest ranked) also gets at least one brain to ensure acceptance.

In this case, the output of the program would be `2`, but the correct answer should be `2`. However, the logic in the program does not handle the scenario correctly because it only checks if the number of brains is at least half of the attendees, without ensuring that the distribution is optimal for Heidi to get at least one brain and at least one other zombie to get at least one brain.

The correct logic should involve Heidi offering just enough brains to herself and the second-highest ranked zombie to secure their votes, plus one more brain to ensure she has at least one brain herself. For `N = 3`, the correct output should be `2` (Heidi gets 1 brain, and the second-highest ranked zombie gets 1 brain), but the program's logic does not account for this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
