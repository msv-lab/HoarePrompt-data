Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total sum of the array is not divisible by 3. This is a critical edge case that the program should consider. For instance, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the total sum is `15`, which is divisible by 3. However, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, the total sum is `16`, which is not divisible by 3, and the program will still attempt to find splits, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should first check if the total sum is divisible by 3 before proceeding with the calculations.
