You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Berland scientists face a very important task - given the parts of short DNA fragments, restore the dinosaur DNA! The genome of a berland dinosaur has noting in common with the genome that we've used to: it can have 26 distinct nucleotide types, a nucleotide of each type can occur at most once. If we assign distinct English letters to all nucleotides, then the genome of a Berland dinosaur will represent a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, such that each letter occurs in it at most once.

Scientists have n genome fragments that are represented as substrings (non-empty sequences of consecutive nucleotides) of the sought genome.

You face the following problem: help scientists restore the dinosaur genome. It is guaranteed that the input is not contradictory and at least one suitable line always exists. When the scientists found out that you are a strong programmer, they asked you in addition to choose the one with the minimum length. If there are multiple such strings, choose any string.

Input

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of genome fragments.

Each of the next lines contains one descriptions of a fragment. Each fragment is a non-empty string consisting of distinct small letters of the English alphabet. It is not guaranteed that the given fragments are distinct. Fragments could arbitrarily overlap and one fragment could be a substring of another one.

It is guaranteed that there is such string of distinct letters that contains all the given fragments as substrings.

Output

In the single line of the output print the genome of the minimum length that contains all the given parts. All the nucleotides in the genome must be distinct. If there are multiple suitable strings, print the string of the minimum length. If there also are multiple suitable strings, you can print any of them.

Program:
```
import sys

data = sys.stdin.read().split()
(n, i) = (int(data.pop(0)), 0)
assert len(data) == n
data = sorted(data, key=len)
genom = [data.pop()]
while data:
    next = data.pop()
    func_1(next, genom)
sys.stdout.write(''.join(genom))

def func_1(next, genom):
    for (c, chunk) in enumerate(genom):
        if next in chunk:
            return False
        if next[-1] in chunk:
            i = chunk.index(next[-1])
            for j in range(len(next) - 1, i - 1, -1):
                if chunk.startswith(next[-j:]):
                    genom[c] = next + chunk[j:]
                    return True
        if next[0] in chunk:
            i = chunk.rindex(next[0])
            for j in range(len(next) - 1, i - 1, -1):
                if chunk.endswith(next[:j]):
                    genom[c] = chunk + next[j:]
                    return True
    genom.insert(0, next)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
