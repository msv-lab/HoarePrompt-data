Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple fragments share common suffixes and prefixes. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly merge overlapping fragments to minimize the final genome length.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
abc
bce
ade
```

The expected output is `abcde`, but the program will produce `abcde` with two separate insertions of `bce` and `ade`, resulting in a longer genome than necessary. The program does not detect and merge the overlapping parts of the fragments to form the shortest possible genome.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that overlapping parts of the fragments are merged into a single continuous sequence to minimize the final genome length.
