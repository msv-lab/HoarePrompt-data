Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the k-amazing number for each k from 1 to n. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where multiple elements appear the same number of times in subsegments of the same length. Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
-1 -1 1 1 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
-1 -1 2 2 3
```

This is because the program uses a dictionary `d` to track the last occurrence of each element but does not properly update the maximum distance between occurrences for each element. This leads to incorrect values being stored in the dictionary `e`, which in turn results in incorrect k-amazing numbers being calculated.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly tracks the maximum distance between occurrences of each element in subsegments of length k. This can be achieved by maintaining a sliding window approach to keep track of the counts and positions of elements as we iterate through the array.
