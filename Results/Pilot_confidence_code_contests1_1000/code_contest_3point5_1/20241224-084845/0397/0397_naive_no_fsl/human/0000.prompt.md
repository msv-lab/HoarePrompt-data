You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n distinct points (x_1, y_1),…,(x_n,y_n) on the plane and a non-negative integer parameter k. Each point is a microscopic steel ball and k is the attract power of a ball when it's charged. The attract power is the same for all balls.

In one operation, you can select a ball i to charge it. Once charged, all balls with Manhattan distance at most k from ball i move to the position of ball i. Many balls may have the same coordinate after an operation.

More formally, for all balls j such that |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| ≤ k, we assign x_j:=x_i and y_j:=y_i.

<image> An example of an operation. After charging the ball in the center, two other balls move to its position. On the right side, the red dot in the center is the common position of those balls. 

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or report that this is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6) — the number of balls and the attract power of all balls, respectively.

The following n lines describe the balls' coordinates. The i-th of these lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^5) — the coordinates of the i-th ball.

It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.

Output

For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or -1 if it is impossible.

Example

Input


3
3 2
0 0
3 3
1 1
3 3
6 7
8 8
6 9
4 1
0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3


Output


-1
1
-1

Note

In the first test case, there are three balls at (0, 0), (3, 3), and (1, 1) and the attract power is 2. It is possible to move two balls together with one operation, but not all three balls together with any number of operations.

In the second test case, there are three balls at (6, 7), (8, 8), and (6, 9) and the attract power is 3. If we charge any ball, the other two will move to the same position, so we only require one operation.

In the third test case, there are four balls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3), and the attract power is 1. We can show that it is impossible to move all balls to the same position with a sequence of operations.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
