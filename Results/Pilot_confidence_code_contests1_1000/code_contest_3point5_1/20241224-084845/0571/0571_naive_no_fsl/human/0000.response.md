Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the variable `n` is incorrectly incremented by 1 in the line `n = int(raw_input()) + 1`. This means the program assumes an extra page exists beyond the actual number of pages in the book, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
9
1 3 3 6 7 6 8 8 9
```

The expected output is 4, as detailed in the example. However, due to the incorrect initialization of `n`, the program may incorrectly process the input, leading to an incorrect number of days calculated.

To fix this, the line `n = int(raw_input()) + 1` should be changed to `n = int(raw_input())`. This ensures that the program correctly processes the number of pages in the book without an unnecessary increment.
