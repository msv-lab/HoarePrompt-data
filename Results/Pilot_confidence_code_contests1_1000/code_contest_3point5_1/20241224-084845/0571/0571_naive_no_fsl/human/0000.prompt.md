You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan recently bought a detective book. The book is so interesting that each page of this book introduces some sort of a mystery, which will be explained later. The i-th page contains some mystery that will be explained on page a_i (a_i ≥ i).

Ivan wants to read the whole book. Each day, he reads the first page he didn't read earlier, and continues to read the following pages one by one, until all the mysteries he read about are explained and clear to him (Ivan stops if there does not exist any page i such that Ivan already has read it, but hasn't read page a_i). After that, he closes the book and continues to read it on the following day from the next page.

How many days will it take to read the whole book?

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) — the number of pages in the book.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (i ≤ a_i ≤ n), where a_i is the number of page which contains the explanation of the mystery on page i.

Output

Print one integer — the number of days it will take to read the whole book.

Example

Input


9
1 3 3 6 7 6 8 8 9


Output


4

Note

Explanation of the example test:

During the first day Ivan will read only the first page. During the second day Ivan will read pages number 2 and 3. During the third day — pages 4-8. During the fourth (and the last) day Ivan will read remaining page number 9.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input()) + 1
    a = [0] + [int(i) for i in raw_input().strip().split(' ')]
    head = 1
    ans = 0
    while head < n:
        m = a[head]
        while head < m:
            head += 1
            if head == n:
                break
            if a[head] > m:
                m = a[head]
        ans += 1
        head += 1
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
