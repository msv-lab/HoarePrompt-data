Create a program that outputs all leap years between the year a and year b.

The leap year conditions are as follows. However, 0 <a â‰¤ b <3,000. If there is no leap year in the given period, output "NA".

* The year is divisible by 4.
* However, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
* However, a year divisible by 400 is a leap year.



Input

Given multiple datasets. The format of each dataset is as follows:

Input ends when both a and b are 0. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Output

Print the year or NA for each dataset.

Insert one blank line between the datasets.
