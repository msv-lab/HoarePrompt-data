The new PIN is hard to remember. I was told that I shouldn't take notes, but I don't think I can remember them. Therefore, I decided to embed a numerical value in the text and make a note of the PIN. Here, the sum of all the numbers is the PIN.

Create a program that reads the memorandum and outputs the PIN code.



Input

Sentences with embedded positive integers are given over multiple lines. Each line is a character string containing single-byte alphanumeric characters, symbols, and spaces, or a blank line. However, you are guaranteed to enter no more than 80 characters per line and a PIN of 10,000 or less.

Output

The PIN (the sum of positive integers in the text) is output on one line.

Example
