You are given a permutation p_1,p_2,...,p_N consisting of 1,2,..,N. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Operation: Swap two adjacent elements in the permutation.

You want to have p_i ≠ i for all 1≤i≤N. Find the minimum required number of operations to achieve this.

Constraints

* 2≤N≤10^5
* p_1,p_2,..,p_N is a permutation of 1,2,..,N.
