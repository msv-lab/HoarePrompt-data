Assume that a, b, and n are all positive integers. Let f (i) be the i-th fraction of the fraction a / b (0 ≤ f (i) ≤ 9). At this time, let s be the sum of f (i) from i = 1 to n.

s = f (1) + f (2) + ... + f (n)


Create a program that reads a, b, n, outputs s, and exits.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. For each dataset, three integers a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10000), n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) are given on one line, separated by blanks.

The number of datasets does not exceed 100.

Output

Prints s on one line for each dataset.
