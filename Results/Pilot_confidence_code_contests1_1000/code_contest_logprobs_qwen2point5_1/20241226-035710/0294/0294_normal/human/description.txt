There are N children, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

They have decided to share K candies among themselves. Here, for each i (1 \leq i \leq N), Child i must receive between 0 and a_i candies (inclusive). Also, no candies should be left over.

Find the number of ways for them to share candies, modulo 10^9 + 7. Here, two ways are said to be different when there exists a child who receives a different number of candies.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 0 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 0 \leq a_i \leq K
