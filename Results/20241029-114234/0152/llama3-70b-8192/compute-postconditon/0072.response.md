Given the initial state and the loop's code, let's analyze the potential output states:

### Loop executes 1 time:
Initial State: `s_left` is `s - b[i]`, `j` is 0
```
s_left -= d[j]
j += 1
```
Output State: `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[0]`, `j` is 1

### Loop executes 2 times:
Initial State: `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[0]`, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]`
```
s_left -= d[j]
j += 1
```
Output State: `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[0] - d[1]`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]`

### Loop executes 3 times:
Initial State: `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[0] - d[1]`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[2]`
```
s_left -= d[j]
j += 1
```
Output State: `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[0] - d[1] - d[2]`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than 2, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[2]`

### Analyzing the final output state:
The loop continues to execute as long as `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]`. Therefore, the loop can terminate under two conditions:
1. `j` reaches the value of `k`.
2. `s_left` becomes less than `d[j]`.

If the loop terminates because `j` reaches `k`, then:
- `s_left` is `s - b[i] - sum(d[0] to d[k-1])`
- `j` is `k`

If the loop terminates because `s_left` becomes less than `d[j]`, then:
- `s_left` is some value `s - b[i] - sum(d[0] to d[j-1]) - remaining value` such that `s_left < d[j]`
- `j` is the smallest value where `s_left < d[j]`

### Edge cases:
1. If `k` is 0, the loop will not be executed:
   - `s_left` remains `s - b[i]`
   - `j` remains 0

2. If `s_left` is initially less than `d[0]`, the loop will not be executed:
   - `s_left` remains `s - b[i]`
   - `j` remains 0

### Final output state:
Output State: **If `k` is 0 or `s_left` is initially less than `d[0]`, `s_left` remains `s - b[i]` and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `s_left` will be `s - b[i] - sum(d[0] to d[j-1])` where `j` is the smallest index such that `s_left < d[j]` or `j` is equal to `k` if it reaches `k`.**
