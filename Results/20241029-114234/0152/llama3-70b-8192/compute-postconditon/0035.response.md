The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and immediately retest its condition. However, since the initial state describes logic outside of any specific loop context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the state of the variables.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, `b` is updated to `a - b`. If `a` equals `b`, `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b - a`. This logic handles all boundary conditions where `a` and `b` can be any integers, including negative and zero values.**
