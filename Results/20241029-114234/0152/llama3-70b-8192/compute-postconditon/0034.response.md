Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    b = a - b
elif a == b:
    b = 0
else:
    b = b - a

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` and `b` are integers. `b` is updated to `a - b`
Postcondition for else body: If `a` equals `b`, `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b - a`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, `b` is updated to `a - b`. If `a` equals `b`, `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b - a`. This logic handles all boundary conditions where `a` and `b` can be any integers, including negative and zero values.**
