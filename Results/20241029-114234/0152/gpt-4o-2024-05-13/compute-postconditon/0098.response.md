The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or `if` statement it is directly inside. The values of `i`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` do not change.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `j` is `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
