According to the given code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i < 0` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. 

To ensure the loop will execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 after being increased by 1. This means that `i` must have been less than -1 before the increment. 

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **variable `i` is less than -1**
