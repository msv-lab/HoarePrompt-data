RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The function does not correctly handle the case where Anton uses both types of spells optimally. Specifically, the function does not consider the scenario where using a second type spell first (to reduce the number of potions needed) might allow Anton to use a first type spell that he otherwise could not afford. The code only considers the use of the first type spell first and then checks if the remaining mana points can afford any second type spells. The function should also check the reverse scenario to ensure the minimum time is achieved.
