`i` is assigned the next value of `iter_i`, which is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1` decreasing by `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1` decreasing by `1`; `i` is the next value of `iter_i`.
