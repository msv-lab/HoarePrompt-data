Given that the `while` loop is `while True:`, it means that the loop is designed to run indefinitely until an explicit break condition or exit is encountered. In this case, the loop can certainly execute one more time, so we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; if the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted, `i` is the next value from `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, the loop or if statement containing the `try` block is exited.**
