Since the provided `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, according to the instruction, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; if the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted, `i` is the next value from `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement containing the `try` block.**
