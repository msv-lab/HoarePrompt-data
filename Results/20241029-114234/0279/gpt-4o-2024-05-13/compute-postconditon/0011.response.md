To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables involved.

Given:
- The `while` loop condition is `i < t`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `v1` and `v2` are input integers.
  - `t` and `d` are new input integers.
  - `speeds` is a list where:
    - The first element is `v1`.
    - The second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
    - The third element is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
    - The last element is `v2`.
    - The rest are zeros with length `t`.
  - `i` is 3.
  - `t` is greater than 2.

Now, let's analyze the while loop condition:

1. The loop condition is `i < t`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `t` is greater than 2.

Given that `i` is 3 and `t` is greater than 2, `i` is already less than `t`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time based on the current value of `i` and `t`.

Since `t` is already greater than 2 and `i` is 3, which satisfies the loop condition, no other states need to be adjusted. The current state ensures that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 2**
