`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 30, `m` will be an integer between 1 and 30, and `r` will be an integer between 1 and 1000. The lists `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers such that each 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that each 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers such that each 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that each 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000**
