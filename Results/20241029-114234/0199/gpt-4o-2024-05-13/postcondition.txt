`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, based on the `remaining_kvass`, if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0 after the loop, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and `min_keg_volume` is printed.
