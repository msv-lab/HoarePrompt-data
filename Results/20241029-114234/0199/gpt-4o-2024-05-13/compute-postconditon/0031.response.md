To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Let's analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is less than -2
- `s` is an input integer
- `volumes` is a sorted list of integers
- `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`
- `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`
- `remaining_kvass` is an input integer
- Variable `i` is increased by 1

Given that `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than 0 for the loop to execute again. If `i` was less than 0 before the increment, we need to verify its state after the increment. 

So, at the end of the last iteration, if `i` was increased by 1 and we need `i` to be less than 0 for the loop to continue, we should consider the initial value of `i` before the increment:

- If `i` was initially `-1`, after incrementing by 1, `i` becomes `0`, which does not satisfy the `i < 0` condition.
- Therefore, `i` must be at least `-2` before the increment for the loop to execute another iteration.

Thus, `i` must be less than `-1` at the end of the last iteration to ensure that it is less than 0 before the next iteration starts.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, variable `i` is less than -1**
