`mid` is assigned the value `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The values of `n`, `s`, `v`, `low`, and `high` are not affected directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is (low + high + 1) // 2.
