`low` is assigned the value `0`, and `high` is assigned the value `min(v)`, where `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in `v`**
