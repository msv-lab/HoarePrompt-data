According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to 1 since the loop starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than `i`. Thus, to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute the next time, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 + 9 * 10 * (10`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
