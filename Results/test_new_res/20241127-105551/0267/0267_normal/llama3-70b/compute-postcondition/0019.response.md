Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `k` is not equal to 0, and the pair (n, k) is not present in the dp collection. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the value of `MOD`.***
