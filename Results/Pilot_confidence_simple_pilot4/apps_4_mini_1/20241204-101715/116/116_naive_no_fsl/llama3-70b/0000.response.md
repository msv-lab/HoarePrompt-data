To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. There are three species: rocks (`r`), scissors (`s`), and papers (`p`).
2. The goal is to compute the probability that each species will be the only one to survive after many encounters.
3. The encounters follow specific rules: 
   - Rock kills scissors.
   - Scissors kill paper.
   - Paper kills rock.
4. The output must be three space-separated real numbers corresponding to the probabilities of rocks, scissors, and papers surviving, respectively.
5. The relative or absolute error of each probability must not exceed \(10^{-9}\).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input and assigns them to `r`, `s`, and `p`.
2. **Initial Probabilities**:
   - The program checks if one species is strictly greater than the others and assigns a probability of `1` to that species and `0` to the others.
   - This could be problematic because ties (where two or more species have the same highest count) are not handled correctly.
3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - If there is no clear winner, the program calculates the probabilities for each species based on the formula provided.
   - However, the formulas used to calculate the probabilities are not correct for a scenario where multiple species have the potential to win, especially in tie conditions.

### Identifying Issues:
- **Tie Handling**: The program currently does not handle cases where two or more species have equal maximum counts. For instance, if `r = 2`, `s = 2`, and `p = 1`, it should not assign a definitive probability to rocks or scissors, since both have the same chance of winning. It should potentially handle them differently instead of calculating probabilities based solely on the current counts.
  
- **Example Case**:
  - Consider the input `2 2 1`. The expected outcome should involve recalculating probabilities based on the possible interactions between rocks and scissors, rather than giving an immediate win to rocks or scissors. The current logic will not correctly reflect the probabilities in this case, leading to inaccurate results.

### Conclusion:
Given the handling of ties is missing and can lead to incorrect outputs, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
