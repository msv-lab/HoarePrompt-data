To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze its logic and the way it implements the probability calculations based on the rules of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers \( r \), \( s \), and \( p \) which represent the number of rocks, scissors, and papers respectively.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The program initializes a 3D list `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the probability of a configuration with \( i \) rocks, \( j \) scissors, and \( k \) papers.
   - It starts with `dp[r][s][p] = 1.0`, indicating that with all individuals present, the probability is 1.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The nested loops iterate backwards through the possible counts of rocks, scissors, and papers. 
   - The probability of one species eliminating another is correctly calculated by checking the number of interactions possible (i.e., \( i \times j \) for rocks and scissors).
   - The updates to `dp[i - 1][j][k]`, `dp[i][j - 1][k]`, and `dp[i][j][k - 1]` handle the transitions appropriately based on which species could be eliminated.

4. **Final Probability Summation**:
   - After populating the `dp` table, the program sums the probabilities for all possible states where only one species remains (i.e., only rocks, only scissors, or only papers).

### Edge Cases:
- The program needs to handle cases where any of \( r \), \( s \), or \( p \) might be zero, as the rules of the game dictate that no interactions can occur if any species is missing.

### Potential Issue:
While the program seems to handle the general case of three species adequately, it's essential to consider the edge case where one or more of the species start with zero individuals. In such scenarios:

- If \( r = 0 \), \( s = 0 \), or \( p = 0 \), the program should output the probabilities reflecting that only the non-zero species can survive. For example:
  - Input: `0 2 2` should yield `0.000000000000 0.500000000000 0.500000000000` (since only scissors and paper are present).
  
The current implementation does not explicitly handle cases where one or more species have zero individuals at the beginning. The absence of this handling could lead to incorrect probabilities being calculated since the sum of interactions would not be properly managed in those edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the reasoning above, the program is not comprehensive enough to guarantee correctness in all scenarios defined by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

An example where it fails is: for input `0 2 2`, it would not give the expected output of `0.000000000000 0.500000000000 0.500000000000`.
