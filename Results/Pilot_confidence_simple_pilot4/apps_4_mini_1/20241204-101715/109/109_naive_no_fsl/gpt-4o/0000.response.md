Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that you can replace any character of the string `s` with the next character in alphabetical order to obtain a string that contains the sequence of the English alphabet as a subsequence. However, the program only checks if the string `s` already contains the English alphabet as a subsequence without performing any character replacements.

For example, consider the input `"abcxyz"`. The program will output `-1`, even though it is possible to transform the `x`, `y`, and `z` characters into `d`, `e`, and `f` respectively. Thus the required output should have been `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` since we can perform the required transformations.

Hence, due to the failure to account for the character replacements specified in the problem, the program is incorrect.
