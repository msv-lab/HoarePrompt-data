You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string a of length m is called antipalindromic iff m is even, and for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) a_{i} ≠ a_{m} - i + 1.

Ivan has a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters; n is even. He wants to form some string t that will be an antipalindromic permutation of s. Also Ivan has denoted the beauty of index i as b_{i}, and the beauty of t as the sum of b_{i} among all indices i such that s_{i} = t_{i}.

Help Ivan to determine maximum possible beauty of t he can get.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, n is even) — the number of characters in s.

The second line contains the string s itself. It consists of only lowercase Latin letters, and it is guaranteed that its letters can be reordered to form an antipalindromic string.

The third line contains n integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 100), where b_{i} is the beauty of index i.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the maximum possible beauty of t.

Program:
```
n = int(input())
s = input()
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
s_sorted = sorted(s)
b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)
t = ''
for i in range(n // 2):
    t += s_sorted[i]
    t += s_sorted[n - i - 1]
max_beauty = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == t[i]:
        max_beauty += b_sorted[i]
print(max_beauty)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
