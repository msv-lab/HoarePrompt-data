You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nick had received an awesome array of integers $a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ as a gift for his $5$ birthday from his mother. He was already going to explore its various properties but after unpacking he was disappointed a lot because the product $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots a_n$ of its elements seemed to him not large enough.

He was ready to throw out the array, but his mother reassured him. She told him, that array would not be spoiled after the following operation: choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and do $a_i := -a_i - 1$.

For example, he can change array $[3, -1, -4, 1]$ to an array $[-4, -1, 3, 1]$ after applying this operation to elements with indices $i=1$ and $i=3$. 

Kolya had immediately understood that sometimes it's possible to increase the product of integers of the array a lot. Now he has decided that he wants to get an array with the maximal possible product of integers using only this operation with its elements (possibly zero, one or more times, as many as he wants), it is not forbidden to do this operation several times for the same index. 

Help Kolya and print the array with the maximal possible product of elements $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots a_n$ which can be received using only this operation in some order.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$) — number of integers in the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($-10^{6} \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}$) — elements of the array


-----Output-----

Print $n$ numbers — elements of the array with the maximal possible product of elements which can be received using only this operation in some order from the given array.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2 2 2 2

Output
-3 -3 -3 -3 
Input
1
0

Output
0 
Input
3
-3 -3 2

Output
-3 -3 2
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
cnt_neg = 0
cnt_zero = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] < 0:
        cnt_neg += 1
    elif a[i] == 0:
        cnt_zero += 1
if cnt_neg % 2 == 1:
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > 0:
            a[i] = -a[i] - 1
else:
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < 0:
            a[i] = -a[i] - 1
for i in range(n):
    print(a[i], end=' ')
print()
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
