You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).
Program:
```
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))
max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n
total_pairs_needed = 0
for soldiers in groups:
    total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
if total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
