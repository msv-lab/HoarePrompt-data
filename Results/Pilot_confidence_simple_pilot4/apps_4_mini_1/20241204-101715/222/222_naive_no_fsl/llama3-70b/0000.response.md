To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The objective is to determine the minimum number of actions required for Miroslav to turn over all `n` skewers, where each action affects `k` skewers on either side of the chosen skewer as well as the skewer itself.

### Key Points of the Logic:
1. The number of skewers turned over in one action is `(k * 2 + 1)`, which includes the skewer itself and `k` skewers on each side.
2. The program computes the minimum number of actions needed to cover all `n` skewers using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
3. The list `res` is populated by choosing skewers in steps of `(k * 2 + 1)` starting from skewer `1`.

### Test Case Analysis
Let's analyze a few scenarios to check if the implementation meets the requirements:

1. **Example Case (n=7, k=2)**:
   - Total skewers: 7
   - Skewers affected per action: 5 (2 on each side + the skewer itself)
   - Required actions calculated: \( l = (7 + 2 - 1) // 5 = 1 \)
   - Chosen skewer: `1`
   - This will affect skewers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, leaving `6, 7` unaffected.
   - A second action would be needed to cover skewers `6` and `7`, which is missed by the program.

2. **Example Case (n=5, k=1)**:
   - Total skewers: 5
   - Skewers affected per action: 3 (1 on each side + the skewer itself)
   - Required actions calculated: \( l = (5 + 1 - 1) // 3 = 2 \)
   - Chosen skewers: `1` and `4`
   - This will affect skewers `1, 2, 3` and `4, 5`, covering all.

### Error Identification
In the first test case (n = 7, k = 2), the program fails to account for covering all skewers as the logic only considers the first skewer in the series and does not correctly compute subsequent skewers when there are leftovers. Thus, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers.

### Conclusion
Given that the implementation is incorrect for certain inputs (specifically when the skewers are not fully covered), we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not consistently provide the correct number of actions required for all cases described in the problem statement.
