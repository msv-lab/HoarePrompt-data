To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can break down the requirements and the code's logic step-by-step.

The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:

1. \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
2. \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
2. **Area Calculation**: The area is computed as \(area = n * m / k\). If `area` is not an integer (checked by `area != int(area)`), the program outputs "NO".
3. **Zero Area Check**: If the area is zero, it also outputs "NO".
4. **Triangle Point Generation**: If the area is valid, "YES" is printed, and the program attempts to generate three points based on the area:
   - If \(2 * area \le n\), it creates points \((0, 0)\), \((2 * area, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\).
   - If \(2 * area \le m\), it creates points \((0, 0)\), \((1, 2 * area)\), and \((1, 0)\).
   - In other cases, it creates points \((0, m // 2)\), \((n, m // 2)\), and \((0, 0)\).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as a float. Given that \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) can be as large as \(10^9\), any fractional area derived from \(nm/k\) where \(k\) does not completely divide \(nm\) would lead to an invalid area. The check for integer area is correct, but this alone does not guarantee that the area can be formed into a triangle with valid integer coordinates.
   
2. **Coordinate Validity**: The program does not always ensure that the generated points are within bounds. It assumes that generating points based on \(2 * area\) or \(m//2\) will not exceed \(n\) or \(m\) respectively, which might not always hold true. For example:
   - If \(n = 5\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\), the area becomes \(5\), and the program would generate points that potentially exceed the limits defined by \(n\) and \(m\).

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider the case:
- Input: \(n = 5\), \(m = 3\), \(k = 3\)

The calculated area would be:
\[
area = \frac{5 * 3}{3} = 5
\]
The program would then check if \(2 * area \le n\), which evaluates to \(10 \le 5\) (false), and then check \(2 * area \le m\) which evaluates to \(10 \le 3\) (false). Thus, it would proceed to the fallback option:
\[
(0, m // 2) = (0, 1) \\
(n, m // 2) = (5, 1) \\
(0, 0) = (0, 0)
\]
The points would then be \((0, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((0, 0)\), but the area formed is not equal to \(5\), and the coordinates exceed valid ranges.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases leading to potential out-of-bound coordinates or incorrect area calculation.

Therefore, the final judgement on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
