You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game with $n$ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number. The $i$-th pile has $a_i$ stones.

Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.

On a player's turn, they must choose exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $\frac{n}{2}$ nonempty piles).

Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 50$) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 50$) — the number of stones in the piles.


-----Output-----

Print a single string "Alice" if Alice wins; otherwise, print "Bob" (without double quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
8 8

Output
Bob

Input
4
3 1 4 1

Output
Alice



-----Note-----

In the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ($\frac{2}{2}=1$). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.

In the second example, Alice can remove $2$ stones from the first pile and $3$ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
alice_turn = True
while True:
    max_stones = max(a)
    if max_stones == 0:
        break
    piles_to_remove = n // 2
    piles_removed = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > 0 and piles_removed < piles_to_remove:
            a[i] -= 1
            piles_removed += 1
    alice_turn = not alice_turn
if alice_turn:
    print('Bob')
else:
    print('Alice')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
