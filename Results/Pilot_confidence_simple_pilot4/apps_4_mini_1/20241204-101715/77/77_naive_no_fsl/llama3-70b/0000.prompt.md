You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Berland Football Cup starts really soon! Commentators from all over the world come to the event.

Organizers have already built $n$ commentary boxes. $m$ regional delegations will come to the Cup. Every delegation should get the same number of the commentary boxes. If any box is left unoccupied then the delegations will be upset. So each box should be occupied by exactly one delegation.

If $n$ is not divisible by $m$, it is impossible to distribute the boxes to the delegations at the moment.

Organizers can build a new commentary box paying $a$ burles and demolish a commentary box paying $b$ burles. They can both build and demolish boxes arbitrary number of times (each time paying a corresponding fee). It is allowed to demolish all the existing boxes.

What is the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$)?


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integer numbers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^{12}$, $1 \le a, b \le 100$), where $n$ is the initial number of the commentary boxes, $m$ is the number of delegations to come, $a$ is the fee to build a box and $b$ is the fee to demolish a box.


-----Output-----

Output the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$). It is allowed that the final number of the boxes is equal to $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 7 3 8

Output
15

Input
2 7 3 7

Output
14

Input
30 6 17 19

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example organizers can build $5$ boxes to make the total of $14$ paying $3$ burles for the each of them.

In the second example organizers can demolish $2$ boxes to make the total of $0$ paying $7$ burles for the each of them.

In the third example organizers are already able to distribute all the boxes equally among the delegations, each one get $5$ boxes.
Program:
```
(n, m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
r = n % m
if r == 0:
    print(0)
elif m - r <= n:
    print(min((m - r) * a, r * b))
else:
    print((m - r) * a)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
