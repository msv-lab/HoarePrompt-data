Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple pearls and links, but the links cannot be evenly distributed between the pearls. 

For example, consider the input `-o---o-`. Here, there are 2 pearls (`o`) and 5 links (`-`). The condition `link_count % pearl_count == 0` would evaluate to `5 % 2 == 1`, which correctly outputs `NO`, since you cannot distribute 5 links evenly between 2 pearls. 

However, the program fails for the input `-o----o--`. In this case, there are 2 pearls and 8 links. The program would output `YES`, as it checks for `8 % 2 == 0`, implying you can distribute the links evenly. But actually, you cannot place 8 links between 2 pearls while maintaining equal spacing. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
