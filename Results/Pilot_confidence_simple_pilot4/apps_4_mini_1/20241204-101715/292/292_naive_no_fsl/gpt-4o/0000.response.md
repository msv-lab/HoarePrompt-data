Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the edge case described in the problem. According to the problem description, Limak's weight must become strictly larger than Bob's weight. However, the program contains a flaw when both Limak and Bob start with the same weight (for example, when `a = 1` and `b = 1`).

In this case, Limak's weight triples to 3 and Bob's weight doubles to 2 after 1 year. The program correctly returns `1` since Limak becomes larger than Bob, which adheres to the problem description.

However, consider the input where both weights are equal but slightly larger, for example, `a = 10` and `b = 10`. According to the problem description, the expected output should be `1` since after one year, Limak would weigh 30 and Bob would weigh 20, making Limak larger than Bob. The program correctly identifies this case, returning `1`.

Thus, the program is generally correct for the provided example cases. However, there is a potential edge case where the input values are equal, and the output should strictly check for "larger" rather than "equal". 

For `a = 5` and `b = 5`, for example, the program would compute Limak's weight as 15 and Bob's weight as 10 after 1 year, which is correct. However, if we consider the case where Limak starts with a lower weight than Bob but both are the same, the program logic holds. 

In conclusion, since the program does correctly handle all provided cases, I am unable to find a scenario where it fails against the description. Therefore, I had made an error in my reasoning.

Correctness: **True**

The program accurately computes the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight by following the specified growth rates. It checks on a per-year basis and correctly counts the years until Limak is strictly heavier, thus adhering to the problem requirements.
