To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze its behavior against the problem description and the provided examples.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Area Check**: The program starts by calculating the area of both chocolate bars. If the areas are not equal (`area1 != area2`), it immediately returns `-1`, which is correct as stated in the problem description since the bars cannot be equal if they don't have the same area.

2. **Normalization**: The program attempts to reduce the dimensions of both bars to their simplest form using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The intention here is to simplify the dimensions for comparison. However, the second reduction line seems incorrect:
   ```python
   g = func_1(a2, b2)
   a2 //= b2  # This should be a2 //= g instead
   b2 //= g
   ```
   This line should normalize both dimensions of the second bar by dividing by the GCD. Instead, it divides `a2` by `b2`, which is incorrect logic.

3. **Minute Count Loop**: The program enters a while loop where it attempts to reduce the dimensions of the bars to make them equal. It does this by halving or reducing by a third if possible. However, the loop's logic may result in an infinite loop in certain configurations because it only checks one dimension at a time and assumes the other dimension is unchanging during iterations. Moreover, it may not correctly handle cases where neither dimension can be halved or reduced by a third.

4. **Output Conditions**: After the loop, if the dimensions are equal, it prints the number of minutes and the final dimensions. If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Potential Failing Case

One case that demonstrates the program's incorrectness is:
```plaintext
Input:
5 3
3 5
```

Expected:
- The areas are different (15 vs. 15), so the program should return dimensions to normalize both bars.
However, the normalization logic fails because of the incorrect division in the GCD part.

Therefore, the program does not properly handle all potential cases, particularly failing in the normalization step and not addressing possible infinite loops correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
