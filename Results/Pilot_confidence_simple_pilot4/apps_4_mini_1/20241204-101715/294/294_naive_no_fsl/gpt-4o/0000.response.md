To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to find all pairs of integers (n, m) such that the total number of distinct squares in an n × m table equals a given integer x.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Loop over n**: The program iterates over all possible values of n from 1 to the integer value of the square root of x. This is a reasonable upper bound for n since for larger values, the number of squares will not reach x.
  
2. **Inner Loop for m**: For each n, the inner loop initializes m to 0 and continues incrementing m to calculate the total number of squares until it either matches x or surpasses it. The total squares for given n and m is computed using the formula:
   \[
   \text{total\_squares} += (n - m + 1) \times (m - n + 1)
   \]
   This logic appears incorrect:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of distinct squares seems flawed, as it does not accurately represent the number of squares of different sizes in an n \times m grid.

3. **Appending Results**: If at any point the total squares equals x, the pair (n, m) is added to the results list.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the count of results and the list of pairs sorted by the specified criteria.

### Potential Issues:
- The formula for `total_squares` does not correctly represent the number of distinct squares for varying sizes. For a fixed n and m, the number of k × k squares that can fit inside an n × m rectangle is given by the minimum of (n - k + 1) and (m - k + 1) for all possible sizes k. The provided formula does not handle this correctly, leading to potentially incorrect counts of squares.

### Example Case:
Let’s take an example where x = 1. The expected output should be:
- For (1, 1), there is exactly 1 square.
However, looking at the inner working of the code, the conditions set for calculating total squares does not guarantee it will correctly identify all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not adhere to the problem's requirements due to the flawed logic in calculating the total number of distinct squares for given n and m. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
