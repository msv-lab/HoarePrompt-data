Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It determines the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the required ratio of 1:2:4.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`), which are all positive integers between 1 and 1000. This adheres to the problem constraints.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The variable `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of:
   - `a` (the number of lemons available),
   - `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples, since each lemon requires 2 apples), and
   - `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears, since each lemon requires 4 pears).
   This accurately reflects the constraints needed to maintain the ratio.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is computed as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`. This correctly sums the total fruits based on the optimal number of lemons that can be used.

4. **Output**: The output is printed correctly as the total number of fruits used in the compote.

The provided examples all confirm that the program works as expected, producing the correct output for the specified cases. There are no edge cases readily apparent that the program does not handle, thus supporting the correctness of the implementation.
