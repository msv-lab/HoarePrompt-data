To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

The task is to swap elements in an array to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n). The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic in the provided program:

1. The program reads the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation array `a`.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum value (1) and the maximum value (n) in the array.
3. It calculates the distances from the minimum and maximum positions to both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).
4. It then determines the maximum distance possible by considering swaps that place the minimum at one end and the maximum at the opposite end.
5. Finally, it prints this maximum distance.

However, the program has an oversight. While it does calculate potential distances, it does not correctly account for the requirement to perform exactly one swap to achieve the maximum distance. Specifically, the program does not consider swapping the positions of the minimum and maximum elements themselves.

### Example Test Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case:
- The minimum (1) is at index 0, and the maximum (5) is at index 4.
- The distance is already 4 (from index 0 to index 4).
- However, the program will calculate distances as follows:
  - `dist1 = abs(0 - 4) = 4` (min at left and max at right)
  - `dist2 = abs(4 - 4) = 0` (this is wrong, irrelevant)
  - `dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0` (this is wrong, irrelevant)
  - `dist4 = abs(4 - 0) = 4` (the other irrelevant one)

The maximum distance calculated is `4`, which is correct in this case, but if we change the input to:
```
5
1 3 5 4 2
```
- The minimum is at index 0, the maximum is at index 2.
- If we swap 1 and 2, the minimum moves to the end, and the maximum moves closer to the start:
  - The distance would be 4 (from index 0 to index 4).
  
However, the program does not check all possible swaps effectively and could miss cases that yield a larger final distance.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description to maximize distance after exactly one swap, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
