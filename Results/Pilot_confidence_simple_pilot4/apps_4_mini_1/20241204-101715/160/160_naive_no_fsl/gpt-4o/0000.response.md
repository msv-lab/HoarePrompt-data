To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description about transforming an array into a co-prime array.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if two numbers are co-prime by computing their greatest common divisor (GCD) and returning `True` if it is 1.
  
2. The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.

3. It initializes a `result` list with the first element of `a` and a `count` variable to keep track of the number of elements added.

4. It then iterates over each element in `a`, starting from the second element. For each element:
   - It checks if the last element added to `result` and the current element of `a` are co-prime.
   - If they are not co-prime, it adds a `1` (which is always co-prime with any integer) to `result` and increments the count.
   - It then appends the current element of `a` to `result`.

5. Finally, it prints the count of added elements and the resulting array.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program only inserts `1` when two adjacent elements are not co-prime. However, it does not account for the possibility that inserting a different positive integer might be more optimal in some cases. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   3
   8 10 12
   ```
   In this case:
   - `8` and `10` are not co-prime. The program would insert `1`, resulting in `1 8 10`, which is not co-prime because `1` and `10` are co-prime, but `8` and `10` are not.
   - The optimal solution here would be to insert a number such as `9` between `8` and `10`, resulting in `8 9 10` which satisfies the co-prime condition.

2. Additionally, the program does not handle scenarios where multiple insertions might be required effectively, leading to incorrect outputs in certain cases.

Given this analysis, it becomes clear that while the program might work for some specific inputs, it does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the resulting array satisfies the co-prime conditions for all possible inputs. Specifically, it fails in cases where inserting a number other than `1` would be necessary to achieve co-primality.

Correctness: **False**
