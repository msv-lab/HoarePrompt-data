The code assigns `full_cycles` to `max_questions`. Given the initial state, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`. This means `max_questions` will take on the same value as `full_cycles`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k % m`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`, and `max_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`**
