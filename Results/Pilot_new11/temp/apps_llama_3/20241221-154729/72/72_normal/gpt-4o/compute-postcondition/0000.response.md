The given code assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` using the `map` function. The input is split into five values, and these values are converted to integers.

Since `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input, we need to consider the constraints provided by the input operation. The input operation does not explicitly restrict the range of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` within the given code, but based on the initial state, we know `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100, `k` is between 1 and 10^18, and `x` and `y` are within the ranges of `n` and `m`, respectively.

However, once the input is provided, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` take on the exact values from the input, which may or may not adhere to the initial constraints. Therefore, after the execution of the given code:

- `n` is an integer input value.
- `m` is an integer input value.
- `k` is an integer input value.
- `x` is an integer input value.
- `y` is an integer input value.

But considering the initial constraints and assuming the input does adhere to these initial constraints for a meaningful execution:

- `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) as per input.
- `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) as per input.
- `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive) as per input.
- `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive) as per input.
- `y` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `m` (inclusive) as per input.

Given the direct assignment from input, the actual ranges of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are determined by the input values. However, for a constrained and meaningful interpretation based on the provided initial state:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `y` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `m` (inclusive), where these values are directly assigned from the input.**
