The code assigns a value to `full_cycle_length`. The value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `m`. 

Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), when `n` is 1, `full_cycle_length` is `m`. When `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, which means it is a multiple of `m` and depends on the values of `n` and `m`. 

The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`.**
