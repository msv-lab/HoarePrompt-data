According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer, and `result` is 0. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 digit and the first digit is available for the loop to start.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is 0**
