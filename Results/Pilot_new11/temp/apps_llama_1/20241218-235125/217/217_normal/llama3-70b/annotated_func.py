#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is well-formed, consisting of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b, c = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `a`, `c` is the sum of all elements at odd indices in `a`.
    print(b - c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lines of input: the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` (-100 ≤ `a_{i}` ≤ 100). After processing the input, the function sorts the `n` integers in descending order and calculates two sums: `b` is the sum of all elements at even indices, and `c` is the sum of all elements at odd indices. The function then returns the difference between `b` and `c` (`b - c`). The final state of the program is that it has printed this difference to the console. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is 1, in which case it will return the single integer, and when `n` is even or odd, in which case it will correctly calculate the sums `b` and `c` based on the sorted list.
