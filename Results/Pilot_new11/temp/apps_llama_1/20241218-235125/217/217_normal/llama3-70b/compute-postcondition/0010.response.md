According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be one less than the current value of `n` for the loop to have executed at least once. So, `i` is increased by 1. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the loop has executed at least once, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

The state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop counter. 

If the new `i` is even, `b` is equal to `a[0]` and `c` is 0. If the new `i` is odd, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `a[i]`.

State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i+1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, if `i+1` is even, `b` is equal to `a[0]` and `c` is 0, if `i+1` is odd, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `a[i+1]`, `i` is `i+1`**
