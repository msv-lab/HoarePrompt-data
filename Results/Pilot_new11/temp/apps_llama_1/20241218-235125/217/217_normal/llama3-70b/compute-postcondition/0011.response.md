The code `b += a[i]` increments the value of `b` by the value of `a[i]`. 

Given that `i` is `i+1`, we need to consider two cases based on the parity of the new value of `i+1`. 

If `i+1` is even, `b` was initially equal to `a[0]` and `c` is 0. 

If `i+1` is odd, `b` was initially 0 and `c` is equal to `a[i+1]`. 

However, since `i` is now `i+1`, the condition for `i+1` being even or odd has changed. 

We need to consider the updated value of `i`. Since `n` is greater than `i+1`, and `i` is now `i+1`, the new `i` is still less than `n`. 

The value of `a[i]` is added to `b`. 

The list `a` is in descending order, so the value of `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[0]`. 

The value of `b` becomes `b + a[i]`. 

If the initial `i+1` was even, `b` was `a[0]`, so now `b` is `a[0] + a[i]`. 

If the initial `i+1` was odd, `b` was 0, so now `b` is `a[i]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
the input is well-formed, 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i`, 
`a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, 
`i` is `i+1`, 
if the initial `i+1` was even, `b` is `a[0] + a[i]` and `c` is 0, 
if the initial `i+1` was odd, `b` is `a[i]`, `c` is equal to `a[i+1]`.

Output State: **the input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `i` is `i+1`, if the initial `i+1` was even, `b` is `a[0] + a[i]` and `c` is 0, if the initial `i+1` was odd, `b` is `a[i]`, `c` is equal to `a[i+1]`**
