The given code is `n = int(input())`, where `n` will hold the value of an input integer. The initial state provides that the first line of input will contain one integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100). 

The code will take an integer as input and assign it to the variable `n`. 

Since the value of `n` is dependent on the input, it can be any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

The output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive**
