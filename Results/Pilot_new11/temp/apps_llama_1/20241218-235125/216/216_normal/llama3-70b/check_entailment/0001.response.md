Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. The program simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between positions from the set.

A counterexample to this program is the string "aAa". The program would output 3, which is incorrect because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions for this string is 1. The condition for a pretty set is not met if we include all the lowercase letters as they are not distinct or have uppercase letters between them.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible subsets of the lowercase letters and check if they meet the conditions of a pretty set. We can do this by iterating over all possible subsets of the lowercase letter positions and checking if the letters at these positions are distinct and if there are no uppercase letters between them. 

Here's a simple example in Python of how the correct program could look like:

```python
def max_pretty_set():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_size = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        subset = []
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)) and s[i].islower():
                subset.append(i)
        if is_pretty(subset, s):
            max_size = max(max_size, len(subset))
    print(max_size)

def is_pretty(subset, s):
    if not subset:
        return True
    subset.sort()
    for i in range(len(subset) - 1):
        if s[subset[i+1]] == s[subset[i]]:
            return False
        for j in range(subset[i]+1, subset[i+1]):
            if s[j].isupper():
                return False
    return True
```
This program checks all possible subsets of positions in the string, filters out the ones that meet the conditions of a pretty set, and keeps track of the maximum size of such a subset.
