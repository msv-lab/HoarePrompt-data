Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set" of positions in the string, where a pretty set is defined as a set of positions such that:

1. Letters on positions from the set are all distinct and lowercase.
2. There are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from the set.

The provided program simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not guarantee that the positions of these letters form a pretty set. The program does not check for distinctness of the letters at the positions or ensure that there are no uppercase letters between positions.

For example, consider the input string "aaaa". The program would output 4, which is the total number of lowercase letters, but the maximum number of elements in a pretty set would be 1 because there are no distinct lowercase letters and the positions of the 'a's are all adjacent.

To solve this problem correctly, the program would need to consider all possible subsets of the positions of lowercase letters in the string and check which ones satisfy the conditions of a pretty set. It would then return the size of the largest such subset. The provided program does not implement this logic, so it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
