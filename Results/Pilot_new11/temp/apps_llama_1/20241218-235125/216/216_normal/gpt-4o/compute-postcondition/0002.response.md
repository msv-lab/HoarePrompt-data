The given code initializes a new variable `max_count` and assigns it the value 0. The initial state variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this code. 

The value of `max_count` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `max_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `max_count` is 0**
