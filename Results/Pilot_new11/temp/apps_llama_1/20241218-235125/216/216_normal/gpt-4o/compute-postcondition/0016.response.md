According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters and `char` is the second character in the string.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string**
