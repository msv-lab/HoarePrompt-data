Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes`) and downvotes (`min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes`) based on the input integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the result may be uncertain if there are unknown persons who may vote up or down.

2. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes (`max_upvotes < min_downvotes`), it prints a '-'. This is correct because it means that even if all unknown persons vote up, there will still be more downvotes than upvotes.
   - If the minimum possible upvotes are greater than the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes < min_upvotes`), it prints a '+'. This is also correct because it means that even if all unknown persons vote down, there will still be more upvotes than downvotes.

3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints a '?'. This is correct because it means that the result is uncertain, i.e., there are possible scenarios where the number of upvotes is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of downvotes, depending on how the unknown persons vote.

The program handles all possible cases specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each case. Therefore, it is correct. 

In the given examples, the program will produce the correct output:
- For the input `3 7 0`, it will print `-` because `max_upvotes` (3) is less than `min_downvotes` (7).
- For the input `2 0 1`, it will print `+` because `max_downvotes` (1) is less than `min_upvotes` (2).
- For the input `1 1 0`, it will print `0` because neither of the conditions is met, but since `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, it should actually be `0`. The program will correctly print `?` for the input `0 0 1` because the result is uncertain. However, in this specific case, when `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, it should actually print `?`, but when `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, it should print `0`. So the program will need an extra condition to check if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, then print `0`.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            if x == y and z == 0:
                print('0')
            else:
                print('?')
```
This way, the program correctly handles the case when `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, and prints `0` as required.
