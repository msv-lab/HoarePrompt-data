Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the voting based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. The function calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes and then prints the corresponding character: '-', '+' or '?'.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the logic behind the program. The code handles all potential edge cases where the input integers may be at their minimum or maximum values within the specified range.

The program description provides examples that the code handles correctly. For instance:

- Input: 3 7 0, Output: -, which is correct since there are more downvotes than upvotes.
- Input: 2 0 1, Output: +, which is correct since there are more upvotes than downvotes regardless of the unknown vote.
- Input: 1 1 0, Output: 0, which is correct since there are equal upvotes and downvotes.
- Input: 0 0 1, Output:?, which is correct since the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown vote.

The code does not have any obvious flaws or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It assumes that the input will be valid and within the specified range, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement.
