The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` by taking an input string, splitting it into three parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning these integers to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, and the code updates their values based on user input, the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are the input integers.

However, there is no constraint in the code that limits the input integers to be within the range `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. Therefore, after executing the code, `x`, `y`, and `z` can take any integer values based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers**
