Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `x + z` is less than `y`, then the state remains as is. If `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`, then if `y + z` is less than `x`, '+' has been printed; otherwise, if `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`, '?' has been printed.***
