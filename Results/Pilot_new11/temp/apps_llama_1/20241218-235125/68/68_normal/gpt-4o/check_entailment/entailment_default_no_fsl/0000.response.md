Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the input integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. The code then uses these calculated values to determine the output character, which can be '+', '-', or '?', depending on whether the result is certain or uncertain.

The code handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples. For instance, if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it correctly prints '-'. Similarly, if the minimum possible upvotes are greater than the maximum possible downvotes, it prints '+'. In all other cases, where the outcome could be either '+', '-', or '0' depending on how the unknown votes are cast, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty.

The code also aligns with the output hints provided, which describe the conditions under which each of the output characters is printed. The comparison logic in the code ensures that it covers all possible scenarios for the input integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, within the specified range of 0 to 100.

Moreover, the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. For example, the input (3, 7, 0) results in '-', (2, 0, 1) results in '+', (1, 1, 0) results in '0', and (0, 0, 1) results in '?', all of which match the expected outputs described in the problem.

Given that the code accurately implements the logic described in the problem, handles all provided examples correctly, and covers the comparison logic as outlined in the output hints, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct for every potential case as per the problem description.
