Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` is 0, the state of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains as is; if `z` is greater than 0, a '?' has been printed and `x`, `y`, and `z` are still non-negative integers with `x` equal to `y`. If `x` does not equal `y`, then a '?' has been printed to the console.**
