Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, the code prints '?' without considering the possibility that all unknown votes could be downvotes, which would result in a tie (0) if `x` equals `y + z`. However, a more straightforward counterexample is when `x` is greater than `y` but less than `y + z`. In such cases, if all unknown votes are downvotes, the result would be a tie or '-', but if all unknown votes are upvotes, the result would be '+'. Thus, the correct output should be '?' because there are multiple possible outcomes. However, the given code does not correctly handle this scenario.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the conditions to check for the uncertainty of the outcome based on the range of possible votes. Specifically, we should print '?' whenever there's a possibility of more than one outcome due to the unknown votes, which includes scenarios where `x` could be equal to `y + z` (leading to a tie if all unknowns vote down) or where the difference between `x` and `y` is less than or equal to `z` (since the unknown votes could sway the outcome in either direction).

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x + z < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
```

This corrected function checks if `x` is greater than `y + z` (guaranteeing a '+'), if `x + z` is less than `y` (guaranteeing a '-'), or if `x` equals `y` with no unknown votes (guaranteeing a '0'). In all other cases, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty in the outcome.
