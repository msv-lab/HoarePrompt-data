Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. 

For example, consider the case where x = 5, y = 3, and z = 2. In this case, if all unknown votes are upvotes, the result will be "+", but if one unknown vote is an upvote and the other is a downvote, the result will still be "+". However, if both unknown votes are downvotes, the result will be "0". Therefore, this case should print "?" because there are two possible results: "+" and "0". 

However, the given program will print "+" because x > y, even though the actual result can be different depending on the unknown votes. 

So, the program does not handle this case correctly, and its output does not match the problem description. 

Another example is x = 2, y = 2, z = 1, in this case, the program should print "?" since if the unknown vote is upvote, the result will be "+", otherwise, it will be "0". But the program will print "?" only when x equals y and z is greater than 0. It will not handle the case when x is greater than y and x is less than or equal to y + z. 

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
