Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different scenarios:

1. If `x > y + z`, it means that even if all unknown persons downvote, the number of upvotes will still be more than the number of downvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints '+'.

2. If `x < y`, it means that even if all unknown persons upvote, the number of downvotes will still be more than the number of upvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints '-'.

3. If `x == y`, it means that the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal. If `z == 0`, there are no unknown persons, so the result is '0'. If `z > 0`, the result is uncertain because the unknown persons can either upvote or downvote, leading to different results. The program correctly handles this case.

4. If `x > y` and `x <= y + z`, the program prints '?'. This is because the unknown persons can either upvote or downvote, leading to different results. If all unknown persons upvote, the result will be '+'. If all unknown persons downvote, the result will be '-' if `y + z > x`, or '0' if `y + z == x`. This case is also handled correctly by the program.

The program covers all possible scenarios and handles them according to the problem statement. It correctly prints '+' if there are more upvotes than downvotes, '-' if there are more downvotes than upvotes, '0' if the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal, and '?' if the result is uncertain. Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs.
