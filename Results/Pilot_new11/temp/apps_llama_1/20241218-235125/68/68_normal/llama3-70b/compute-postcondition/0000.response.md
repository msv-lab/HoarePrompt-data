The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` assigns the input values to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input consists of three non-negative integers, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be assigned these integer values. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns them as a map object, which is then unpacked into `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

Given that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, after the execution of the code, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values of the three input integers.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or vote with unknown outcome, where their values are determined by the input to the program.**
