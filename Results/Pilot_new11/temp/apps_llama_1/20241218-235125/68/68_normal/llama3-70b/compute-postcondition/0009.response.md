The given code `print('0')` simply prints the string '0' to the console. This operation does not modify the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. 

The initial conditions state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers, `x` equals `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` (which is naturally true since `x` equals `y`), and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. Given `z` is 0, this implies `x` is less than or equal to `y`, which again is naturally true because `x` equals `y`. Therefore, the conditions essentially convey that `x` equals `y`, and both are non-negative integers, with `z` being 0.

Since the print statement does not alter the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition that the string '0' has been printed to the console. However, the problem format does not require tracking of outputs to the console but rather the state of variables.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` equals `y`, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `z` is 0, and the condition that `x` is less than or equal to `y + z` holds true because `z` is 0 and `x` equals `y`.

Output State: **`x` equals `y`, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `z` is 0**
