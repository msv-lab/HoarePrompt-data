Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or vote with unknown outcome, where their values are determined by the input to the program, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and `x` (which equals `y`) is greater than or equal to `y` (which is the same as `x`), in other words, `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0**
