Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen (-) has been printed to the console. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the state of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains as is; if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or if `x` is greater than `y`, a '?' has been printed to the console, and in all these cases, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still non-negative integers with `x` being either equal to or greater than `y`.***
