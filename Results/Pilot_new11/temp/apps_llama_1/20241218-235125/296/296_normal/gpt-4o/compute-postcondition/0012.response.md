To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables and their initial conditions.


The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2.
- `i` is 3.
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3.


Given the code `divisors.append(i)`, we can deduce the following:
- The value of `i` is appended to the list `divisors`. Since `i` is 3, `divisors` now includes the value 3.


The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `n` is still an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2.
- `i` remains 3.
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` is still at least 3.


However, a new condition is introduced:
- `divisors` is a list that now includes the value 3.


Therefore, considering all the information provided and the changes made by the code:


Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3, and `divisors` is a list that includes the value 3.**
