To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `divisors` is a list containing the value 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2, and `n` is a multiple of `i`. The current value of `i` is not equal to `n` divided by `i`, meaning `i` is not the square root of `n`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
divisors.append(n // i)
```
Here, `n // i` is calculated and appended to the `divisors` list. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is a multiple of `i` (hence `n` is even), `n // i` will be an integer.

Because `n` is a multiple of `i` (where `i` is 2), `n // i` equals `n / i`, which is an integer since `n` is divisible by `i` without remainder. Given that `n` is strictly larger than 2 and `i` is 2, `n // i` will be larger than 1 but not necessarily larger than `i` itself since `n` could be 4 (in which case `n // i` equals 2).

The value of `n // i` is added to the `divisors` list. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is a multiple of `i`, `n // i` is also an integer divisor of `n`.

Considering the constraints and the operation performed, the output state will be:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `divisors` is a list now containing the values 2 and `n // i` (which is `n / 2` since `i` is 2).
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` remains at least 2, as this condition is not altered by the code.
- `n` remains a multiple of `i` (where `i` is 2), as this condition is inherent in the initial state and not changed by appending a divisor to a list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, `divisors` is a list containing the values 2 and `n / 2`, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2, and `n` is a multiple of `i`.**
