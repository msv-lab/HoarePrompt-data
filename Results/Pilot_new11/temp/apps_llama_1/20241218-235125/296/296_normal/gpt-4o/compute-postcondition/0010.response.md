Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2. If `n` is a multiple of `i`, then if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, `divisors` is a list containing the values 2 and `n / 2`, otherwise `divisors` contains the value 2. If `n` is not a multiple of `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
