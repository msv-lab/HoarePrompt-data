You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Output hints: This function determines if a given integer `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, lists these divisors and their corresponding fractions. The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or has no divisors other than 1 and itself, or a string that confirms the presence of divisors, lists them, and includes their corresponding fractions. The function considers divisors up to the square root of `n`, ensuring that all divisors are found due to the mathematical property that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been accounted for. If divisors are found, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the count of divisors (including their corresponding quotients if they are not equal to the divisor), and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor as the denominator. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, and where `n` is a prime number (i.e., has no divisors other than 1 and itself), returning 'NO' in these cases.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
