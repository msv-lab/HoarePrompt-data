Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `int(math.sqrt(n))` <= `int(math.sqrt(10^9))` and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4, and `divisors` includes the values 4, 3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9, and `n // 4` if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, otherwise the state of `divisors` remains unchanged as `i` equals `n // i`.**
