According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2 and `i` is initially 2. Also, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, which is already ensured since `n` is strictly larger than 2. At the start of the loop, `divisors` is an empty list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `divisors` is an empty list, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2**
