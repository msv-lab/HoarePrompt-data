Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` from the user, checks if it equals 2, and based on this condition, prints either 'NO' or 'YES' along with additional numbers if `n` is not 2. If `n` is 2, the program only prints 'NO'. If `n` is any other positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and two pairs of numbers: '1' followed by `n // 2`, and '1' followed by `n`. The function does not return any values but modifies the console output. It handles all positive integer inputs within the specified range but does not include error handling for non-integer or out-of-range inputs.**
