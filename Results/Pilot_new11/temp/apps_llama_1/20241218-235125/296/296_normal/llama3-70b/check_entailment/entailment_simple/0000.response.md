Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

One of the requirements of the problem description is that the denominators $b_i$ must divide $n$, and $1 < b_i < n$. However, in the given program, when $n$ is not equal to 2, it prints 'YES', then prints 2, then prints $\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$. 

The issue here is that $\frac{n}{2}$ may not divide $n$ if $n$ is odd. For example, if $n = 3$, $\frac{n}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$, which is not an integer and does not divide 3.

Another issue is that the program checks if $n == 2$ and prints 'NO' in that case, which is correct. However, for other values of $n$, it simply prints $\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$ without checking if these fractions add up to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$.

To fix these issues, the program needs to find a sequence of fractions that satisfy all the conditions specified in the problem description, which is not the case with the current implementation. 

Here is a simple counter example to show the incorrectness of the program:

Input: $n = 3$

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES
2
1 1
1 3

In this case, the program prints 'YES' and then prints two fractions $\frac{1}{1}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, which do not satisfy the condition $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{3}$. 

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
