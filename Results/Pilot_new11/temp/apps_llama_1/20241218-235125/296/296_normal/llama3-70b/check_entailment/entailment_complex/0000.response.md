Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

The problem description requires finding a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`, where `n` is the input positive integer. The fractions in the sequence must have denominators that divide `n`, and the numerators must be less than the denominators.

The program provided only handles the case when `n` is 2 by printing 'NO', which is correct according to the problem description. However, for `n` not equal to 2, it prints 'YES' and then prints two fractions: `1/(n//2)` and `1/n`.

The issue with the program is that it does not guarantee that `n//2` divides `n`, which is a requirement according to the problem description. While `n//2` is an integer division result, ensuring it divides `n` requires `n` to be even. If `n` is odd, `n//2` will not divide `n`.

For example, if `n = 5`, the program will print 'YES', followed by `2`, then `1 2` (for `1/2`), and `1 5` (for `1/5`). However, the sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which does not equal `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Moreover, `n//2 = 2` (integer division), and `2` does not divide `5` exactly, violating another condition of the problem.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, especially for odd numbers where `n//2` does not divide `n`, and it incorrectly calculates the fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`.
