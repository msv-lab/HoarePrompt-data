The code prints '1' and the integer division of `n` by 2 to the console. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed by the code. 'YES' has been printed to the console, and 2 has been printed to the console, and now '1' and `n // 2` have also been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, 2 has been printed to the console, '1' has been printed to the console, and `n // 2` has been printed to the console.**
