Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The program only checks if the input `n` is equal to 2 and returns 'NO' in this case. For other values of `n`, it prints 'YES' and then prints two fractions '1' and 'n // 2' and '1' and 'n'. However, the problem description requires the sequence of fractions to satisfy three conditions: 

1. `b_i` divides `n` for `i = 1... k`
2. `1 < b_i < n` for `i = 1... k`
3. `sum(a_i/b_i) = 1 - 1/n`

The program does not ensure that these conditions are met for every `n`. For example, when `n` is a prime number greater than 2, the only divisors of `n` are 1 and `n`. Therefore, the condition `1 < b_i < n` cannot be satisfied for any `b_i`. However, the program still prints 'YES' and provides a sequence of fractions, which is incorrect.

For instance, if the input is `n = 7`, the program prints 'YES' and then prints '1 3' and '1 7'. However, this sequence does not satisfy the condition `1 < b_i < n` for `b_i = 7`. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
