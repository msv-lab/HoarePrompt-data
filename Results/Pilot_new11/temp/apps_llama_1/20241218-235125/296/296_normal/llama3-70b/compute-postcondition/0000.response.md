The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^9, but this constraint is lost after `n` is reassigned.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
