Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements a solution to the problem described. The function `func_1` checks whether a given number is prime or not, and the main part of the program iterates over values of `m` to find the first case where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The `func_1` function handles all edge cases correctly: numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime, numbers less than or equal to 3 are prime (with 2 and 3 being the only even and the first odd prime, respectively), and for larger numbers, it checks divisibility by 2, 3, and numbers of the form `5 + 6k`, which is an efficient way to check for primality.

The main part of the program iterates over `m` in the range from 1 to 1000, which is sufficient to guarantee finding a counterexample according to the problem statement. For each `m`, it checks if `n*m + 1` is prime using `func_1`. If it finds a non-prime number, it prints the corresponding `m` and stops.

The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. For `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4` is not prime. For `n = 4`, it cannot output `1` because `4*1 + 1 = 5` is prime, but it correctly outputs `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9` is not prime.

Given that the input is guaranteed to be valid (an integer `n` between 1 and 1000 inclusive), the program will always find and print a suitable `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, thus proving PolandBall's hypothesis wrong for any `n`.
