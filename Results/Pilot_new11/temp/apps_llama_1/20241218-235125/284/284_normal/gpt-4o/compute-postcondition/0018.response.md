The code `i += 6` increments the value of `i` by 6. Initially, `i` is 11, so after the code is executed, `i` becomes 11 + 6 = 17.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and the conditions on `x` remain the same. `x` is still an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is not divisible by 5, `x` is not divisible by 7.

The condition regarding the return of False is also based on the original value of `i` (11) and `i + 2` (13), which means if `x` is divisible by 11 or 13, the program returns False. This condition does not change with the new value of `i`, as it specifically refers to the divisibility by the original values of `i` and `i + 2`, not the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is not divisible by 5, `x` is not divisible by 7, `i` is 17, and if `x` is divisible by 11 or 13, the program returns False.

Output State: **`x` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is not divisible by 5, `x` is not divisible by 7, `i` is 17, and if `x` is divisible by 11 or 13, the program returns False**
