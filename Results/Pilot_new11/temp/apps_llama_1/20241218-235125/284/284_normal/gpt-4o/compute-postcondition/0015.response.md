To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i * i <= x`. 

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 11, for the loop to execute again, the condition `i * i <= x` must still be true. 

Since `i` is 11, `i * i` equals 121. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 121.

The other conditions about `x` being an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, not divisible by 5, and not divisible by 7 do not affect the loop's ability to execute one more time directly, as the loop condition only depends on the relationship between `i` and `x`.

Given that `x` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 25, we need to adjust this state to ensure `x` is at least 121 to satisfy the loop condition for another iteration.

State: **`x` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is not divisible by 5, `x` is not divisible by 7, and `i` is 11**
