Given that `num` is either unchanged if it's a prime number and greater than or equal to 2, or the function returns `False` if `num` is not prime, and considering the code `return True`, we can deduce the following:

- The function does not return `False`, which means `num` must be a prime number.
- Since `num` is a prime number and the function returns `True`, it indicates that `num` has passed the primality test without finding any divisors other than 1 and itself.
- The variable `i` would be the last number checked before the function returns `True`, indicating that `i` is the highest divisor checked without finding `num` to be non-prime. For a prime number, this would typically be the square root of `num` or the last number checked in the loop before confirming `num` as prime.

Given this information, when the function returns `True`, it signifies that `num` is indeed a prime number greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **The program returns True, indicating that 'num' is a prime number greater than or equal to 2.**
