To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we must analyze the loop's behavior based on its code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive), checking if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `num` is divisible by any `i` in this range, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number.

From the given output states, we can infer the following:

1. After the loop executes, if it doesn't return `False`, `num` remains unchanged because there are no operations modifying `num` within the loop that don't lead to a return.
2. The variable `i` will be the last number checked in the range if the loop completes without finding a divisor. Since the loop checks up to the square root of `num`, if `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, `i` will be the square root of `num` (if `num` is a perfect square) or the integer part of the square root of `num` plus one, because the loop includes the integer part of the square root of `num` in its range.
3. If `num` is less than or equal to its square root, the loop won't execute or will execute differently because the range will be limited. However, given that `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and the loop starts from 2, the loop will always execute at least once for `num` >= 2, checking divisibility by 2.

Considering the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it returns `False`, the output state after all iterations can be summarized as follows:

- If `num` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`, the function returns `False`, indicating `num` is not prime. This happens before the loop can complete all iterations.
- If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the loop completes without returning `False`, and `num` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state, considering the constraints and the loop's behavior, is focused on whether `num` has been found to be non-prime (which ends the loop prematurely) or if it completes the loop without being divided evenly by any number in the range, which suggests it could be a prime number.

Output State: **`num` is either unchanged if it's a prime number and greater than or equal to 2, or the function returns `False` if `num` is not prime; `i` will be the last number checked before the function potentially returns `False` or completes the loop, indicating the highest divisor checked without finding `num` to be non-prime.**
