Correctness: **True**

The program provided checks if a given number `n·m + 1` is a prime number for a certain `m`. According to the problem description, it needs to find a counterexample for any `n`, which means it should output an `m` such that `n·m + 1` is not a prime number. 

The code defines a helper function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it returns `False`, indicating the number is not prime. If it's not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `True`, indicating the number is prime.

The main part of the code loops through `m` from 1 to 1000, checks if `n·m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function, and if it finds a non-prime `n·m + 1`, it prints the corresponding `m` and breaks the loop.

The code should work correctly for all valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) because it checks all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and uses a correct primality test function. The function `func_1` handles edge cases correctly, including the smallest prime number (2) and the largest possible input (1000). The code also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly: for `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3·1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number, and for `n = 4`, it outputs `2` because `4·1 + 1 = 5` is prime, but `4·2 + 1 = 9`, which is not a prime number. 

Therefore, the code provided correctly implements the required functionality and should work correctly for every potential case.
