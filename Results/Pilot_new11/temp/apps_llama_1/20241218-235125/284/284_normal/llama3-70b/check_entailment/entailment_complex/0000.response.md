Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer input `n` and checks for each `m` in the range of 1 to 1000 if `n*m + 1` is not a prime number. If it finds such an `m`, it prints the value of `m` and stops.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and for composite numbers, and returns `True` for prime numbers. This function is used to check if `n*m + 1` is prime for each `m`.

The program's logic is as follows:

- It iterates through all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
- For each `m`, it calculates `n*m + 1` and checks if this number is prime using the `func_1` function.
- If `n*m + 1` is not prime (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), the program prints the current value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.
- This process ensures that the program finds and prints the smallest `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not prime, as required by the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when `n` is a large number close to 1000. It does not modify the input `n` and only returns the desired output.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
