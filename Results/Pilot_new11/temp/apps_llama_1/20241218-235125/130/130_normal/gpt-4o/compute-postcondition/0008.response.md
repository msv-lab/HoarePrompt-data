The function `func` accepts parameters N, M, K, and L. N, M, K, and L are integers, where N is the total number of different collectible coins, M is the number of friends, K is the number of coins Ivan already has, and L is the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive. The given constraints for the parameters are 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. 

However, since the provided Python function definition `def func():` does not include any parameters, it seems there might be a discrepancy between the problem description and the function definition. 

Given the provided problem description, the correct function definition should include parameters N, M, K, and L. The function should return a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value or calculation is not provided in the problem description.

To describe the functionality based on the given information, we would need the specific output or return values for different cases or conditions of the input parameters N, M, K, and L.

Since the output or return value of the function is not specified, we cannot provide a complete description of the functionality. 

However, assuming the function is supposed to calculate or determine some outcome based on the given parameters and their constraints, the general functionality could be described as:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, M, K, and L, and returns a value based on the total number of different collectible coins, the number of friends, the number of coins Ivan already has, and the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive.**
