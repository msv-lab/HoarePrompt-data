Correctness: **True**

The program always does what the problem description says for every potential case. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires finding the minimum number of coins each friend should gift to Ivan, given that all friends must gift the same number of coins, all coins must be different, and at least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

2. The program calculates `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the condition that at least `L` coins are new in Ivan's collection. This formula works because `M * min_x` will be the total number of coins gifted, and since `min_x` is the smallest integer that satisfies `(L + M - 1) // M`, we are guaranteed to have at least `L` new coins.

3. The program checks if `M * min_x <= N - K`. If this condition is true, it means that there are enough different coins in the universe that are not in Ivan's collection to satisfy the condition. In this case, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend should gift.

4. If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is false, it means that there are not enough different coins in the universe that are not in Ivan's collection to satisfy the condition. In this case, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement.

Therefore, the program always follows the problem description and calculates the correct minimum number of coins each friend should gift to Ivan. It handles all potential cases, including the case where it is impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement.
