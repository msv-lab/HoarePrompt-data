Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to Ivan, satisfying the given conditions. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The program first calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to ensure that Ivan gets at least `L` new coins. This is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`, where `M` is the number of friends. This formula ensures that the total number of new coins is at least `L`.

- Then, the program checks if it's possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins without exceeding the total number of available coins (`N`) minus the coins Ivan already has (`K`). If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, the program prints `min_x`, indicating that it's possible to satisfy the conditions.

- If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, it means that there aren't enough distinct coins available to satisfy the conditions, so the program prints `-1`.

The program handles all the edge cases and potential inputs correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. 

For instance, in the first example with `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`, the program correctly calculates `min_x` as `1` and prints it as the output, since `15 * 1` is less than `20 - 2`.

In the second example with `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`, the program correctly calculates `min_x` as `4` but then prints `-1` as the output, since `11 * 4` is greater than `10 - 2`.

Overall, the program correctly handles all potential cases and examples, and it correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.
