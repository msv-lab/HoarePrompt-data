Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning. The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and after thorough analysis, I agree with this assessment.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan to satisfy the problem conditions. The formula `(L + M - 1) // M` accurately calculates the minimum number of coins `min_x` that each friend must gift such that the total number of new coins is at least `L`. The program then checks if it is possible for each friend to gift `min_x` different coins without exceeding the total number of coins `N` or the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`).

The output hints provide examples of the code's functionality and edge cases, but they do not reveal any flaws in the program's logic. The hints confirm that the program returns the minimum number of rounds `min_x` if Ivan can receive at least `L` new coins without exceeding the available coins, and returns `-1` otherwise.

The original assessment is accurate because it thoroughly examines the program's logic and handles all possible edge cases correctly. The assessment correctly identifies the program's behavior and reasoning, and the output hints do not contradict this assessment.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
