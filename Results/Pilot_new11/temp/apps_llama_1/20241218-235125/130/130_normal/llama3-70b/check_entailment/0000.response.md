Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the number of friends is greater than or equal to the number of new coins Ivan can get and the required number of new coins, and if so, prints 1. However, this does not take into account the fact that each friend must give the same number of coins, and that the total number of given coins must be minimized.

For example, consider the input `N = 10, M = 1, K = 5, L = 2`. The program will print `1`, but this is incorrect because one friend cannot give 1 coin to satisfy the condition that at least 2 new coins are given.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of coins that each friend must give, such that the total number of coins given is minimized and the conditions are satisfied. 

This requires a more complex solution that takes into account the number of new coins Ivan can get, the required number of new coins, and the fact that each friend must give the same number of coins. 

For example, for the input `N = 10, M = 1, K = 5, L = 2`, the correct output should be `-1` because one friend cannot give a number of coins that satisfies the conditions. 

Another example, for the input `N = 10, M = 2, K = 5, L = 3`, the correct output should be `-1` because two friends cannot give the same number of coins that satisfies the conditions. 

However, for the input `N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, L = 3`, the correct output should be `1` because each friend can give 1 coin and the conditions will be satisfied. 

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
