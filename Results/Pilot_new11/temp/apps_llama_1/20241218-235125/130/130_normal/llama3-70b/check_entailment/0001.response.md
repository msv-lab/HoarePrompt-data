Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle all the potential cases correctly. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when N = 5, M = 3, K = 3, L = 2.

In this case, the program will print 1, but the correct answer should be -1. This is because even if each friend gives one coin, the total number of different coins given is 3, but there are only 2 coins that are new in Ivan's collection, which does not meet the requirement of having at least L new coins.

Another issue with the program is that it does not consider the scenario where N is less than M, which means it's impossible for all friends to give different coins. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not handle this situation correctly.

The correct logic should check if the total number of different coins is less than the number of friends or the required number of new coins, and also check if the number of friends times the minimum number of coins per friend is at least the required number of new coins. 

The current program does not consider all these cases, hence it is incorrect.
