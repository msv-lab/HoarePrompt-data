Correctness: **True**.

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem according to the given description and examples. It checks two main conditions: 

1. If the number of friends (M) is greater than or equal to the number of different coins (N) minus the coins Ivan already has (K) plus one. This ensures that it's possible for all friends to give Ivan different coins.

2. If the number of friends (M) is greater than or equal to the minimum number of new coins (L) Ivan should receive.

If both conditions are met, the function prints 1, indicating that it's possible for each friend to give Ivan at least one coin that meets all the conditions. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of its functionality. The code handles all the potential cases as described in the problem, including the examples provided. 

The program assumes that the input will be valid, meaning it does not include error checking for invalid inputs such as negative numbers or invalid ranges for the variables. However, according to the problem statement, we can assume that the input will always be valid, so the lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the program. 

Overall, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the code correctly solves the problem for every potential case.
