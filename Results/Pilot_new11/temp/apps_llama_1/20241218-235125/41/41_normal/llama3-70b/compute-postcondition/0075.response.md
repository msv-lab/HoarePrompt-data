Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False` if there exists a pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`, `i` is 0. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i`.**
