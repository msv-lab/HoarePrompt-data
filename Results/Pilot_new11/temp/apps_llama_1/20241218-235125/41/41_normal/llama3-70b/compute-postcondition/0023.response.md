The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`.**
