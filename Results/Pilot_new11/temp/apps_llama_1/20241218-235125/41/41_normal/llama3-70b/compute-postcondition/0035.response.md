The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the states of `n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `maybe`, `unrated`, and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and the value of `i` depends on the context of an outer loop, if present, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
