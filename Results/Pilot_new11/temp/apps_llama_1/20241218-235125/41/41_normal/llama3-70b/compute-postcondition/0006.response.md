To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`.
- `ratings_after` is an empty list.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.

The given code is:
```python
ratings_after.append(b)
```

This code appends the value of `b` to the `ratings_after` list. 

So, after executing this code:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, so `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000.
- The value of `ratings_before` remains unchanged, so `ratings_before` is still a list containing the input integer `a`.
- The value of `ratings_after` changes, as it now contains the input integer `b`. So, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, so `a` and `b` are still input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
