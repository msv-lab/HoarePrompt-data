According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, and since `j` starts from `i + 1`, now `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and `j` starts from `i + 1` which is 2. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` remains `False`, `unrated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `True`, `i` is 1**
