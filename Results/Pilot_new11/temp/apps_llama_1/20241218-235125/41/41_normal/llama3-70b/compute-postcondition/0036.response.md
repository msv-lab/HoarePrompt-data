Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `unrated` is `False`, then `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `unrated` is `True`, then the execution continues without any changes to `rated`, `maybe`, or the loop/state.**
