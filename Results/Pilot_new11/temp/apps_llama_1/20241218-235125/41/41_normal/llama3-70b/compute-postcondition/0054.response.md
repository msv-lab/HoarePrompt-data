Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If there exists a `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `unrated` is `False`, and for any `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n`, either `ratings_before[i] >= ratings_before[j]` or `ratings_after[i] <= ratings_after[j]`.***
