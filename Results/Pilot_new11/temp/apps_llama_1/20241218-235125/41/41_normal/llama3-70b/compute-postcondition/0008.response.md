The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a` and `b` by taking two space-separated integers as input, converting them to integers using `map(int,...)`, and then unpacking them into `a` and `b`. 

The initial state contains `n` as an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` as a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` as a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. 

After the code is executed, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two input integers. The lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` will now contain the new values of `a` and `b` respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the updated input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
