According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, this condition is met. The loop variable `i` will start at 1. The states of `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but their initial states should be acknowledged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `i` is 1**
