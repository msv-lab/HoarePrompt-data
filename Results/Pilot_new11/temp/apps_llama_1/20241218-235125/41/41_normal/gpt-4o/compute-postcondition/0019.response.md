Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing all its original tuples plus the newly appended tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`; otherwise, the state of `is_rated` remains unchanged as previously determined by the comparison of `a` and `b`.***
