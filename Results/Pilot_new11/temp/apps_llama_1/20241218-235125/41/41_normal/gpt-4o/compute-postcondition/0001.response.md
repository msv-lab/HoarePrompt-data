The code initializes an empty list `ratings`. The initial state provides that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive. This state does not change with the execution of the given code, as the code only introduces a new variable `ratings` without modifying the existing variable `n`. 

Therefore, after executing the code, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and `ratings` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is an empty list**
