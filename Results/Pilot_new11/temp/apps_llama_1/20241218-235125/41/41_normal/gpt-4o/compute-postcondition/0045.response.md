Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers. If `is_rated` is `True`, then `is_unrated` is `False` and 'rated' has been printed. If `is_rated` is `False`, then `is_unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed if there exists at least one pair of consecutive tuples in `ratings` where the first element of the first tuple is less than the first element of the second tuple; otherwise, `is_unrated` is `False` and 'maybe' has been printed.***
