Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 1. If the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`, then `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is not less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged as `False` since there is no else part to handle this condition.***
