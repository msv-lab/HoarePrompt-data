Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and if the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes are made since there is no else part.**
