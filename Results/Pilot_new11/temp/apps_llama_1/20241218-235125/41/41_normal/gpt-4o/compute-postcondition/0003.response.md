The code introduces a new variable `is_unrated` and assigns it the value `False`. The previous variables `n`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` are not affected by this code. 

So, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` remains an empty list, `is_rated` remains `False`, and `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`**
