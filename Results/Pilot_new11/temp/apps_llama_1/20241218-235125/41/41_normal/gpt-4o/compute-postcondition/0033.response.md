The code snippet is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

The initial values of `n`, `ratings`, `i`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` are not affected by the break statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 3, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 3, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
