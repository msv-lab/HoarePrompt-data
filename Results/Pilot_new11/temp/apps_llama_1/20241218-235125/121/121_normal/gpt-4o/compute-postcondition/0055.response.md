Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the count of at least one character is incremented if it was less than `target_count` and `result[i]` is '?', otherwise `counts` remains the same, `result` is a list with its first element set to the first character in `s` that has a count less than `target_count` if `result[i]` is '?', and `i` is 0***
