Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `s` is a string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where at least one key must have a count less than or equal to `target_count`, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result` is a list of characters in `s` with the first element equal to `char`, and `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables***
