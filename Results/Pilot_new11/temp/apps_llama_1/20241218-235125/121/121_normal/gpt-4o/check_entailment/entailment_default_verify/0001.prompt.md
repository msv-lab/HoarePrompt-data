You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It first checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints '===' and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It then initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the genome string `s`.

3. It iterates over the genome string `s` and updates the counts of each nucleotide in the `counts` dictionary.

4. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If so, it prints '===' and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

5. It creates a list `result` from the genome string `s` and iterates over it. For each '?' character found, it replaces it with the first nucleotide 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' that has a count less than the target count.

6. Finally, it prints the decoded genome string.

The program handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem description correctly. It correctly identifies when it's impossible to decode the genome and prints '===' in such cases. 

For example, when the input is "4" and "AA??", the program correctly prints "===" because it's impossible to decode the genome in this case. Similarly, when the input is "6" and "????G?", the program correctly prints "===".

The program also correctly decodes the genome when possible, as shown in the examples "8" and "AG?C??CT", and "4" and "AGCT". 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and each character in `s` can be one of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or an unrecognized nucleotide '?'. It checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' are evenly distributed. If `n` is not divisible by 4, or if any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces allOccurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`, and then prints the modified string. The function does not return any explicit value in the case where it successfully processes the input string. Additionally, if the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will also replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each. The function's behavior implies that it assumes the input will always be provided in the standard format of two lines: the first line containing the integer `n`, and the second line containing the string `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
