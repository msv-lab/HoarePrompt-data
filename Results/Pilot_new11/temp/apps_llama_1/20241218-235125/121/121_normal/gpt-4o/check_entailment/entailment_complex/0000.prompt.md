You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and the number of each of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' plus the number of unrecognized nucleotides '?' can be divided evenly by 4.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, and `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, i.e., `n % 4 == 0`.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value for each key is the count of the respective character in `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a string, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' containing the respective character counts in `s`, and if the program hasn't returned, all character counts in `s` are less than or equal to `target_count`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is the updated count after the loop execution, and `result` is a list of characters where each index is either the original character from `s` or an updated character from the `counts` dictionary.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and each character in `s` can be one of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or an unrecognized nucleotide '?'. It checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' are evenly distributed. If `n` is not divisible by 4, or if any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces allOccurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`, and then prints the modified string. The function does not return any explicit value in the case where it successfully processes the input string. Additionally, if the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will also replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each. The function's behavior implies that it assumes the input will always be provided in the standard format of two lines: the first line containing the integer `n`, and the second line containing the string `s`.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
