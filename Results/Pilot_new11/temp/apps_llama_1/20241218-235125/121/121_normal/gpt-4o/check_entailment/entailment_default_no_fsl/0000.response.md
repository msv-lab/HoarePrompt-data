Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a solution to the genome decoding problem. It takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input, where `s` is a coded genome containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The program checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and if the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' do not exceed `n // 4`. If these conditions are met, it replaces all occurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type that has a count less than `n // 4` and then prints the modified string.

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem description, including:

* If the length `n` is not divisible by 4, it prints '==='.
* If any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '==='.
* If the input string contains only '?' characters and their count is evenly divisible by 4, it replaces them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each.
* If the input string is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it, it prints the same string.

The program also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description, including:

* Input: `8`, `AG?C??CT`, Output: `AGACGTCT`
* Input: `4`, `AGCT`, Output: `AGCT`
* Input: `6`, `????G?`, Output: `===`
* Input: `4`, `AA??`, Output: `===`

The program's logic is correct and it handles all the potential cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
