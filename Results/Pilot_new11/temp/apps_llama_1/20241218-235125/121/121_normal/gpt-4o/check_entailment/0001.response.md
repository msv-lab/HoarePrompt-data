Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It first checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints '===' and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It then initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the genome string `s`.

3. It iterates over the genome string `s` and updates the counts of each nucleotide in the `counts` dictionary.

4. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If so, it prints '===' and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

5. It creates a list `result` from the genome string `s` and iterates over it. For each '?' character found, it replaces it with the first nucleotide 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' that has a count less than the target count.

6. Finally, it prints the decoded genome string.

The program handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem description correctly. It correctly identifies when it's impossible to decode the genome and prints '===' in such cases. 

For example, when the input is "4" and "AA??", the program correctly prints "===" because it's impossible to decode the genome in this case. Similarly, when the input is "6" and "????G?", the program correctly prints "===".

The program also correctly decodes the genome when possible, as shown in the examples "8" and "AG?C??CT", and "4" and "AGCT". 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
