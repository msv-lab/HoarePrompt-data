Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value for each key is the count of the respective character in `s`, and `char` will be one of the keys in `counts` during each iteration. The count of `char` in `s` is less than or equal to `target_count`.**
