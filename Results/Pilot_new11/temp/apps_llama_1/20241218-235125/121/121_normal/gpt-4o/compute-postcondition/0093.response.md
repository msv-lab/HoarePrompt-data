Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is either the original count or the original count plus the number of times the loop updated `result` with that character if the corresponding index in `result` was '?', otherwise `counts` remains the same, and `result` is a list where each index `i` is either '?' or a character from `s` that was updated by the loop, depending on whether the loop executed at least once and updated `result` at that index, and `i` is the index of the last updated element in `result` plus 1***
