Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then the value of `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result` is a list with its first element '?' and its second element 'A', and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `counts`, `result`, or `i`.***
