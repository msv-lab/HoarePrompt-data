Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is adjusted based on replacements made for '?', `c` is the last character in `s`, and `res` contains the modified string from `s` with '?' replaced based on availability in `count` and 'ACGT'. If any value in `count` is greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. If all values in `count` are 0, the value of `res` has been printed.***
