The value of `s` is updated to be the input string. The previous value of `s` was a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' such that the total count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` plus the count of '?' in `s` equals the previous value of `n`. However, this information about the previous `s` is no longer relevant because `s` is reassigned.

The new `s` can be any string (not necessarily of length `n`, and not necessarily consisting only of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'), because `input()` accepts any string. The value of `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
