The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The states of the variables `n`, `s`, `avg`, `nc`, `res`, and `count['C']` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'C', `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'C', `count['C']` is the previous value of `count['C']` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
