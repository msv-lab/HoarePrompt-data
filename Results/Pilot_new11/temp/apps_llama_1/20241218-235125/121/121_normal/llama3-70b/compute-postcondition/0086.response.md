Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4. If `c` is '?', then `nc` is 'T' and `res` is the initial value of `res` plus the first character in 'ACGT' that has a count greater than 0, or the initial value of `res` if no character in 'ACGT' has a count greater than 0. Otherwise, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus `c`.***
