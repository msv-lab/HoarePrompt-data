The function takes an integer `n` between 4 and 255, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' as input. It calculates the count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and then adjusts these counts to achieve a balanced distribution where each character's count is as close as possible to `n // 4`. If there are '?' characters in `s`, it replaces them with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' based on which character's count is currently below its target distribution. The function then checks if all '?' characters have been replaced such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are as close as possible to `n // 4`. If the counts are successfully balanced, the function prints the modified string `s` with all '?' replaced; otherwise, it prints '===' to indicate that not all '?' characters could be replaced to meet the target distribution.
