Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element in `a`, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and `px` equals `nx` and `py` equals `ny`. If the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
