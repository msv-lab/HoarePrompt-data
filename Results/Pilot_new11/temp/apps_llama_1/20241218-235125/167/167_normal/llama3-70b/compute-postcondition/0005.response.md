Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` equals 1**
