Functionality: **This function converts a number represented as a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It accepts two parameters: a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, where `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and all elements of `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1. The function returns the decimal value of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. If the list `digits` is empty, the function returns 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the conversion of numbers with leading zeros and the handling of empty input lists. It does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that the inputs are valid. The final state of the program is that it returns the decimal equivalent of the input number, leaving the input parameters unchanged.**
