You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output
=

Input
3 3
1 0 2

Input
7 16
15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    return decimal_value


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It reads the input for two numbers in different bases, converts them to decimal, and compares their values. The conversion to decimal is done using the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a number in a given base by iterating over its digits and applying the formula for the place value of each digit.

To verify its correctness, let's break down the key steps and compare them against the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for each number, followed by the digits themselves. This matches the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` accurately converts a number from any given base to decimal. It does this by iterating through each digit from left to right (most significant to least significant), multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and then adding the value of the current digit. This process is mathematically sound for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares their values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number, respectively. This comparison logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

The examples provided in the problem description have been considered, and the program seems to handle them correctly:

- For the first example, both numbers are correctly converted to decimal (47 in base 10), and since they are equal, the program outputs '='.
- For the second example, the conversions to base 5 are implicitly considered (X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3), and the comparison shows that X < Y, resulting in the output '<'.
- For the third example, the base 16 and base 9 numbers are converted to decimal, and X is greater than Y, resulting in the output '>'.

Given the logic implemented in the program and its alignment with the problem's requirements, as well as the handling of the provided examples, it seems that the program functions as intended and is correct for all potential cases described in the problem. If a case exists where the program does not work as expected, it was not identified based on the provided description and examples.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40 and all elements of digits are integers between 0 and base - 1.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `digits` is a list of integers.
    #   - `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40.
    #   - All elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1.
    #   - `decimal_value` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for digit in digits:
    #       decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Output States after a few iterations**:
    #   - After 1 iteration: `decimal_value` equals the first digit in `digits`.
    #   - After 2 iterations: `decimal_value` equals the first digit multiplied by `base` plus the second digit.
    #   - After 3 iterations: `decimal_value` equals `(digits[0] * base + digits[1]) * base + digits[2]`, which can be generalized to a polynomial expression representing the conversion of a number from base `base` to decimal.
    #
    #Given the pattern observed from the output states after a few iterations, we can infer that `decimal_value` is calculated by converting the number represented by the list `digits` from base `base` to decimal. The formula for converting a number from any base to decimal is the sum of each digit times the base raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0.
    #
    #Thus, if `digits` has `n` elements, the decimal value can be calculated as:
    #```
    #decimal_value = digits[n-1] + digits[n-2]*base + digits[n-3]*base^2 +... + digits[0]*base^(n-1)
    #```
    #Or more concisely using sigma notation:
    #```
    #decimal_value = Σ digits[i]*base^(n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1
    #```
    #
    #If the list `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `decimal_value` will remain 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`decimal_value` is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, `digits` is a list of integers where all elements are between 0 and `base` - 1.**
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `digits` is a list of integers with all elements between 0 and `base` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function converts a number represented as a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It accepts two parameters: a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, where `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and all elements of `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1. The function returns the decimal value of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. If the list `digits` is empty, the function returns 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the conversion of numbers with leading zeros and the handling of empty input lists. It does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that the inputs are valid. The final state of the program is that it returns the decimal equivalent of the input number, leaving the input parameters unchanged.
