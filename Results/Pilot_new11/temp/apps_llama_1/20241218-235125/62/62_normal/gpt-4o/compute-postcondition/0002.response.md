`decimal_value` is assigned the value of `decimal_value` times `base` plus `digit`. The initial value of `decimal_value` is 0, so `decimal_value` becomes 0 * `base` + `digit`, which simplifies to `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the first digit in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, `decimal_value` is equal to the first digit in the list, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
