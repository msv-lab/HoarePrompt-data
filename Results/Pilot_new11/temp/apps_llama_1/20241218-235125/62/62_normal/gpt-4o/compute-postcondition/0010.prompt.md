You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40 and all elements of digits are integers between 0 and base - 1.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `digits` is a list of integers.
    #   - `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40.
    #   - All elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1.
    #   - `decimal_value` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for digit in digits:
    #       decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Output States after a few iterations**:
    #   - After 1 iteration: `decimal_value` equals the first digit in `digits`.
    #   - After 2 iterations: `decimal_value` equals the first digit multiplied by `base` plus the second digit.
    #   - After 3 iterations: `decimal_value` equals `(digits[0] * base + digits[1]) * base + digits[2]`, which can be generalized to a polynomial expression representing the conversion of a number from base `base` to decimal.
    #
    #Given the pattern observed from the output states after a few iterations, we can infer that `decimal_value` is calculated by converting the number represented by the list `digits` from base `base` to decimal. The formula for converting a number from any base to decimal is the sum of each digit times the base raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0.
    #
    #Thus, if `digits` has `n` elements, the decimal value can be calculated as:
    #```
    #decimal_value = digits[n-1] + digits[n-2]*base + digits[n-3]*base^2 +... + digits[0]*base^(n-1)
    #```
    #Or more concisely using sigma notation:
    #```
    #decimal_value = Σ digits[i]*base^(n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1
    #```
    #
    #If the list `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `decimal_value` will remain 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`decimal_value` is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, `digits` is a list of integers where all elements are between 0 and `base` - 1.**
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `digits` is a list of integers with all elements between 0 and `base` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `digits` is a list of integers with all elements between 0 and `base` - 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
