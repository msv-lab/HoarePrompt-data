The variable `decimal_value` is initialized to 0. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, and `decimal_value` is 0.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, and `decimal_value` is 0**
