Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. It takes the base and digits of two numbers as input, converts them to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values to determine the relationship between the two numbers.

The `func_1` function correctly converts the digits from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal by multiplying each digit by the base raised to the power of its position (from right to left, starting at 0) and summing the results.

The code also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For example, in the first sample, the code correctly converts `101111_2` to `47_10` and `47_{10}` to `47_10`, and then prints "=" because the two numbers are equal.

The output hints provided agree with the code and do not reveal any edge cases that the code does not handle correctly. The code assumes well-formed inputs, which is allowed according to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the code, output hints, and problem description, it appears that the code accurately solves the problem and handles all potential cases correctly.
