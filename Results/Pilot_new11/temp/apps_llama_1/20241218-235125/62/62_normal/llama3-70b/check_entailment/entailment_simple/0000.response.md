Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes the correct input: It reads the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` for the number `X`, followed by the digits of `X`. Then, it reads the number of digits `m` and the base `by` for the number `Y`, followed by the digits of `Y`. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. The program correctly converts the input digits to decimal: The `func_1` function takes a list of digits and a base as input and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by those digits in that base. This is done by iterating over the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant) and multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. This is the correct way to convert a number from any base to decimal.

3. The program correctly compares the two numbers: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them using simple conditional statements. If `X` is less than `Y`, it prints `<`. If `X` is greater than `Y`, it prints `>`. If `X` is equal to `Y`, it prints `=`. This matches the output format specified in the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, assuming the input is valid as stated in the problem description. It correctly converts numbers from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal and compares them, which is the main requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
