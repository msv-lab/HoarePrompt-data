Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. The key to the solution is the `func_1` function, which converts a number from any base to base 10 (decimal system). This is done by iterating over the digits of the number from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the number of digits and the base of the first number (`n` and `bx`) and the digits of the first number (`x_digits`).
2. It reads the number of digits and the base of the second number (`m` and `by`) and the digits of the second number (`y_digits`).
3. It converts both numbers to base 10 using the `func_1` function.
4. It compares the two numbers in base 10 and prints the result.

The `func_1` function is correct because it uses the standard formula for converting a number from any base to base 10:

`result = result * base + digit`

This formula works because it takes into account the place value of each digit in the number.

The program handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For example, in the first sample, `X = 101111_2 = 47_10` and `Y = 47_10`, so the program correctly prints `=`.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the two numbers have different numbers of digits, the program will still compare them correctly.

Overall, the program is correct because it uses a simple and well-established algorithm for converting numbers from any base to base 10, and it handles all the examples and edge cases provided in the problem description correctly.
