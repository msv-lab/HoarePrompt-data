The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers, and `base` is an integer. The constraints on these parameters are such that `base` must be between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and all elements in the `digits` list must be between 0 and `base - 1`. 

The function returns the polynomial evaluation of the list `digits` in base `base`. This means it calculates a value based on the digits provided, considering their positional value in the given base.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, where `base` is between 2 and 40 and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base - 1`, and return the polynomial evaluation of `digits` in base `base`.
