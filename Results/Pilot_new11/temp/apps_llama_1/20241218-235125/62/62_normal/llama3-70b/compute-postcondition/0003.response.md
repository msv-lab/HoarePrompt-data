According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 digits, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is equal to the value of `digit`, `digit` is the first digit in the list. For the loop to execute again, `digits` must have at least 2 digits, `digit` must be the second digit in the list.
State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is equal to the value of the second `digit`, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
