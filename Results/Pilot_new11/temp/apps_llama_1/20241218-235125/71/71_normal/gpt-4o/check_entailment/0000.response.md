Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the number `n` has less than `k` digits and is not divisible by `10^k`. For example, when `n = 123` and `k = 3`, the program will output `len(n) - 1`, which is `2`, but the correct output should be `3` because we need to remove all digits to get a number divisible by `1000`.

Another issue is that the program does not consider cases where removing leading digits would result in a smaller number of removed digits. For example, when `n = 123000` and `k = 3`, the program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `3` because we can remove the leading `123` to get `000`, which is divisible by `1000`.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `n` starts with zeros, although the problem statement guarantees that the input numbers are written in traditional notation of integers, without any extra leading zeros.

To solve this problem correctly, we need a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible substrings of `n` and checks if they are divisible by `10^k` after removing some digits. 

However, this solution should be revised to consider these cases and provide the correct output. 

Here is a simple step-by-step process to solve the problem:

1. Convert the input number `n` to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2. Use a loop to generate all possible substrings of `n`.
3. For each substring, use another loop to generate all possible combinations of digits that can be removed from the substring.
4. Check if the resulting number after removing the digits is divisible by `10^k`. If it is, update the minimum number of digits to be removed.
5. Output the minimum number of digits to be removed.

The correct solution should use a more efficient algorithm to avoid unnecessary iterations and optimize the solution. 

The existing code has several logical and technical errors that make it incorrect. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all possible inputs.
