To determine the output state, we must consider the effects of the given code snippet on the variables `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove`.

Given that `to_remove` is updated by the code `to_remove += 1`, this means `to_remove` will increase by 1 from its previous value.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, and `count_zeros`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.

The initial state specifies:
- `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.
- `k` remains an integer.
- `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are updated based on the next digit in reverse order of `n`, but the specific update for `count_zeros` is not affected by the given code snippet.

After executing `to_remove += 1`, we know that `to_remove` has increased by 1, but we do not have specific values for `n`, `k`, or `count_zeros` to update directly.

Thus, considering all the initial conditions and the effect of the code, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.
- `k` remains an integer.
- `count_zeros` is as updated based on the next digit in reverse order of `n` (no direct change from the given code).
- `to_remove` is increased by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` remains an integer, `count_zeros` is as updated based on the next digit in reverse order of `n`, `to_remove` is the previous value of `to_remove` plus 1**
