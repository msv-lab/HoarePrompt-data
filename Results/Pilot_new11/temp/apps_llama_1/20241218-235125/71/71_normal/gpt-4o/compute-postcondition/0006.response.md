The code increments the `count_zeros` by 1. The initial value of `count_zeros` is 0. 
The value of `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `to_remove` is 0, and `digit` is '0'. 
After incrementing `count_zeros` by 1, `count_zeros` becomes 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, `digit` is '0'**
