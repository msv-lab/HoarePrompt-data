Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not consider the case where the leading digits of the number can be removed to obtain a number that is divisible by 10^k. 

For example, if the input is 10203049 and k = 2, the program should output 3, but it only checks the trailing zeros and non-zero digits, it does not consider removing the leading digits "10203" to obtain "049" and further remove the digits "4" to get "09" and then remove the digit "9" to get "0" which is divisible by 10^2, it could remove 3 digits to get 0 which is divisible by 10^2.

In addition, the current implementation does not consider cases where it might be more optimal to remove leading digits instead of only trailing digits.

The program description requires the minimum number of digits to be deleted, but the program does not guarantee that it finds the minimum number of digits to be deleted in all cases. 

To solve this problem, we need to use dynamic programming or another approach that considers all possible digits removals. 

A correct solution should find the minimum number of digits to be deleted to obtain a number that is divisible by 10^k, considering all possible removals of digits, not just the trailing ones.
