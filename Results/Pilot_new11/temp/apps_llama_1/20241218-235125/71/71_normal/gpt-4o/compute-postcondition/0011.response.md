The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or conditional statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer. The last character of `n` (i.e., `digit`) is either '0' or not '0'. If the last character of `n` is '0', then the current value of `count_zeros` is 1 and the current value of `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, the current value of `count_zeros` is 0 and the current value of `to_remove` is 1. The current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
