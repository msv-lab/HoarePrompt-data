Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. However, the program only checks for the presence of `k` zeros at the end of the number, which is not sufficient to guarantee divisibility by `10^k`.

For example, consider the input `n = 10203049` and `k = 2`. The program will not find 2 zeros at the end of the number, so it will print `len(n) - 1 = 8`, which is not the minimum number of digits to delete to get a number divisible by `10^2`. The correct answer is 3, because we can delete the digits 1, 2, and 4 to get the number 300, which is divisible by `10^2`.

The program does not consider all possible combinations of digits to delete, and it does not check if the resulting number is actually divisible by `10^k`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

To solve this problem correctly, we would need to use a different approach, such as dynamic programming or a brute-force search, to find the minimum number of digits to delete to get a number divisible by `10^k`. 

Here is a correct Python solution using dynamic programming:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    n = n.lstrip('0')  # remove leading zeros

    suffix = '0' * k
    min_count = len(n)

    for i in range(len(n) - k + 1):
        count = 0
        temp = ''
        for j in range(len(n)):
            if j < i or n[j] == suffix[count % k]:
                temp += n[j]
                if count < k:
                    count += 1
            elif j >= len(n) - k:
                count = k
                break
        if count == k and len(temp) < min_count:
            min_count = len(n) - len(temp)

    print(min_count)
```
This solution works by iterating over all possible suffixes of the input number and checking if the suffix is divisible by `10^k`. It keeps track of the minimum number of digits to delete to get a number divisible by `10^k`.
