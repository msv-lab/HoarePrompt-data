To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `n % 10 ** k!= 0`. This condition checks if `n` is not divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`, meaning the last `k` digits of `n` should not all be zeros for the loop to continue.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is the input integer with its last two digits removed.
- `w` is increased by 1.

The loop's continuation depends solely on the value of `n` and the condition `n % 10 ** k!= 0`. Since `n` has its last two digits removed, it implies that the last two digits of the original number are not considered in `n`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` still does not end in `k` zeros.

However, we don't have explicit information about the value of `k`. If `k` is 2 or less, removing the last two digits of the input integer would ensure that `n` does not end in `k` zeros if the original number did not end in more than two zeros (considering `k=2`), or it would not affect the condition for `k<2`. But if `k` is greater than 2, the condition could still be met depending on the original digits of `n` before the last two were removed.

Since `w` is increased by 1, and there's no direct relation given between `w` and the loop condition, `w` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute again based on the provided information.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we must consider the condition `n % 10 ** k!= 0`. Given `n` already has its last two digits removed, we should focus on the condition that allows `n` to still fulfill the loop's requirement. Without explicit information on `k`, the critical factor is that `n`, as modified (with its last two digits removed), should be such that it doesn't become divisible by `10 ** k` after the removal.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `n`, after having its last two digits removed, must still meet the loop's condition, implying that the removal of the last two digits does not make `n` divisible by `10 ** k`, which is already considered in the description of `n`. The value of `w` increasing by 1 is noted but does not directly impact the loop's condition.

State: **`n` is the input integer with its last two digits removed and does not become divisible by `10 ** k` after this removal, `w` is increased by 1**
