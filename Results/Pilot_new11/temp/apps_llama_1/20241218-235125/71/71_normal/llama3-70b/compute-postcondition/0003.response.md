The value of `w` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `w` is unknown, and the value of `n` is an input integer not divisible by 10, which is not affected by the code. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer not divisible by 10, and `w` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer not divisible by 10, and `w` is increased by 1**
