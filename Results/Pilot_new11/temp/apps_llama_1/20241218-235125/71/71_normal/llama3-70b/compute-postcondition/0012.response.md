The code `print(w)` simply prints the value of `w` to the console. It does not modify any variables or change the state of the program in any way. 

The initial state mentions `n`, but the code snippet provided does not modify or use `n`. Therefore, the state of `n` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is either 0 or the original value of `n` with its last `k` digits removed if it was divisible by 10, and the value of `w` has been printed.**
