Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue is that the program always removes the last digit of the number `n` until it finds a number that is divisible by `10**k`. However, this approach may not be optimal. 

A counterexample is when `n = 10203049` and `k = 2`. The program will remove the last digits one by one until it finds a number that is divisible by `10**2`, but this will result in removing more digits than necessary. A better approach would be to try removing each digit and check if the resulting number is divisible by `10**k`, and keep track of the minimum number of digits removed.

The given program does not handle this case correctly and does not provide the optimal solution for this problem. It only checks the number by removing the last digits which is not correct as per the problem statement. 

The correct approach should be to generate all possible sub-strings of the input number and then check each sub-string if it is divisible by `10**k`. The minimum number of digits removed to get a divisible number should be the answer. 

So, the given program is not correct for every potential case.
