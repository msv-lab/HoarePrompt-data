The code `n //= 10` removes the last digit of `n` by performing integer division of `n` by 10.

Given that `n` is the input integer with its last digit removed and initially had enough digits to not be divisible by 10, and `w` is increased by 1.

Since `n` had its last digit removed, let's denote the original input integer as `x`. Then `n` would be `x // 10`. After executing `n //= 10`, `n` becomes `x // 100`.

The value of `w` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer with its last two digits removed, `w` is increased by 1**
