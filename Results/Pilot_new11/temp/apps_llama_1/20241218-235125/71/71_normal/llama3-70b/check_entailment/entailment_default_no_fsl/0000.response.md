Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the while loop condition and the way it modifies the input variable `n`. The loop condition `n % 10 ** k!= 0` is checking if `n` is divisible by `10 ** k` and if not, it removes the last digit by performing integer division by 10. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of digits to be removed to make `n` divisible by `10 ** k`.

A counterexample is when `n = 100` and `k = 9`. The code will return `2` because it removes the last two digits (00) to make `n` equal to `1`, which is not divisible by `10 ** 9`. However, the correct answer is `2` because removing the last two digits (00) results in `1`, and then removing the remaining digit `1` would result in `0`, which is divisible by `10 ** 9`. But a better approach would be to remove the digits `1` and any of the `0`s, resulting in `0`, which requires only `2` removals.

In this case, the code does not work correctly because it always removes digits from the right, whereas the problem statement allows removing any digits. Therefore, the code needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of removing digits to find the minimum number of removals required.

Here's an example of a correct approach:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    n_str = str(n)
    min_removals = float('inf')

    for i in range(2 ** len(n_str)):
        mask = bin(i)[2:].zfill(len(n_str))
        temp_str = ''
        for j in range(len(n_str)):
            if mask[j] == '1':
                temp_str += n_str[j]
        if temp_str and int(temp_str) % (10 ** k) == 0 and not (len(temp_str) > 1 and temp_str[0] == '0'):
            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(n_str) - len(temp_str))
        elif temp_str == '0' and (10 ** k) >= 1:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(n_str) - len(temp_str))

    print(min_removals)
```
This code generates all possible combinations of removing digits from the input number `n` and checks if the resulting number is divisible by `10 ** k`. It keeps track of the minimum number of removals required to achieve this. Note that this code has an exponential time complexity due to the generation of all possible combinations, but it guarantees the correct result for all cases.
