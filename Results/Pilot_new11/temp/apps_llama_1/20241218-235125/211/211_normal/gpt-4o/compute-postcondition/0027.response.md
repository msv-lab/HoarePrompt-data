The code prints the value of `i + 2` and `n`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 2` equals 4. The value of `n` is still between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and at least 3, and the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '3' has been printed, and now '4' and the value of `n` have been printed. 

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '3' has been printed, '4' has been printed, and the value of `n` has been printed**
