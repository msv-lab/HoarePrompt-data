Postcondition: **The list `A` is assigned the input list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element. The current value of `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is not equal to 0.**
