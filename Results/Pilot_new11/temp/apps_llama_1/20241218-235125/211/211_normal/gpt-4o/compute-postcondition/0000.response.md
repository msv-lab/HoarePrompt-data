The input is a list of integers where the first element represents the number of elements in the array A, and the remaining elements represent the array A itself. The code provided is `n = int(input())`. 

Here, `n` is assigned the value of the first element of the input list, which is the number of elements in the array A.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: The input list has at least one element, the first element of the list is an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for the remaining elements in the list.
Output State: **The input list has at least one element, the first element of the list is an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for the remaining elements in the list.**
