Postcondition: **The list `A` is assigned the input list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, and the string '1' along with the value of `n` which is `A[0]` has been printed. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, no additional actions have been taken beyond the initial state described in the precondition.**
