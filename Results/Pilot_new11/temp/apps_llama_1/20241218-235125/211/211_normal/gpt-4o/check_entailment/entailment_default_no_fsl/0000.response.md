Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The main issue with the code is that it only checks if the total sum of the array is not zero and prints the entire array as a single subarray, or if the sum is zero, it finds the first non-zero element and attempts to print two subarrays. However, this approach does not guarantee that each subarray has a non-zero sum, which is a key requirement in the problem description.

For example, if the input array is [-1, 1, -1, 1], the sum of the entire array is zero. In this case, the code will find the first non-zero element (which is -1) and print two subarrays: [1, 1] and [2, 4]. However, the sum of the subarray [1, 1] is zero, which does not meet the problem's requirements.

Furthermore, the code does not handle cases where the array needs to be split into more than two subarrays to meet the requirements. For instance, if the input array is [1, -1, 1, -1, 2], the code will not be able to find a correct split.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed that can dynamically split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. The provided code does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases, and therefore, its correctness is False.
