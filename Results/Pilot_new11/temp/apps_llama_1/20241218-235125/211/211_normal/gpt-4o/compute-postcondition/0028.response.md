The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The list `A` still has `A[0]` as an integer `n` with 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) still sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is still 0, `i` is still 2, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '3' has been printed, '4' has been printed, and the value of `n` has been printed. 
Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '3' has been printed, '4' has been printed, the value of `n` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
