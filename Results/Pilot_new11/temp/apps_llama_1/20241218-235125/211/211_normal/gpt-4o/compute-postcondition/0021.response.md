The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed again, '3' has been printed, and the value of `n` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
