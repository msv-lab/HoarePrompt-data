According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is equal to 0, which is the sum of all elements in `A`. This implies that the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) must sum up to `-A[0]`, because `A[0]` is the first element of `A` and is included in the sum.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, because the loop iterates over the range of `n`, starting from 0.

State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1**
