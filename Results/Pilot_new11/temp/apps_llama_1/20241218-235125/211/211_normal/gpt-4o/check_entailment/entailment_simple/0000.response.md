Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

The issue with the given program lies in the way it handles the case when the total sum of the array is 0. According to the problem description, if the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero, and the new arrays placed one after another form the old array A, then the program should print "YES", the number of new arrays, and the subarray indices. However, the given program only checks for non-zero elements and splits the array into two parts based on the first non-zero element it finds, which does not guarantee that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero.

In the case where the total sum of the array is 0, the program should check all possible subarrays to find the ones with non-zero sums. But the given program does not do this correctly. 

For example, consider the input:

```
4
-1 2 -1 0
```

The sum of the array elements is 0. The given program will not handle this case correctly because it will not find two subarrays with non-zero sums. It will simply print "YES", "2", and the subarray indices based on the first non-zero element it finds.

To correctly follow the problem description, the program should find all possible subarrays with non-zero sums and print the subarray indices accordingly. 

Here is an example of a correct Python program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = []
    start = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if sum(A[start:i+1])!= 0:
            result.append((start+1, i+1))
            start = i + 1
    if start!= n:
        if sum(A[start:])!= 0:
            result.append((start+1, n))
        else:
            print("NO")
            return
    if not result:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(result))
        for i in result:
            print(i[0], i[1])

func()
```

This program correctly handles the case where the total sum of the array is 0 by checking all possible subarrays and finding the ones with non-zero sums. It then prints the subarray indices accordingly.
