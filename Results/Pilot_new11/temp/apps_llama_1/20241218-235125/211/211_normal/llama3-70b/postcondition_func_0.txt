The function processes a list of integers, provided through user input, with a length between 1 and 100, and each integer ranging from -10^3 to 10^3. It calculates the prefix sum of the input list and checks if the total sum of the list is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of indices that represent the start and end points of subsequences where the sum of elements is non-zero and not equal to the total sum of the list. The function then prints the count of such subsequences, the start index of the last subsequence, and the total length of the list. The function handles edge cases where the input list has a length of 1, where the total sum is zero, and where there are no subsequences with a non-zero sum that is not equal to the total sum. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly. If the input list is empty (i.e., the user inputs 0), the function will still execute without errors, printing 'NO' because the total sum of an empty list is considered zero. The function assumes that the user will provide valid input and does not perform any error checking.
