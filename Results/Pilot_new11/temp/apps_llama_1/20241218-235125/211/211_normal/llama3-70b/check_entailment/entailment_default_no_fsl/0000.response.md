Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way it prints the number of new arrays and their corresponding start and end indices. According to the problem description, the code should print the number of new arrays (k) on a separate line, followed by the start and end indices of each subarray on new lines. However, the code prints the count of subsequences along with the start and end indices.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```
The code should print:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
However, the code will print something else, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Another issue is that the code does not handle the case when the sum of a subarray is not zero but equals the total sum of the array correctly. In such cases, it should not be included in the list of new arrays.

To fix these issues, the code should be modified to correctly print the number of new arrays and their corresponding start and end indices, and to handle the case when the sum of a subarray equals the total sum of the array. 

Here is an example of a correct code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 0
        result = []
        for r in range(n):
            if prefix_sum[r + 1]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r + 1]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                if l!= r:
                    result.append((l + 1, r + 1))
                    k += 1
                l = r + 1
        if l!= n:
            result.append((l + 1, n))
            k += 1
        print(k)
        for start, end in result:
            print(start, end)
```
