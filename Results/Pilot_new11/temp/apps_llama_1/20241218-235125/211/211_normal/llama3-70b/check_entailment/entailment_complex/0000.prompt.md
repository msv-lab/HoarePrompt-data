You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input array A is a list of integers, with a length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, and `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, or `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is undefined if `n` is 0.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the last `r` where `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]` or 1 if no such `r` exists, `r` is `n`, and 'YES' has been printed.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, or `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is undefined if `n` is 0. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, then 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, and `k`, `l`, `n` have been printed, where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the last `r` where `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]` or 1 if no such `r` exists, and `r` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers, provided through user input, with a length between 1 and 100, and each integer ranging from -10^3 to 10^3. It calculates the prefix sum of the input list and checks if the total sum of the list is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of indices that represent the start and end points of subsequences where the sum of elements is non-zero and not equal to the total sum of the list. The function then prints the count of such subsequences, the start index of the last subsequence, and the total length of the list. The function handles edge cases where the input list has a length of 1, where the total sum is zero, and where there are no subsequences with a non-zero sum that is not equal to the total sum. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly. If the input list is empty (i.e., the user inputs 0), the function will still execute without errors, printing 'NO' because the total sum of an empty list is considered zero. The function assumes that the user will provide valid input and does not perform any error checking.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
