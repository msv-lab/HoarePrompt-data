Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, or `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is undefined if `n` is 0. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, then 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, and `k`, `l`, `n` have been printed, where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the last `r` where `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]` or 1 if no such `r` exists, and `r` is `n`.***
