The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `r`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `r` is 2, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is 2, and `k`, `l`, `r` have been printed where `r` equals 2**
