According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `A`, `a`, `n`, and `prefix_sum` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0 (because the loop starts from 0).

State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0**
