Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The program uses a brute-force approach, iterating over all possible combinations of houses (a) and cars (b) that Kolya could have bought, and for each combination, it calculates the number of computers (c) that would be required to exhaust the remaining coins.

The program checks if the total cost of the bought items (a houses, b cars, and c computers) equals the initial number of game-coins (n). If such a combination is found, the program prints "YES" and exits. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program prints "NO".

This approach is correct because it exhaustively searches all possible integer combinations of houses, cars, and computers that could be bought with the given number of game-coins. The use of integer division (//) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of items, as required by the problem statement.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example (n = 1359257), the program correctly identifies that buying one house, one car, and one computer would exhaust the initial number of game-coins, printing "YES". In the second example (n = 17851817), the program correctly determines that there is no combination of houses, cars, and computers that would exactly exhaust the initial number of game-coins, printing "NO".

Given the program's exhaustive search and correct handling of integer divisions, it should work correctly for all possible inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
