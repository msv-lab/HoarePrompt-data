The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. The relationship between `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` is still maintained as `n = a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`. The string 'YES' has been printed to the console. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `k` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `c` is `k // 1234` and is greater than or equal to 0, `n = a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, the string 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated.**
