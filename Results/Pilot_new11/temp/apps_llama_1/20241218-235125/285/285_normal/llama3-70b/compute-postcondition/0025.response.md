Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234`. If `n` equals `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, then the string 'YES' has been printed and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with `n` greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234`, and `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`.***
