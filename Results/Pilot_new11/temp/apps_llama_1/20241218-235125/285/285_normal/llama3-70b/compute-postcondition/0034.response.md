The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change, and 'YES' has still been printed. The variable `c` is still equal to `(n - 1479479) // 1234`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 1479479) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has exited.**
