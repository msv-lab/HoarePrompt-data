The given code `exit()` will terminate the program's execution immediately. It does not modify any variables but stops the execution of the program. The values of the variables and the prior conditions remain unchanged because `exit()` does not affect variable values; it merely ends the program.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 246912) // 1234`, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1, `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 3, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has been terminated.**
