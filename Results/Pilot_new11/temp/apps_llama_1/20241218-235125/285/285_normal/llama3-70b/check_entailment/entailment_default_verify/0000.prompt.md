You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is designed to determine whether it's possible for Kolya to spend all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates over possible combinations of houses (a), cars (b), and computers (c) that Kolya could buy, checking if the total cost equals his initial n game-coins.

The program's logic is sound because it checks all possible combinations of a, b, and c within reasonable boundaries. The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (a) from 0 to the maximum number of houses Kolya could afford with n game-coins. The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (b) from 0 to the maximum number of cars Kolya could afford with the remaining game-coins after buying a houses. The number of computers (c) is then calculated based on the remaining game-coins after buying a houses and b cars.

If the program finds a combination (a, b, c) such that a × 1,234,567 + b × 123,456 + c × 1,234 equals n, it prints "YES" and exits. If it checks all possible combinations without finding a match, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when n is a multiple of 1,234,567, 123,456, or 1,234, and when n is not a multiple of any of these numbers. It also correctly handles cases where n is 0, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer input from the user, checks if the number can be represented as a sum of multiples of 1234567, 123456, and 1234, and prints 'YES' if such a representation exists, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result to the console. The input integer is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If the input is outside of this range, the function may not behave as expected. The function's execution terminates when it finds a valid representation or exhausts all possible combinations, at which point it prints the result and terminates.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
