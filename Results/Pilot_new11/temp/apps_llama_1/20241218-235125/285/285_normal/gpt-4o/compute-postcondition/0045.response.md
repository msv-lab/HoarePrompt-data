Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2590580`. If `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there are no changes specified in the else part.***
