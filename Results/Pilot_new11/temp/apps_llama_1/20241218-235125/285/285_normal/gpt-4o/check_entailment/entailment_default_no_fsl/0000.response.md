Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the problem description. It checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers within the given budget `n`. The code iterates through the possible number of houses, then for each number of houses, it iterates through the possible number of cars that can be bought with the remaining budget. Finally, it checks if the remaining budget after buying houses and cars can be exactly used to buy computers. If such a combination is found, it returns 'YES', otherwise, it returns 'NO' after exhausting all possibilities.

The given examples (Input: 1359257, Output: YES; Input: 17851817, Output: NO) are correctly handled by the program, and the code's logic aligns with the problem's requirements. The program's assumption that the input will be a positive integer `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and its focus on finding a suitable combination of purchases without considering inputs outside this range or non-integer inputs are in line with the problem statement.

The program's use of nested loops to check combinations and its condition for checking divisibility by the computer's cost ensures that it will find a valid combination if one exists, or correctly conclude that no such combination exists. Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem's requirements and will work as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
