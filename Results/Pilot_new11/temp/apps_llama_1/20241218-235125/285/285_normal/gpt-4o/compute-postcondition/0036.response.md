To calculate the output state, let's first understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
```

Now, calculating the impact of this code on the program state:
- `n` is a positive integer and `n >= 2 * house_cost`. Given `house_cost = 1234567`, `n >= 2 * 1234567`.
- `a * house_cost = 2 * 1234567 = 2469134`.
- Therefore, `remaining_after_houses = n - 2469134`.

The states of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `remaining_after_houses` and its value based on `n` and the calculated value of `a * house_cost`.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * house_cost`, and `2 * house_cost = 2469134`, `remaining_after_houses` will be `n - 2469134`, which means `remaining_after_houses` will be greater than or equal to `0` because `n >= 2469134`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0.**
