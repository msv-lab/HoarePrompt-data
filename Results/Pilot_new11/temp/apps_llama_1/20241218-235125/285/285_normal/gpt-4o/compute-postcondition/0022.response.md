The value of `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus `b` times `car_cost`. Since `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` will be equal to `remaining_after_houses`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

`remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0. 
`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, which is 1234567.
`house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567`**
