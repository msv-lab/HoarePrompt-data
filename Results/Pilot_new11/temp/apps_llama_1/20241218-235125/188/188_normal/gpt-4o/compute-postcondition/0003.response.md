The code assigns `unique_numbers` the value of the sorted keys of the `count` dictionary based on their frequencies in ascending order. 

The state of `n` is not affected, so `n` is still an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive). 

The state of `cards` is also not affected, so `cards` is still a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The state of `count` is not affected, so `count` is still a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, and `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order**
