Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle all cases as described in the problem. For example, it only checks if the two most frequent numbers have a combined total of n/2 cards each. However, it does not consider other possible pairs of numbers that could also satisfy the condition.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: suppose we have a sequence of 6 numbers, where 3 are of one type and 3 are of another type. In this case, the code would not return 'YES' because it only checks the two most frequent numbers. But we could have another pair of numbers, each with a frequency of 3, that would satisfy the condition.

However, another issue is that the code does not consider the condition that the numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya must be distinct. But this condition is handled by the code since it checks the two most frequent numbers and returns 'NO' if there are less than two unique numbers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to check all possible pairs of numbers, not just the two most frequent ones. 

In addition, the program should check all pairs of numbers, not just the most frequent ones, to see if any pair can divide the cards into two equal groups. 

Here is a revised version of the code that checks all pairs of numbers:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        found = False
        for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(unique_numbers)):
                if count[unique_numbers[i]] + count[unique_numbers[j]] == n and count[unique_numbers[i]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[j]] == n // 2:
                    print('YES')
                    print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print('NO')
```
This revised code checks all pairs of numbers to see if any pair can divide the cards into two equal groups. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' and the pair of numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

We should note that this revised code has a time complexity of O(n^2), which could be slow for large inputs. A more efficient solution would involve using a hashmap to store the counts of each number, and then iterating through the hashmap to find pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition. This would have a time complexity of O(n). 

However, since we are assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and the problem description does not specify the size of the input, the revised code should work correctly for the given problem description.
