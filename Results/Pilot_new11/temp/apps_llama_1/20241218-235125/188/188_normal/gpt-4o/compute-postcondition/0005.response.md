To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`.
- `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order, with less than 2 elements.

The code given is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This code simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. It does not modify any variables or data structures.

Given this information, the output state after executing the code is:
- The values of `n`, `cards`, `count`, and `unique_numbers` remain unchanged because the `print` statement does not affect these variables.
- The string 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order with less than 2 elements, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
