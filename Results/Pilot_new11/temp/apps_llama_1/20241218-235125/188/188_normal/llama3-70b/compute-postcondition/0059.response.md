Functionality: **The function accepts an even number `n` as input and then `n` integers between 1 and 100. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and checks if there are exactly two integers that each appear `n/2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but provides output to the console indicating whether the list contains a pair of integers that each account for half of the total list length, considering the input specifications.**
