Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers and must have at least 1 element, the first element in `a` is `i`. Initially, `d` is an empty dictionary, but currently, `d` is a dictionary that contains `i` as one of its keys, meaning the condition of `i` being in `d` is met.**
