Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why:

1. The program first reads the number of cards `n` and then reads the numbers written on each card, storing them in a list `a`.
2. It then creates a dictionary `d` where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`.
3. The program then iterates through the dictionary `d` and checks if there are two integers that have a count of `n // 2`. If such integers are found, they are stored in `a1` and `a2`.
4. Finally, if both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, the program prints 'YES' along with the values of `a1` and `a2`, indicating that a fair game is possible. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program meets the problem description because:

* It correctly identifies the numbers on the cards and their counts.
* It checks for the existence of two integers with a count of `n // 2`, which is a necessary condition for a fair game.
* If such integers are found, the program prints 'YES' and the values of the integers, allowing Petya and Vasya to choose numbers for a fair game.
* If no such integers are found, the program prints 'NO', indicating that a fair game is not possible.

The program assumes that the input will be valid, as stated in the problem description, so it does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., `n` is not an even number, or the numbers on the cards are not between 1 and 100). However, within the scope of the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic to determine whether a fair game is possible.
