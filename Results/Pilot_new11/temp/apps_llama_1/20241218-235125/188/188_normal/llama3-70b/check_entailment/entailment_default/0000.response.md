Correctness: **False**

The code is designed to determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integers before the game so that the game is fair. However, it only checks if there are exactly two integers that each appear `n/2` times in the list. 

A case where the code does not work correctly is when there are more than two integers that each appear a certain number of times, as long as the total number of occurrences of two of these integers adds up to `n`. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], the function should return 'YES' and print two integers, but the current implementation returns 'NO' because it does not find two integers that each appear exactly `n/2` times. 

However, this example is in the problem description and the code is supposed to return 'NO' in this case, because Petya and Vasya can only choose two integers. A correct case where the code does not work is when all numbers appear the same number of times but this number of times is not n/2, the code should return 'NO' but if there is another integer that appears n/2 times the code will return 'YES'. 

Another case where the code does not work correctly is when there is only one integer that appears `n/2` times, and another integer that appears less than `n/2` times but more than 0 times. The code should return 'NO' in this case, but if there are other integers that appear less than `n/2` times, the code will return 'YES' if two of these integers together appear `n` times.

However a more simple example is when there are two integers but one appears more than n/2 times, in this case it is impossible to choose two integers so that the game will be fair, but if there is a third integer that appears n/2 times, then the code will return 'YES', and two integers that each appear n/2 times. 

So the code does not work correctly in all cases. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle these cases correctly. We can do this by checking if there are two integers that each appear a certain number of times such that their total occurrences add up to `n`, and also checking if one of the integers appears more than `n/2` times. 

However the given code actually handles the cases described in the problem description, the problem description only asks us to determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integers before the game so that the game is fair, and this means that we only need to check if there are two integers that each appear `n/2` times. If there are more than two integers that each appear `n/2` times, or there are two integers but one appears more than `n/2` times, we should return 'NO'. 

So the code actually works correctly for the given problem description, the problem description does not ask us to handle the cases where there are more than two integers or one integer appears more than `n/2` times, and it returns 'YES' if and only if there are two integers that each appear `n/2` times, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. 

However this code is still incorrect if the problem description is interpreted in a different way, for example if the game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards and each player gets the same number of cards, but the number of cards that each player gets does not have to be `n/2`. 

Correctness: **True**

This code works correctly for the given problem description. It checks if there are two integers that each appear `n/2` times, and returns 'YES' and prints these two integers if they exist. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. This is the expected behavior according to the problem description. 

Note that the code assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., `n` will be an even number, and the numbers written on the cards will be positive integers. 

The code correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description, including the case where the game is fair and the case where the game is not fair. 

Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
