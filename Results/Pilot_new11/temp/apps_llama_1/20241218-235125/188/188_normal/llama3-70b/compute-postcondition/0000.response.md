The value of `n` is updated to be an input integer. The previous information about `n` being an even number is no longer valid because `n` can now be any integer. The list of integers is still valid but its size is now determined by the new value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) representing the numbers written on the cards.**
