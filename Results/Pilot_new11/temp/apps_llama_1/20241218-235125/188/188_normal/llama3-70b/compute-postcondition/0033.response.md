The code assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. The previous value of `a2` was -1, and the previous value of `i` is the first key in `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is the first key in `d`, `i` is the first key in `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` equals half of the current value of `n`**
