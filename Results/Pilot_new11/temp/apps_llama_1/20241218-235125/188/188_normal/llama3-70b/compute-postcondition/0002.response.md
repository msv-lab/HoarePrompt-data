According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, there is a list of `n` integers, and `a` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
