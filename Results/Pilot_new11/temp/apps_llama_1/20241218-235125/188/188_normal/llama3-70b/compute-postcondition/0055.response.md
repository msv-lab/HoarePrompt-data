Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or the second integer with a count of `n // 2`, and either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1 (or both), meaning that there is not both a first and a second integer that appears exactly `n // 2` times in `a`.**
