To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` input integers with the second element as the new `i`.
- `d` is a dictionary where the previous `i` is a key with its value incremented by 1, and the new `i` is a key with its value either incremented by 1 if it already existed, or equals 1 if it did not exist.

The given code is: `d[i] += 1`.

The impact of the code on the program is that it increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1.

Considering the initial state, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, so `i = a[1]`. The dictionary `d` initially has the previous `i` as a key with its value incremented by 1, and the new `i` (which is `a[1]`) as a key with its value either incremented by 1 if it already existed, or equals 1 if it did not exist.

After executing the code `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d[i]` will be incremented by 1. This means that if `i` (which is `a[1]`) was already a key in `d` with a value, that value will be incremented by 1. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it will be added with a value of 1 (since it's the first time it's encountered as per the initial state description for new `i`), and then this value is immediately incremented by 1 due to the code, resulting in a value of 2 for `d[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` input integers with the second element as the new `i`.
- `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` (where `i` is the second element of `a`, so `i = a[1]`) is incremented by 1 from its previous state.

The specific update to `d[i]` means that if `d[i]` was initially 1 (because `i` was a new key), it becomes 2. If `d[i]` was greater than 1 (because `i` was already a key), its value increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers with the second element as the new `i`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (which is `a[1]`) has its value incremented by 1 from its initial value based on whether `i` was a new or existing key.**
