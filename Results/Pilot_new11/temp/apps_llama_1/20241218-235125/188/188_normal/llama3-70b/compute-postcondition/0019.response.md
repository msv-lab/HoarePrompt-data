Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers with the second element as the new `i`. `d` is a dictionary where the previous `i` has its value incremented by 1, and for the new `i` (which is `a[1]`), if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `d[i]` equals 1, indicating that this is the first occurrence of `i`.***
