To determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of the given Python code snippet on the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- There is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
a.append(int(input()))
```
This line of code does the following:
- It accepts an input from the user, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and then appends this integer to the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the effect of the code, the output state is as follows:
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, as it is not modified by the code.
- The list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 is unaffected by the code snippet.
- `a`, initially an empty list, now contains one integer element that was input by the user and converted to an integer. This integer can be any value, depending on the user's input, but for the sake of the current execution, let's denote it as the input integer.
- `i` remains 0, as the code does not modify its value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` contains one integer element which is the input integer, `i` is 0**
