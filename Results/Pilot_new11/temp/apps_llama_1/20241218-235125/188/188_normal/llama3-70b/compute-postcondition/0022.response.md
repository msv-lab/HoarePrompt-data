The given code sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. This means that the value of `d[i]` is no longer dependent on whether `a[2]` was a key in `d` or not. 

`d[i]` is now 1. 

Other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `i` is the third element of `a` (`a[2]`), and `d[i]` equals 1**
