According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, and the list must have at least 3 integers, `a` still contains two integer elements.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` contains two integer elements which are input integers, `i` is 2**
