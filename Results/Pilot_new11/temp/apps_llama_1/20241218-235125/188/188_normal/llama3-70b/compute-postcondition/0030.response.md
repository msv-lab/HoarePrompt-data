The code assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. The value of `i` is the first key in `d`, but the specific value of `i` is not provided. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a` is still a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary with the same key-value pairs, `c` is still 0, `a2` is still -1, and `i` is still the first key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is the first key in `d` (`i`), `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`, and `d[i]` equals half of the current value of `n`.**
