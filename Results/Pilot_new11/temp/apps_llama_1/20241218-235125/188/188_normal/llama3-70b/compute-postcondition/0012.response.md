The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `d` is a dictionary that contains `i` as one of its keys, and the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer, `a` is still a list of `n` input integers with `i` as its first element, and `d` is still a dictionary that contains `i` as one of its keys.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers with `i` as its first element, `d` is a dictionary that contains `i` as one of its keys and `d[i]` is the initial value of `d[i]` plus 1**
