Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' has been printed. If the sum of `x` is equal to the sum of `y`, then `x` and `y` are sorted lists and either 'Yes' has been printed if `x` is equal to `y`, or 'No' has been printed if `x` is not equal to `y`.***
