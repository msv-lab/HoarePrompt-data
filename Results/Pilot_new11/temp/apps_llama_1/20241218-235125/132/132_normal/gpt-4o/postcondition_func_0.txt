The function determines whether the sum of elements in list `y` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in list `x` for two input lists `x` and `y` of the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and each element in both lists is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive). It accepts no parameters but instead reads `n`, `x`, and `y` directly from the input. The function then prints 'Yes' if the sum of `y` is less than or equal to the sum of `x`, and 'No' otherwise, after which the program concludes, leaving the input variables in their initial state. The function does not modify the input lists or `n`. It handles all potential edge cases as specified by the input constraints, including when the sums of `x` and `y` are equal, or when one is greater than the other. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or where the lists `x` and `y` are not of the correct length or contain invalid values, as these cases are not explicitly addressed in the provided code.
