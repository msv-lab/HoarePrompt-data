Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately checks if the total number of stones in the second array is greater than the total number of stones in the first array. According to the problem description, the jury members can either move one stone from one pile to another or take one stone for themselves. Therefore, the total number of stones cannot increase. 

The program correctly prints 'No' if the total number of stones in the second array is greater than the total number of stones in the first array, as this means that stones were added, which is not allowed. If the total number of stones in the second array is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first array, it prints 'Yes', indicating that the records can be consistent. 

This program handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where the total number of stones in the two arrays is equal (in which case stones were moved but not taken), and where the total number of stones in the second array is less than the total number of stones in the first array (in which case stones were taken). 

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
