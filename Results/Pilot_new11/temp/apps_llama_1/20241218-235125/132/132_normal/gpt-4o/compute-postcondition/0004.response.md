The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `y` and assigns it to `total_y`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `total_x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, and `total_y` is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in `y`.**
