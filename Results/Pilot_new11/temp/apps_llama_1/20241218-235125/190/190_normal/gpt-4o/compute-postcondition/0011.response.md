The code increments `current_cost` by `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is greater than `t + 1` and `t` is 1, `length` is greater than 2. The value of `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + length - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `a` is `length`, `length` is greater than 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 2`**
