Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`. If `length` is less than 2, then `current_cost` is `current_cost` + 2 - `length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4, no additional conditions are applied to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than 4, then `current_cost` is `x + length - 4`.***
