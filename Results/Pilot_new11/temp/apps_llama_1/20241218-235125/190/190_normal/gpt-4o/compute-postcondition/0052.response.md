The value of `best_t` is updated to be equal to `t`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 2**
