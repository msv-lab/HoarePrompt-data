To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over a range from 1 to 101 (inclusive) and for each iteration `t`, it calculates a `current_cost` based on the differences between `t` and the lengths in list `a`. If `current_cost` is less than the current `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` and sets `best_t` to the current `t`.

Given this, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

1. `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. So, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
2. `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. So, `a` is still a list of integers.
3. `min_cost` will hold the minimum cost found among all iterations. Initially, it is set to positive infinity, so any calculated cost will be less than it, ensuring `min_cost` gets updated at least once if the list `a` is not empty. If `a` is empty, `current_cost` remains 0 for all `t`, and since the initial `min_cost` is infinity, `min_cost` will be updated to 0 after the first iteration.
4. `best_t` will be the value of `t` that resulted in the minimum `current_cost`. If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the loop's range is fixed and does not depend on `n` or `a`), `best_t` would remain -1. However, since the loop will always execute at least once (given the range from 1 to 101), `best_t` will be set to the value of `t` that yields the minimum cost.

Therefore, considering all variables and their possible values after the loop finishes:

- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `min_cost` will be the minimum cost calculated among all possible values of `t` from 1 to 101. If `a` is empty, `min_cost` will be 0.
- `best_t` will be the value of `t` that results in `min_cost`. If `a` is empty, since `current_cost` is 0 for all `t`, `best_t` will be 1 after the loop finishes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by adjusting lengths in `a` to be within 1 unit of `t` for `t` in the range 1 to 101, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that achieves `min_cost`.**
