The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `t + 1` to it. 

Given that `length` is the third element of `a`, `t` is 3, the equation becomes `current_cost += length - (3 + 1)` which simplifies to `current_cost += length - 4`. 

So, the new value of `current_cost` is the old value of `current_cost` plus `length - 4`, where `length` is the third element of `a`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `length` is the third element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is the old value of `current_cost` plus `length - 4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `length` is the third element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is the old value of `current_cost` plus `length - 4`**
