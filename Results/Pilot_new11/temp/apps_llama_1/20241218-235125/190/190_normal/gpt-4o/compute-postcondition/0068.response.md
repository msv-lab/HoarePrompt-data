Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`. If `length` is less than 2, `current_cost` is `current_cost + 2 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4, there is no change in `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`.**
