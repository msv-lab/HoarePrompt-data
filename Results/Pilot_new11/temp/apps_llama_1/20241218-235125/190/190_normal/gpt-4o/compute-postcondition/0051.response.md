The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`. The current value of `current_cost` is the initial cost plus the sum of adjustments for each `length` in `a` that is less than 1 or greater than 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to the initial cost plus the sum of adjustments for each `length` in `a` that is less than 1 or greater than 3, based on the formulae `1 - length` for `length < 1` and `length - 3` for `length > 3`, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2**
