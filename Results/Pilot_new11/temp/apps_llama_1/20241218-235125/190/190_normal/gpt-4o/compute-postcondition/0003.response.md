The code assigns the value -1 to the variable `best_t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `min_cost` is positive infinity, and `best_t` is -1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1**
