Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. It iterates over all possible values of `t` (from 1 to 100) and calculates the cost of adjusting the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for each `t`. The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of `t`, which ensures that it considers all possible solutions.
2. For each `t`, the program calculates the cost of adjusting the lengths of the sticks to be almost good. This is done by checking if each stick's length is less than `t - 1` or greater than `t + 1`, and adding the difference to the current cost if necessary.
3. The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value, which ensures that it finds the optimal solution.
4. The program prints the optimal `t` value and the minimum cost, which meets the output requirements of the problem description.

There are no obvious cases where the program does not follow the problem description. The program handles the input correctly, assuming that the input is valid, and it iterates over all possible values of `t` to find the optimal solution.

One minor note is that the program assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges (1 to 1000 for `n` and 1 to 100 for `a_i`). However, as mentioned in the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this assumption does not affect the correctness of the program.
