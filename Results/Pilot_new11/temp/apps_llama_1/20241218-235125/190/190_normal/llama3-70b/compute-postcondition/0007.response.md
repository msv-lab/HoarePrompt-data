`min_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The value of `t` equals `mid`, which is `sticks[n // 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `min_cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, and `min_t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`.**
