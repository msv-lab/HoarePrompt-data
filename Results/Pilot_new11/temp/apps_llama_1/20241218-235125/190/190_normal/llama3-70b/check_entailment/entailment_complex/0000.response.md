Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

- The program starts by reading the input, which is the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths (`sticks`). It sorts the stick lengths in ascending order.

- The initial minimum cost and optimal stick length (`t`) are calculated using the middle stick length as a starting point. This ensures that the program covers the median case, which is a good initial approximation for the minimum cost.

- The program then explores potential stick lengths from the middle value down to 1 and up to 100, calculating the minimum cost at each step. For each potential stick length `i`, it calculates the cost as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and `i` or its adjacent length (`i - 1` or `i + 1`).

- The program updates the minimum cost and optimal stick length whenever it finds a lower cost.

- Finally, the program prints the optimal stick length (`min_t`) and the minimum cost (`min_cost`) achievable.

The program handles all input scenarios within the defined constraints (1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= each stick length <= 100) and does not have any explicit error handling for edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element. However, since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, these cases are implicitly handled by the input validation and iteration logic.

The program's logic and implementation align with the problem description, ensuring that it always does what the problem description asks for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
