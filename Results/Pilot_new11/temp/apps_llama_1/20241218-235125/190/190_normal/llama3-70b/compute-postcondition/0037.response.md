The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1`. The value of `i` is `mid + 3`, where `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum of the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 3` and the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2`.**
