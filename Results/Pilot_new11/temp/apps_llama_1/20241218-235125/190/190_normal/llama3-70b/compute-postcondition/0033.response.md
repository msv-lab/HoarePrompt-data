The code `min_cost = cost` assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. 

Since `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1`, and `i` is `mid + 2`, the value of `min_cost` is equal to this sum.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`**
