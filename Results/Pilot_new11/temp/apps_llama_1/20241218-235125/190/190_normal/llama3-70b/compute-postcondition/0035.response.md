Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 2`, if the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1` is less than the current `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to this sum and `min_t` is updated to `mid + 2`.**
