The code assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. The previous values of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`, and `min_t` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and is at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, `min_cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`, and `min_t` has its current value**
