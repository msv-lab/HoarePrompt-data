Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The main issue with the code is that it starts checking for optimal `t` values from the median of the sticks' lengths (`mid`) and then checks all smaller and larger possible `t` values. However, this approach may not always find the global minimum cost.

A counterexample is when the input is:
```
2
1 100
```
In this case, the program will set `mid` to `1`, and then check smaller `t` values down to `0` and larger `t` values up to `101`. However, it will not find the optimal solution, which is to set `t` to `50`, with a cost of `49 + 49 = 98`.

A correct approach would be to check all possible `t` values from `1` to `100` (since the sticks' lengths are all between `1` and `100`), and calculate the cost for each `t` value. The `t` value with the minimum cost should be chosen as the optimal solution. 

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1)), abs(x - (t - 1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)

func()
```
This corrected version checks all possible `t` values and calculates the cost for each `t` value, ensuring that the optimal solution is found.
