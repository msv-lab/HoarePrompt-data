Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and is at least 2. If the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and `mid - 2` and `mid - 1` is less than the current `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to this sum and `min_t` is set to `mid - 2`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their current values.***
