The code assigns `min_t` the value of `i`, which is `mid + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `min_cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and the stick lengths `mid` and `mid + 1`, `min_t` is `mid + 1`, `i` is `mid + 1`**
