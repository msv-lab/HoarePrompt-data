The code updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to the current value of `cost`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, 
`sticks` is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers, 
`mid` is still the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, 
`min_t` is still the stick length that yields the previous `min_cost`, 
`i` is still `mid + 1`, 
the current value of `cost` is still the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and the stick lengths `mid` and `mid + 1`, 
and the current value of `cost` is still less than the previous `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `min_cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and the stick lengths `mid` and `mid + 1`, `min_t` is the stick length that yields the previous `min_cost`, `i` is `mid + 1`.**
