The code maps the input values to the variables `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` as integers. Since the input values are split by spaces, it implies that three separate values are provided. The precondition that 1 <= ki <= 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3 is still valid.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers between 1 and 1500 (inclusive), representing the time intervals of the garlands, `k1` is the first input integer, `k2` is the second input integer, `k3` is the third input integer**
