You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the time intervals of the garlands is 1. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second.

A counterexample is when k1 = 3, k2 = 4, and k3 = 5. In this case, the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is 1, but it is still not possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the least common multiple (lcm) of any two garlands is a multiple of the third garland, or if there exists a pair of garlands such that their lcm is equal to their gcd plus one of the other garland's period.

However, testing all these cases manually and proving their correctness through reasoning or counterexamples seems more efficient than modifying the code. So, looking at multiple examples we could say that the gcd check is necessary but not sufficient. For this particular task, one could also imagine an algorithm where for each second we would calculate, if at least one string will light up - but it should be tested more rigorously and there might exist a scenario that wouldn't pass the test.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit inputs, but it is implied that there are three positive integers k1, k2, and k3, representing the time intervals of the garlands, such that 1 <= ki <= 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. If `gcd_all` is 1, the string 'YES' has been printed. If `gcd_all` is greater than 1, the string 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of three implicitly provided positive integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, each between 1 and 1500, is 1. It prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, indicating that the numbers are coprime, and 'NO' otherwise. The function modifies the program state by printing a string to the console based on the GCD calculation. The input integers are obtained from standard input, implying user interaction. The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values), which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. After execution, the program state includes the printed result ('YES' or 'NO') and the calculated GCD value, although the latter is not explicitly returned or stored. The original input values (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`) are not modified. Potential edge cases, such as inputs outside the specified range or non-integer inputs, are not handled by the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
