Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the time intervals of the garlands is 1. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second.

A counterexample is when k1 = 3, k2 = 4, and k3 = 5. In this case, the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is 1, but it is still not possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the least common multiple (lcm) of any two garlands is a multiple of the third garland, or if there exists a pair of garlands such that their lcm is equal to their gcd plus one of the other garland's period.

However, testing all these cases manually and proving their correctness through reasoning or counterexamples seems more efficient than modifying the code. So, looking at multiple examples we could say that the gcd check is necessary but not sufficient. For this particular task, one could also imagine an algorithm where for each second we would calculate, if at least one string will light up - but it should be tested more rigorously and there might exist a scenario that wouldn't pass the test.
