Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks to determine if it is possible to switch on three garlands with time intervals k1, k2, and k3 such that each second after switching them on at least one garland is lit.

The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of k1, k2, and k3, and if the gcd is 1, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. However, this approach is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is 1, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland is lit every second. In fact, the problem description provides examples where the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is not 1, but it is still possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second (e.g., k1 = 2, k2 = 2, k3 = 3).

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible approach is to simulate the switching on of the garlands and check if at least one garland is lit every second. However, the provided program does not do this and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

For example, if we input k1 = 2, k2 = 4, k3 = 3, the program will print 'NO' because the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is 1, but it's actually 'NO' because there will be seconds where no garland is lit. If we input k1 = 2, k2 = 2, k3 = 3, the program will print 'YES' because the gcd of k1, k2, and k3 is not 1, but the problem description says we can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1, so it should actually print 'YES'. But there are some cases where the program does not do what the problem description says. 

For example, if we input k1 = 4, k2 = 2, k3 = 3, the program will print 'NO' which is correct, but if we input k1 = 2, k2 = 2, k3 = 4, the program will print 'NO' but the problem description says we can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1, so it should actually print 'NO' because if we choose these values we will have at least one garland lit every second. 

The problem description does not require us to find x1, x2, x3, it just tells us if it's possible to choose these values so that at least one garland is lit every second. The program does not correctly determine if this is possible for all potential cases. 

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
