The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it relies on three implicit positive integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, representing time intervals of garlands, where each `ki` is between 1 and 1500 (inclusive). 

To describe the functionality accurately, we must consider the output based on the given constraints. However, the specific output conditions (such as Cases) are not provided in the problem statement. Given the general format and the need to follow instructions precisely, we will have to adapt the answer format to fit the information provided.


Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but implicitly relies on three positive integers k1, k2, and k3, and returns a value based on these implicit parameters.**
