To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while b:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not zero (since in a boolean context, non-zero values are considered True and zero is considered False).

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500.
- `a` equals the original value of `b`.
- `b` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero because the loop condition is `while b:`. Since `b` is currently 0, which does not satisfy the condition for the loop to continue, we need to adjust the state of `b`.

However, we also have the information that `a` equals the original value of `b`, and since `b` must be non-zero for the loop to execute again, it implies that the original value of `b` (which is now equal to `a`) must also be non-zero. But the current value of `b` being 0 conflicts with the requirement that `b` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure `b` is non-zero, but given the provided information, we must note that `b` being 0 at the end of the previous iteration means we cannot simply proceed without considering how `b`'s state might change. The information about `c` does not directly impact the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust `c` for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500, `a` is non-zero (as it equals the original non-zero value of `b`), and `b` must be non-zero**
