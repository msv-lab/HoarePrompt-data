Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. It attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and then checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the numbers. However, this approach does not correctly determine if there are moments of time when all three garlands can be switched on such that at least one garland is lit every second after switching.

The issue with the code is that it only considers the divisors of the LCM, which does not guarantee that every second will have at least one lit garland. In fact, this code does not even attempt to find specific times `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` when the garlands should be switched on, which is the main goal of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as trying all possible combinations of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` and checking if there is at least one lit garland every second after switching. Alternatively, a more efficient algorithm can be developed to check if such a solution exists without actually finding the specific times. 

An example where this program fails is for inputs `5 5 7`. This code calculates the LCM as `35` (since `func_1(5, 5) = 5`, `func_1(5, 7) = 1`, and `func_1(7, 5) = 1`), which is divisible by `5`, `5`, and `7`, so it incorrectly prints "YES". However, upon examination, it is not possible to choose `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that every second after switching has at least one lit garland.
