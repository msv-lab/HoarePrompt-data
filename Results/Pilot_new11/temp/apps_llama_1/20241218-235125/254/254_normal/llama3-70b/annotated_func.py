#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and another parameter (let's call it c) are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1500, representing the time intervals of the garlands.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, and `c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, but since `b` is 0, `a` remains unchanged, implying the return of the original value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input positive integers `a` and `b`, both within the range of 1 to 1500, using the Euclidean algorithm. The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, leaving the original values of `a` and `b` modified within the function scope. Note that the function does not consider or modify a third parameter `c`, despite its mention in the annotations, as it is not actually passed to the function. The return value is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, which is `a` after the function's loop execution, with `b` being 0. The function handles all potential cases for `a` and `b` within the specified range and correctly computes their GCD.
