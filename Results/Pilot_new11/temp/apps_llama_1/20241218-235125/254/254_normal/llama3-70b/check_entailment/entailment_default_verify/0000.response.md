Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it seems that the original assessment is incorrect. The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second.

However, upon closer inspection, the problem description does not require a guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second; instead, it asks if it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

The provided code, although not clearly explained, does attempt to solve this problem by checking if the LCM of the three garland intervals is divisible by each of the intervals. This is not a correct approach to solve the problem, but it's not as flawed as the original assessment suggests.

The main issue with the code is the function `func_1(a, b)` which is supposed to calculate the GCD of two numbers but is used in a way that tries to calculate the LCM. The calculation of LCM is not accurate and does not correctly solve the problem.

However, after analyzing the problem and the output hints, it seems that the issue with the original assessment is that it does not consider the specific requirements of the problem. The output hints provide insight into the functionality of the `func_1(a, b)` function, which calculates the GCD of two numbers, and how it is used in the code.

But even with this information, the code provided is still incorrect because it doesn't correctly check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands.

Given the information available, the original assessment that the program is not correct is actually correct. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem, and the output hints, although providing insight into the functionality of the code, do not change the fact that the code is incorrect.

Therefore, after re-evaluating the program and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment.

Final: **False**
