To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer and is at least 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`.

Given Code:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

However, `max_len` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `max_len` is a variable that has been initialized before this line of code (since we can't determine its initial value, we'll consider it as part of the output state directly affected by this operation), the code compares the current value of `max_len` with the length of `substr` (which is 3 since `substr = s[0:3]`) and updates `max_len` to be the maximum of these two values.

Since `substr` is always 3 characters long (because it's initialized as `s[0:3]`), `len(substr)` will always be 3. Thus, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

Output State:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer and is at least 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 3.**
