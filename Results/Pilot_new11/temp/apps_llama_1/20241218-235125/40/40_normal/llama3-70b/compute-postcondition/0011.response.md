To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer and is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `substr` is a string equal to `s[0:2]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

From the initial state, we know `substr` equals `s[0:2]`, which means `substr` is a string of length 2 because it takes the first two characters of `s`. Therefore, `len(substr)` is 2.

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `max_len`. Since `max_len` is not defined in the initial state, we will consider its value as unknown before the execution of the given code snippet. After execution, `max_len` will be the maximum of its previous value (if it existed) and 2, because `len(substr)` is 2.

Given this, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer and is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `substr` is a string equal to `s[0:2]`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value (if any) and 2.

Since we don't know the previous value of `max_len`, we can say that `max_len` is now at least 2, because it has been compared with 2 and updated to be the maximum of the two values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is a string equal to `s[0:2]`, `max_len` is at least 2**
