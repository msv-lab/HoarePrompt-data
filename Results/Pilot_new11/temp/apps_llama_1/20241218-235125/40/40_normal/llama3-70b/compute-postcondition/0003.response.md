According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `max_len` is 0. Since `n` is already defined as the length of `s` and `s` is non-empty, `n` must be greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the range.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
