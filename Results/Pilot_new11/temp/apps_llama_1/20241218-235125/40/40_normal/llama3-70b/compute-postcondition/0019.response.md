To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 0 and ending at any index up to `n - 1`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

Loop statement: `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`

For the loop to execute, `j` must have a starting value and an ending value. The starting value of `j` is `i + 1`, and the ending value is `n + 1`. Since `i` is 1, the starting value of `j` is 2. 

Given that `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, and considering the loop's range starts from `i + 1` (which is 2) to `n + 1`, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, ensuring that `j` has at least one iteration.

State adjustments:
- `s` remains a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once, which aligns with the given condition that `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1.
- `i` is 1, as given.
- `max_len`'s state does not directly affect the execution of the loop but remains as defined.
- `j` starts at 2 (`i + 1`) and goes up to `n`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 0 and ending at any index up to `n - 1`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, `j` starts at 2**
