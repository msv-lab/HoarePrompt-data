The code prints the value of `max_len` if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0. The value of `max_len` is not changed by the code, and neither are the values of `s`, `n`, or `i`. The print statement only outputs the value to the console, but does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, and the value `max_len` if `max_len > 0` else 0 has been printed.**
