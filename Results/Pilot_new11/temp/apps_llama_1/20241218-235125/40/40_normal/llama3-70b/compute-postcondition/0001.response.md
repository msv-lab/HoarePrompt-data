The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 50 (inclusive). 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)**
