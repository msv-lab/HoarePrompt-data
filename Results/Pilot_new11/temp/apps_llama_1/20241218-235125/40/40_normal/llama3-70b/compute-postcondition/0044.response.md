The value of `substr` is updated to `s[i:j]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, `substr` becomes `s[2:5]`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, and the original `substr` was `s[2:5]`, the new `substr` will still be a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters. The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 5 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is `s[2:5]`, a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters**
