To calculate the result, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.


The initial state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `substr` is the first character of `s`.
- The current value of `substr` is not a palindrome.

The given code is: 
```
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (0) and the length of `substr`. 
Since `substr` is the first character of `s`, its length is 1.


So, `max_len` becomes `max(0, 1)`, which is 1.


The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`, and the relationship between `n` and `i`) are not affected by this code.


Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
- `max_len` is 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `substr` is the first character of `s` and is not a palindrome.


Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and `substr` is the first character of `s` and is not a palindrome.**
