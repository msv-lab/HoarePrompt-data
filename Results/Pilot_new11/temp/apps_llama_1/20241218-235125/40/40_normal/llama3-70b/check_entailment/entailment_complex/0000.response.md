Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s` from the standard input, as specified in the problem description. It does not handle invalid input cases, but this is explicitly stated as an assumption in the problem description.

2. **Substring generation**: The program generates all possible substrings of the input string `s` using a nested loop structure. This covers all substrings of `s`, as required by the problem description.

3. **Palindrome checking**: For each substring, the program checks whether it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`). If the substring is not a palindrome, its length is considered for updating the `max_len` variable.

4. **Maximum length calculation**: The program keeps track of the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far in the `max_len` variable. It updates `max_len` whenever it finds a longer non-palindromic substring.

5. **Output**: After checking all substrings, the program prints the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring if one exists (`max_len > 0`). Otherwise, it prints 0, as specified in the problem description.

The program's logic and implementation accurately reflect the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, under the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all potential cases.
