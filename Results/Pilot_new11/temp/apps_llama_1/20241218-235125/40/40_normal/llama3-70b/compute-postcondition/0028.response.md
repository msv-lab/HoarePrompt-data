According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 4, and `n` must be greater than 3 to allow `j` to reach 4.
Additionally, `i` remains the same because it is not modified in the loop statement.
`s` also remains unchanged, and since `j` has changed, `substr` will also change to be a string of length that will be checked in the loop body, but its current value would be `s[1:4]`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`**
