The given code snippet is trying to update the `max_len` variable with the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. 

However, the initial state does not mention the value of `max_len`. So, we assume `max_len` is some integer value before this line of code is executed.

Given the initial state, `substr` is a string of length 3. 

The provided code line `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` will compare the current value of `max_len` with the length of `substr` (which is 3) and update `max_len` with the maximum of these two values.

So, after executing this line of code, `max_len` will be the maximum value between its original value and 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 5 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is `s[2:5]`, a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the maximum value between its original value and 3**
