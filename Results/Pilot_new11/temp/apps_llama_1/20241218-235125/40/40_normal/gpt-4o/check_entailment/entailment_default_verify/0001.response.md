Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment that the program is not entirely correct seems to make sense. The program only checks if the string itself or its substrings (by removing the first or last character) are palindromes, but it does not check all possible substrings of the string. 

However, upon closer inspection of the provided code and the problem description, we can see that the program does attempt to check the string itself and its substrings by removing the first or last character. But it does not handle the case where all substrings are palindromes, or where the longest non-palindrome substring is not the string itself or its substrings by removing the first or last character.

The output hints provide a more detailed explanation of the functionality of the `func_1` function, which checks whether a given string is a palindrome. This function works correctly within the specified constraints.

Considering the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program seems to be missing a comprehensive check for all possible substrings. The original assessment points out a valid issue with the program, which is that it does not check all possible substrings.

Therefore, I will maintain the original assessment.

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the program does not comprehensively check all possible substrings of the string. The correct approach should involve checking all possible substrings to find the longest non-palindrome substring.

Final: **False**
