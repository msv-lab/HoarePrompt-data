Correctness: **False**

The given program is not entirely correct. It only checks if the string itself or its substrings (by removing the first or last character) are palindromes. However, it does not check all possible substrings of the string.

For example, if the input string is "aaab", the program will incorrectly output 0, because it checks if the string itself or its substrings (by removing the first or last character) are palindromes, and they are. But the substring "aab" is not a palindrome, and its length is 3, so the correct output should be 3.

To fix this, the program should check all possible substrings of the string, not just the string itself and its substrings by removing the first or last character. 

Here is a simple way to check all substrings:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if not is_palindrome(substr) and len(substr) > max_length:
                max_length = len(substr)
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
This code checks all possible substrings of the input string, and keeps track of the maximum length of a non-palindrome substring. If no such substring is found, it prints 0.
