The given code reads four non-negative integers from the input, representing the number of strings of specific types. 

`cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])`

This line of code assigns the input values to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. 

The `input()` function is used to read a line from the input, and this is done four times using a list comprehension. 

The `map(int,...)` function is then used to convert each of the input strings to an integer.

The output state will be the updated values of the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`, which are now integers.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt2` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt4` is a non-negative integer input**
