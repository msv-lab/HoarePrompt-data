You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem by determining whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed from the given brackets.

The condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` checks if the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, which is necessary for a regular bracket sequence.

The additional condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` ensures that there are enough regular bracket sequences (i.e., "()" pairs) to balance the irregular bracket sequences (i.e., ")(" pairs).

If both conditions are met, the program prints 1, indicating that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 0.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. The conditions are sufficient to guarantee the formation of a regular bracket sequence, and the program does not produce any incorrect results for the given examples. 

This explanation is based on the source code and the problem description. Given that no counterexamples were found and all conditions in the problem description have been accounted for in the code, the program appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: This function accepts four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` as input, representing counts of bracket sequences, and prints 1 if the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, and `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, otherwise it prints 0. The function does not return any values, it only prints the result. After the function concludes, the program state will have `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` as input integers, and either 1 or 0 will have been printed to the console, depending on the conditions met. The function does not modify the input integers and does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the input process. The function assumes that the input will always be four non-negative integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
