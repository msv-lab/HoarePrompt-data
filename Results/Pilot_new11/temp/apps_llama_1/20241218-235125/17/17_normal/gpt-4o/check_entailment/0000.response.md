Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem by determining whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed from the given brackets.

The condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` checks if the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, which is necessary for a regular bracket sequence.

The additional condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` ensures that there are enough regular bracket sequences (i.e., "()" pairs) to balance the irregular bracket sequences (i.e., ")(" pairs).

If both conditions are met, the program prints 1, indicating that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 0.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. The conditions are sufficient to guarantee the formation of a regular bracket sequence, and the program does not produce any incorrect results for the given examples. 

This explanation is based on the source code and the problem description. Given that no counterexamples were found and all conditions in the problem description have been accounted for in the code, the program appears to be correct.
