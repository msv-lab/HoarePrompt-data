The provided code snippet is a simple print statement for the variable `max_expr`. This statement does not modify any variables; it only outputs the value of `max_expr` to the console. 

Given the initial state:
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers,
- `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples,
- `max_value` equals the maximum mathematical expression from `expressions`,
- `max_expr` equals the string representation of `max_value`.

After executing the code, the variables retain their values since the print statement does not alter them. The value of `max_expr` is printed out, but the variables themselves remain unchanged. 

The only change is that the value of `max_expr` is returned at the output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers, `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples, `max_value` equals the maximum mathematical expression from `expressions`, `max_expr` equals the string representation of `max_value`, and `max_expr` has been returned at the output.**
