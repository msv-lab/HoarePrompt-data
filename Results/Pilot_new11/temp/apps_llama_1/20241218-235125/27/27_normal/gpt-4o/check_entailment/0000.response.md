Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to be correctly implemented based on the given problem description. It calculates all the possible expressions given the three input numbers x, y, and z, and then finds the maximum value among these expressions. The program correctly identifies the expression with the maximum value and prints it.

The program handles all the required cases, including calculating the values of all the given expressions and comparing them to find the maximum value. It also handles the case where there are multiple expressions with the same maximum value by printing the first one it encounters in the list.

The use of the `max()` function with a custom key function ensures that the maximum value is found correctly, and the corresponding expression is printed.

The code is also well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and a logical flow of operations. The use of a list of tuples to store the expressions and their corresponding values makes it easy to iterate over the expressions and find the maximum value.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
