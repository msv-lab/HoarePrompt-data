The code reads a line of input and splits it into three parts. These parts are then converted to floating point numbers and assigned to `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overwritten by the new values. The new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers, but we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the input. However, we can say that `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values of the three numbers input by the user.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers**
