The value of `a11` is assigned the value of `(z ** x) ** y`, which is equivalent to `z ** (x * y)`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, `a6`, `a7`, `a8`, `a9`, `a10` are not changed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`x` is a positive real number input by the user, 
`y` is a positive real number input by the user, 
`z` is a positive real number input by the user, 
`a1` is equal to `x`, 
`a2` is equal to `x`, 
`a3` is equal to `x`, 
`a4` is equal to `x`, 
`a5` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` to the power of `z`), 
`a6` is equal to `y` to the power of (`z` to the power of `x`), 
`a7` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` * `z`), 
`a8` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` * `z`), 
`a9` is equal to `z` to the power of (`x` to the power of `y`), 
`a10` is equal to `z` to the power of (`y` to the power of `x`), 
`a11` is equal to `z` to the power of (`x` * `y`).

Output State: **`x` is a positive real number input by the user, `y` is a positive real number input by the user, `z` is a positive real number input by the user, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a2` is equal to `x`, `a3` is equal to `x`, `a4` is equal to `x`, `a5` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` to the power of `z`), `a6` is equal to `y` to the power of (`z` to the power of `x`), `a7` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` * `z`), `a8` is equal to `y` to the power of (`x` * `z`), `a9` is equal to `z` to the power of (`x` to the power of `y`), `a10` is equal to `z` to the power of (`y` to the power of `x`), `a11` is equal to `z` to the power of (`x` * `y`)**
