You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

    a4 = (x ** z) ** y
    a5 = y ** x ** z
    a6 = y ** z ** x
    a7 = (y ** x) ** z
    a8 = (y ** z) ** x
    a9 = z ** x ** y
    a10 = z ** y ** x
    a11 = (z ** x) ** y
    a12 = (z ** y) ** x
    a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]
    b = ['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z', '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']
    print(b[a.index(max(a))])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program calculates the maximum value among the 12 given expressions and prints the corresponding expression. The program correctly handles the input of three real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point and calculates the values of the 12 expressions. It then finds the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression.

The program uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the list `a`, and the `index` method to find the index of the maximum value. This index is then used to print the corresponding expression from the list `b`.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the maximum value occurs multiple times, in which case it prints the first occurrence. The program also correctly handles the formatting of the output, printing the expressions without brackets when possible and with brackets when necessary.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I did not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function implicitly accepts three positive real numbers x, y, and z as input, each between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, calculates twelve different exponential expressions using these numbers, and prints the string representation of the expression that yields the maximum value. However, the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric input, input values outside the specified range, or input values with more or less than one digit after the decimal point. Additionally, the function does not return any value, instead, it prints the result directly. The state of the program after it concludes will be the printing of the expression that resulted in the maximum calculated value among the twelve exponential expressions, without any explicit error handling or return value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
