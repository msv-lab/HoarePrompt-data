The value of `a2` is assigned the result of the expression `x ** z ** y`. According to the order of operations in Python, the exponentiation operator `**` is evaluated from right to left, so this expression is equivalent to `x ** (z ** y)`. The initial state of `x`, `y`, and `z` being positive real numbers input by the user and `a1` being a positive real number equal to `x` is still valid.

Output State: **`x` is a positive real number input by the user, `y` is a positive real number input by the user, `z` is a positive real number input by the user, `a1` is equal to `x`, and `a2` is equal to `x ** (z ** y)`**
