Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` equals `mid` and `high` is greater than `low`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` is less than or equal to `mid`, where `mid` is updated to `(low + (mid - 1) + 1) // 2` and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`.***
