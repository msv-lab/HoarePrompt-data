You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a binary search solution that attempts to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least full keg after pouring a glass of `s` liters. 

Here's why it works:
- The program first reads the input, sorts the keg volumes in ascending order, and initializes the search range `[low, high]` for the binary search.
- The binary search iteratively calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range and checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured from all kegs, assuming each keg is `mid` liters or less full, is less than the target amount `s`.
- If the total amount is less than `s`, it means that the current `mid` value is too small, so it updates `low` to `mid`.
- If the total amount is not less than `s`, it means that the current `mid` value might be too large, so it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- The binary search continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`, at which point `low` is the maximum amount that can be left in the least full keg.
- Finally, it checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured when each keg is `low` liters or less full is exactly `s`. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `low`.

The program handles edge cases correctly. For instance, if `s` is greater than the total amount of kvass in all kegs, it will correctly print `-1`. 

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program seems correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, s is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i is such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `v` is the original sorted list of integers, `low` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v) >= s` or the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition if no such integer is found, `high` is the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition, `mid` is the value that satisfies the condition or the largest value that does not satisfy the condition if no such value is found
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `v` is the original sorted list of integers, `low` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v) >= s` or the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition if no such integer is found, `high` is the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition, `mid` is the value that satisfies the condition or the largest value that does not satisfy the condition if no such value is found. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, then -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in `v` is equal to `s`, and the value of `low` has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
