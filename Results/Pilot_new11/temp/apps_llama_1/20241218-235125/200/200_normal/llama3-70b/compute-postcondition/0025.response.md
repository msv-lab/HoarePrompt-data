Postcondition: **`n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `v` is the original sorted list of integers, `low` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v) >= s` or the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition if no such integer is found, `high` is the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition, `mid` is the value that satisfies the condition or the largest value that does not satisfy the condition if no such value is found. The current value of `low` is such that the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element `x` in `v` does not equal `s`.**
