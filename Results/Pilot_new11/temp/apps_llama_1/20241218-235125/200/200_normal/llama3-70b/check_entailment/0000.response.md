Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the smallest keg after pouring `s` liters. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. It first reads the input values `n` and `s`, and then reads the volumes of the kegs into a list `v`. It sorts this list in ascending order.

2. The code then initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, where `low` is 0 and `high` is the volume of the smallest keg. This sets the initial range for the binary search.

3. Inside the while loop, the code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range, and then calculates the total amount of kvass that can be poured if `mid` liters are left in each keg. If the total amount poured is less than `s`, it means that we need to pour more, so it updates `low` to `mid`. If the total amount poured is greater than or equal to `s`, it means that we can pour `s` liters with `mid` liters left in each keg, so it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.

4. The loop continues until `low` and `high` converge, at which point `low` will be the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the smallest keg after pouring `s` liters.

5. Finally, the code checks if it's possible to pour exactly `s` liters with `low` liters left in each keg. If it is, it prints `low`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the code, and after examining the code and its logic, no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
