Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 0, and either `remaining_kvass` is 0 in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `remaining_kvass` is not 0.***
