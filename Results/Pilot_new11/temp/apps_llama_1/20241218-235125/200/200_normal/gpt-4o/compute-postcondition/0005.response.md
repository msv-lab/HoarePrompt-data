The given code snippet only contains a print statement, which prints the value -1 to the console. This statement does not modify any variables, so the values of `n`, `s`, `volumes`, and `total_volume` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is less than `s`, and the value -1 has been printed and returned at the output state.**
