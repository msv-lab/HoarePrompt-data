The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
