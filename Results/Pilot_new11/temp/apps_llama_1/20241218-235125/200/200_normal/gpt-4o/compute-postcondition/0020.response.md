The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this case, there is no loop provided in the given code snippet. Assuming it's part of a larger loop structure that hasn't been shown, the `continue` statement would cause the loop to move on to the next iteration without executing any of the code that follows it within the same loop iteration.

Given the provided initial state and considering the effect of the `continue` statement, none of the variable values are directly altered by the `continue` statement itself. The `continue` statement affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop, but without the loop's context, we can only confirm that it doesn't directly change variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and either `remaining_kvass` is 0 or `remaining_kvass` is not 0, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
