The code updates the values of `n` and `s` with the input values. The `map` function applies the `int` function to the split input, which means it converts the input to integers. The `split` function splits the input into two parts, which are then assigned to `n` and `s`, respectively.

Since the input is not specified, `n` is assigned an input integer and `s` is assigned an input integer.

The preconditions that `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, and there is a list of `n` positive integers `v_i` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, and there is a list of `n` positive integers `v_i` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^3, 1 <= `s` <= 10^12, and 1 <= `v_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`.**
