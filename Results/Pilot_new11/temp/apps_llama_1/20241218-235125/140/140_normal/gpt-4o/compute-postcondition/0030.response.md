The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the actual in-degree of that vertex, `queue` contains one less node than before and is not empty, `count` is 1, and `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`.**
