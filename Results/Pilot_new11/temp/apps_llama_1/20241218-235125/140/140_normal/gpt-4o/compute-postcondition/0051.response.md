The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the end of the `queue`. This operation modifies the `queue` by increasing its size by 1, which previously had one less node than before. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The `graph` remains a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list of neighbors, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The `in_degree` still reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after further processing. The `count` is consistent with the processing of one more node in the graph. The `node` is still the leftmost node that was previously in the `queue`. For each `neighbor`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, after being decremented by 1 from its previous value, indicating that `neighbor` has no incoming edges from other vertices that have not been processed yet.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list of neighbors, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after further processing, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees and now includes the `neighbor` node, `node` is the leftmost node that was previously in the `queue`, and `count` is consistent with the processing of one more node in the graph, for each `neighbor`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
