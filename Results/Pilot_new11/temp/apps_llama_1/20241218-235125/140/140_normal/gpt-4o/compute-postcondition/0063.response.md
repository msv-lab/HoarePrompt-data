The code removes the leftmost node from the `queue` and assigns it to the `node` variable. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing, `queue` is one node shorter and does not contain the last node that was processed, `node` is the node that was just removed from the `queue`, and `count` is consistent with the processing of all neighbors of the nodes in the graph.**
