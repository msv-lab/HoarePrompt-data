Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements a solution to the problem of determining if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The function `func_1` checks if a directed graph, represented by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `edges`, can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. It iterates through all edges, checking if the removal of each edge results in an acyclic graph. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns 'NO'.

The function `has_cycle` checks if a directed graph contains a cycle. It uses the concept of in-degree to determine if there are any nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0. If it finds that there are nodes that are not reachable, it returns `True`, indicating the presence of a cycle.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, including empty graphs, graphs with multiple connected components, and graphs with no nodes having an in-degree of 0. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

For example, in the first example, the code correctly identifies that removing the edge `2 -> 3` makes the graph acyclic, and returns 'YES'. In the second example, the code correctly identifies that removing at least two edges is required to make the graph acyclic, and returns 'NO'.

The code assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, it does not handle cases where the input is invalid, such as an empty list of edges or a graph with self-loops. However, since we assume that the input will always be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

In conclusion, the code correctly implements a solution to the problem, handles all potential cases, and produces the expected output for the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
