Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program appears to be correct in determining whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The `func_1` function constructs a graph from the given edges and checks if the graph is acyclic using the `has_cycle` function. If the graph is already acyclic, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iterates over all edges, temporarily removes each edge, and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses the topological sorting algorithm to check for cycles in the graph. It calculates the in-degree of each node and uses a queue to process nodes with in-degree 0. If all nodes are processed (i.e., the count equals the number of nodes), the graph is acyclic, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the graph contains a cycle.

This program correctly handles the cases where the graph is already acyclic, can be made acyclic by removing one edge, or cannot be made acyclic by removing one edge. The use of the topological sorting algorithm in the `has_cycle` function ensures that the program can efficiently detect cycles in the graph.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, removing the edge 2 → 3 makes the graph acyclic, and the program correctly returns 'YES'. In the second example, removing at least two edges (2 → 1 and 2 → 3) is necessary to make the graph acyclic, and the program correctly returns 'NO'.

Without a specific counterexample, it appears that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
