The function checks if a directed graph, represented by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `edges`, can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. It returns 'YES' if such an edge exists and 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all edges, checking if the removal of each edge results in an acyclic graph. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns 'NO'. The function handles graphs with any number of vertices and edges, including empty graphs, and correctly identifies whether the removal of a single edge can make the graph acyclic.
