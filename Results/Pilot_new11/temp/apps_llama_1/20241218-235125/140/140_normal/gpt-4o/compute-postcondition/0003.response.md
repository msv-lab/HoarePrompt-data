The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `in_degree[v]` is 0, so the new value of `in_degree[v]` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex, `n` is at least 1, `in_degree` has all values as 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is 1, `u` is a vertex in `graph` and `graph[u]` is not empty, `v` is the first vertex in `graph[u]`**
