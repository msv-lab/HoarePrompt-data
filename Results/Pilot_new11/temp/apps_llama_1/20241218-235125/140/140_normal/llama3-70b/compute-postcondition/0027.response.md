The function `func_1` accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, and `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists or sets of integers representing the visited vertices and the current recursion stack, respectively. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: Returns True if the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor.
- Case_2: Returns True if a cycle is detected in the graph.
- Case_3: Returns True indicating a boolean type value.
- Case_4: Returns True for a node with at least two neighbors, where the node is visited and in the recursion stack.
- Case_5: Returns True for a node with at least three neighbors, where the node is visited, in the recursion stack, and has a third neighbor.
- Case_6: Returns True for a node with at least three neighbors, where the node is marked as visited and in the recursion stack.
- Case_7: Returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a directed graph `graph`, and lists `visited` and `rec_stack`, and return a boolean value indicating the result of the evaluation based on the conditions specified in the cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, and returns a boolean value based on the evaluation of the node in the context of the graph, visited nodes, and recursion stack.**
