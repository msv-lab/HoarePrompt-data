The code sets `rec_stack[node]` to `False`. This indicates that the node is no longer in the recursion stack. The states of the other variables are not affected. The graph remains unchanged, and the visitation state of all neighbors of `node` after traversal is still reflected in `visited`. 

Output State: **`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` remains unchanged, `visited` reflects the visitation state of all neighbors of `node` after traversal, and `rec_stack[node]` is `False`, representing the updated recursion stack state after visiting all neighbors of `node`.**
