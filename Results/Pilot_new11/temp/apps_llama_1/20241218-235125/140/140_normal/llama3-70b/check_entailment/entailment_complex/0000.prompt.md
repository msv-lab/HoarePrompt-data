You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, visited and rec_stack are lists or sets of integers representing the visited vertices and the current recursion stack, respectively.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` remains unchanged, `visited` reflects the visitation state of all neighbors of `node` after traversal, and `rec_stack` represents the recursion stack state after visiting all neighbors of `node`. If the graph contains a cycle reachable from `node`, the program returns True; otherwise, the return value depends on the implementation of `func_1`. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the initial state of `visited` and `rec_stack` is preserved.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks for the presence of a cycle in a directed graph starting from a given vertex `node`. It accepts four parameters: `node` (the current vertex), `graph` (the adjacency list or matrix representation of the graph), `visited` (a list or set of visited vertices), and `rec_stack` (a list or set representing the current recursion stack). The function returns `True` if a cycle is detected and `False` otherwise. After execution, the `visited` list reflects the visitation state of all vertices reachable from `node`, and the `rec_stack` represents the recursion stack state after visiting all these vertices. The function handles various cases, including when the graph contains a cycle reachable from `node`, when `node` has unvisited neighbors, and when `node` has no neighbors. The function's return value indicates whether a cycle is detected, and its side effects update the `visited` and `rec_stack` data structures to reflect the traversal state. Edge cases, such as an empty graph or a node with no neighbors, are implicitly handled by the function's recursive structure and the base case `return False` statement.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
