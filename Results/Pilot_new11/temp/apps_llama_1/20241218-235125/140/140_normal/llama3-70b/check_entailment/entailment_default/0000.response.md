Correctness: **False**

The code provided checks if a graph contains a cycle, and if it does, it prints "NO". However, the problem statement asks to determine if it's possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The provided code does not attempt to remove edges and check if the resulting graph is acyclic.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the graph contains a cycle, but removing one edge would make it acyclic. For example, consider a graph with nodes A, B, and C, and edges A->B, B->C, and C->A. This graph contains a cycle, but removing the edge C->A would make it acyclic. However, the provided code would simply print "NO" without considering the possibility of removing one edge to make the graph acyclic.

To correctly solve this problem, the code would need to iterate over all edges in the graph, temporarily remove each edge, and then check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge that, when removed, makes the graph acyclic, it should print "YES". If it checks all edges and none of them make the graph acyclic when removed, it should print "NO".
