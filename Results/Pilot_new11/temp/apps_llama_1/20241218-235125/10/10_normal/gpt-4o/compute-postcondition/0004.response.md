The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` assigns the input values to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. 

Since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are coordinates between 1 and `n` or `m`, their values will be input integers between 1 and `n` or `m`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integer coordinates between 1 and `n` or `m`, counts are between 0 and `d`-1, `sofas` is an empty list.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, counts are between 0 and `d`-1, `sofas` is an empty list**
