Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `j-th` tuple elements in `sofas`. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, then the lists `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are updated according to the given conditions based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
