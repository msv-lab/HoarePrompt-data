Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `left_count[i]` is now `left_count[i] + 1`, and `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[i]` is now `right_count[i] + 1` if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, otherwise the state remains unchanged, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `bottom_count[i]` is now `bottom_count[i] + 1`, otherwise `bottom_count` remains unchanged, `j` is the next index, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers corresponding to the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, and If `i` equals `j`, the loop skips to the next iteration**
