The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the `sofas` list. The previous values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `counts` are not affected by this operation. The `sofas` list initially contains two tuples: `(n, m)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, but since `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` are new input integers and the code is appending another tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, the list will now contain three tuples.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 1 and `d`-1, `sofas` is a list containing three tuples: `(n, m)`, `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
