The code `n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided. The `input()` function accepts a string input, `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `split()` splits the string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace. The `map(int,...)` function then converts each substring in the list to an integer.

Given the initial state that `n` and `m` are between 1 and 10^5, and considering the input operation, `n` and `m` will be assigned integer values based on the input provided. 

Since `d` is an integer input value between 1 and 10^5 and its value is not affected by the given code, `d` remains an integer input value between 1 and 10^5.

The code does not affect the range of coordinates, which remain between 1 and `n` or `m`. Similarly, the counts remain between 0 and `d`-1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer input value between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, coordinates are between 1 and `n` or `m`, and counts are between 0 and `d`-1.
Output State: **`d` is an integer input value between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, coordinates are between 1 and `n` or `m`, and counts are between 0 and `d`-1**
