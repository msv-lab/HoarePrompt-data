Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, then `i` and `j` are both 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0.***
