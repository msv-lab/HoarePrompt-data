The value of `x1` is assigned the first element of the tuple `sofas[i]`, the value of `y1` is assigned the second element of the tuple `sofas[i]`, the value of `x2` is assigned the third element of the tuple `sofas[i]`, and the value of `y2` is assigned the fourth element of the tuple `sofas[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 0, the first tuple in the `sofas` list is used for the assignment. 
Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`.**
