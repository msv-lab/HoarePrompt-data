Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the third tuple of `sofas`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
