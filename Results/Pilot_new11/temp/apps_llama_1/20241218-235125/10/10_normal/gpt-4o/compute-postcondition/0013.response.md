The given Python code snippet assigns the input values to the variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. 

`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned the values of four input integers.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 0 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers**
