The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified, we assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop that iterates over some sequence, and `j` is the index of the next iteration.


Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, and `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, and `j` is the next index, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
