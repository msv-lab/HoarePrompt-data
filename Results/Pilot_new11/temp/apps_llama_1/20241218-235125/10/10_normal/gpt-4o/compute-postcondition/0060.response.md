Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the 3rd tuple of `sofas`. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[2]` is the original value of `top_count[2]` plus 1. Regardless of the condition, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `right_count` remain as per their initial conditions since the code does not affect them.***
