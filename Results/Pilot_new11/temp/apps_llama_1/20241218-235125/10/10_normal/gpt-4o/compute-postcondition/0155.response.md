The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` integers, `target_sofa` is 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `left_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_l`, the current value of `right_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_r`, the current value of `top_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_t`, and the current value of `bottom_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
