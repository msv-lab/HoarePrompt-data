The value of `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `top_count[i]` is an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`d` is still an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are still input integer values, `sofas` is still a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are still input integers, `left_count` is still a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is still a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are still the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are still the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `top_count[i]` is the input integer plus 1, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.
