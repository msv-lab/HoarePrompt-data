Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, `s` is not equal to `sofa`, if the first element of the first sublist of `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist of `s` and the second element of the first sublist of `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sublist of `s`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remain unchanged, all equal to 0.**
