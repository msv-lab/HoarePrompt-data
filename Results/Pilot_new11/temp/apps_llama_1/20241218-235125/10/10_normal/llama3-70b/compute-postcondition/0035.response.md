Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `right`, `left`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the comparing elements of `sofa` and `s`: if the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` equals the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `right` is increased by 1; if the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` equals the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1; if `sofa[0][1]` is less than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `top` is increased by 1; if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1, with the previous conditions for `right` and `left` still applying.**
