Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The current values of `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` are all 0. If the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then the current value of `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. If the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then the current value of `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. The second element of `sofa` is less than the second element of `s` and the first element of `sofa` is equal to the first element of `s`.**
