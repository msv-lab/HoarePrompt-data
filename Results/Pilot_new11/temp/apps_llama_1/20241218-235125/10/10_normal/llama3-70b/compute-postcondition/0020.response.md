Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the `sofas` list. If the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `right` is increased by 1. Additionally, if the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. In all cases, `right` will be equal to its previous value plus 1 if the condition is met, otherwise, its value remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify it.***
