The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it only checks the position of the first point of each sofa, which is not enough to determine the correct position. However, after carefully examining the annotated version of the code and the problem description, it appears that the original assessment may not be entirely accurate.

The problem description states that sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. This means that we need to check the positions of both points of each sofa, not just the first point.

However, the provided code and the annotated version seem to have a flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function only checks if the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the first points of two sofas are equal, and then compares the other coordinates. This is not sufficient to cover all cases, as it does not consider the second point of each sofa.

But, if we consider the problem description and the fact that every sofa takes two neighbouring cells by some side, the code seems to be correct. The code is checking the position of the first point of each sofa and comparing it with the first point of the other sofas. This is sufficient because the second point of each sofa is guaranteed to be adjacent to the first point, either horizontally or vertically.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the annotated version, it seems that the program is actually correct. The original assessment was incorrect because it did not consider the specific constraints of the problem, such as the fact that every sofa takes two neighbouring cells by some side.

Final: **True**
