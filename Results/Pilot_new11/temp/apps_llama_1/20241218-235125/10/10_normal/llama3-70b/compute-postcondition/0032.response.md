Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. If the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` equals the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `right` is increased by 1. Additionally, if the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` equals the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. If `sofa[0][1]` is less than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `top` is increased by 1, and the previous conditions for `right` and `left` still apply. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
