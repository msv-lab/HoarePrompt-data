Functionality: **The function determines whether it's possible to move from a position marked 'G' to a position marked 'T' in a given string `line` with a step size of `k`, without encountering an obstacle marked '#'. The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` through user input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`. However, the value of `n` is not used in the function. The function prints 'YES' if the path exists and 'NO' otherwise, analyzing the string `line` character by character from the position of 'G' to the position of 'T' with the specified step size. The function considers all possible paths with the given step size, handles edge cases where 'G' and 'T' are in different positions, and correctly identifies the path as reachable only if it can reach 'T' without encountering any obstacles. The final state of the program after execution will be that it has printed 'YES' if a path from 'G' to 'T' with step size `k` without obstacles exists, and 'NO' otherwise, based on the input string `line` and the step size `k`.**
