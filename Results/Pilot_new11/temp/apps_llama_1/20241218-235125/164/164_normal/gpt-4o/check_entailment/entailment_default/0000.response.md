Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not check if there's a jump from the position 'G' to the left of 'T' when 'G' is to the right of 'T'. The current code only checks for jumps to the right. It also does not consider jumps to the right when 'G' is to the left of 'T' if the difference between 'G' and 'T' is not a multiple of 'k'. To fix this, the code should check both directions (left and right) and consider all possible jumps.

For example, if the input is "6 2..GT..", the program should return "NO" because the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with even indices, thus it won't be able to reach the insect. However, the current code does not correctly handle such cases.

The output hints seem to agree with the code and highlight the issue. The function only checks for a path from 'G' to 'T' with the specified step size in one direction, and does not consider all possible paths or jumps.

To make the code correct, it should be modified to handle both directions and all possible jumps. 

Here's an example of how to modify the code:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = set([G_pos])
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for jump in [k, -k]:
            new_pos = pos + jump
            if 0 <= new_pos < len(line) and line[new_pos]!= '#' and new_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    print('NO')

func()
```
This modified code uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search, checking all possible jumps in both directions. If it finds a path from 'G' to 'T', it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
