The values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` are swapped. Previously, the value of `G_pos` was greater than the value of `T_pos`, but now `G_pos` will hold the value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` will hold the value of `G_pos`. Therefore, the new value of `G_pos` is less than the new value of `T_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the original index of 'T' in `line`, `T_pos` is the original index of 'G' in `line`, and the current value of `G_pos` is less than the current value of `T_pos`**
