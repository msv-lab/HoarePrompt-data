Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1. If the character at index 1 of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1 and `t` depends on the character at index 1 of string `s`. If the character at index 1 of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1 and `g` depends on the character at index 1 of string `s`. For any other character at index 1 of string `s`, the state of `t` and `g` is unchanged, with `t` depending on the character at index 1 of string `s` and `g` depending on the character at index 1 of string `s`.***
