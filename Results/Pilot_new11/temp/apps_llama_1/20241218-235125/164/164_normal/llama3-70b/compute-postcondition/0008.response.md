The code `t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `t`. Initially, `g` was -1, `t` was -1, and the index `i` was initialized to 0. Since the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T' and `i` is 0, `t` becomes 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'**
