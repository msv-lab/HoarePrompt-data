Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 2 and `g` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1 and `t` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`. For any other character at index 2 of string `s`, the state of `t` and `g` remains unchanged, with `t` depending on the character at index 2 of string `s` and `g` depending on the character at index 2 of string `s`.**
