Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with at least one `[` and one `]`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last `]` in `s`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are indices of `:` characters between `[` and `]` in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to `start_colon + 1` and is the current index in the loop, the current value of `i` is such that `s[i]` equals `|`, and `pipe_count` is 0, which will change as the program progresses, given that it has entered the if condition due to encountering a `|` character at index `i`**
