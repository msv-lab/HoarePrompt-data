Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with at least one `[` and one `]`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last `]` in `s`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are indices of `:` characters between `[` and `]` in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to `start_colon + 2`, if `s[i]` equals `|`, then `pipe_count` is the previous value of `pipe_count` plus 1, otherwise the state of `pipe_count` remains unchanged***
