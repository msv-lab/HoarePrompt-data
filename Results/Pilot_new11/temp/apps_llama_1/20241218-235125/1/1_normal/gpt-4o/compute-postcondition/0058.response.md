The `break` statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 2`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
