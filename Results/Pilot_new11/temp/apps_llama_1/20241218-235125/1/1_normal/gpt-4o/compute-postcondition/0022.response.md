Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is either -1 if no '[' is found in `s` or the index of the first '[' in `s` otherwise, `i` is `n - 1`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `bind` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `bind` remains -1.***
