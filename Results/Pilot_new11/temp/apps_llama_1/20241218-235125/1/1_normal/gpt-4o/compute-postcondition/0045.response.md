According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind`, `bind`, and `i`. If `i` is less than `bind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, and `i` is the last index that was processed which is `ind + 1` if `s[ind + 1]` equals ':' or the last index before the loop breaks, otherwise it will be `ind + 1` because this is the first index that we start to process and if we reach the break condition at `ind + 1` the state will not change. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `ind + 2` if the state changed or `ind + 1` if it didn't. In all cases, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `bind` so the condition must be `ind + 2` is less than or equal to `bind` if the state changed or `ind + 1` is less than `bind` if the state didn't change, which simplifies to `ind + 2` is less than or equal to `bind` because if `ind + 1` equals `bind` and `s[ind + 1]` equals ':' the state will change and `i` will be `ind + 1` and the loop will not execute again because the break condition is met at the start of the loop. So `bind` must be greater than `ind + 1`, and since we know `ind` is less than `bind` then `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`, if `s[i]` equals ':', then `start_colon` is `i` which equals `ind + 1`**
