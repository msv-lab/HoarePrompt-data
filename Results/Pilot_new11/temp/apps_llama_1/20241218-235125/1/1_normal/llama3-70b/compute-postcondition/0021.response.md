Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is '[', then `f` is `True`. If `s[1]` is ':', then either `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the state of the variables remains unchanged. For all other cases of `s[1]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
