The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `ind` is assigned the value 1. The values of `s` and `n` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1**
