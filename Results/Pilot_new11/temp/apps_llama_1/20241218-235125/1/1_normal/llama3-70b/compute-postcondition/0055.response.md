Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, if `s` at index `i` is ':', then `bind` is equal to `i` or `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle other conditions***
