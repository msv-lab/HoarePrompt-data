The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is 0, the current value of `f` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
