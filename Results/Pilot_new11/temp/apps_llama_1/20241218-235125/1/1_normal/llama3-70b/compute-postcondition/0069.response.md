According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `ind`, and `bind`. If `i` is less than `bind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 1`, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and `ind` must be less than `bind - 1`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. So, `i` becomes `ind + 2`. Since `i` is now `ind + 2`, `ind` must be less than `bind - 2` to ensure the loop can execute again, and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`. 

State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and `ind` must be less than `bind - 2`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `f` is `True`, if the character at index `i - 1` in `s` is '|', then `ans` is 5, otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged as 4**
