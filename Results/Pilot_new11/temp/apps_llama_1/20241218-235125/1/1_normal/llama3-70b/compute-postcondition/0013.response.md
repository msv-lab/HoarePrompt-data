Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':'; if `f` is True, then `ind` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ind` remains -1 and `f` remains False***
