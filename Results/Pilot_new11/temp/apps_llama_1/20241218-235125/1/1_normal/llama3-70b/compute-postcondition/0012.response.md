Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, if `f` is True, then `ind` is 0, `f` remains True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is False, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `ind` being -1, `f` being False, and `i` being 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` being ':'**
