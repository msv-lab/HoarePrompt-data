Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` because a ']' character is found in `s`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character if a ']' character is found before it and is not equal to -1, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and is not equal to -1, and the current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to the current value of `bind`, meaning that a '[' followed by a ':' and a ']' before a ':' have been found in `s` with the ':' after the '[' having an index greater than or equal to the index of the ':' before which a ']' was found.**
