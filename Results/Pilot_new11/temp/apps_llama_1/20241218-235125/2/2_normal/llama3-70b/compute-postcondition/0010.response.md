To calculate the impact of the code on the program, we first need to understand what the code does. The line of code provided calculates the sum of the digits of the number `i`.

Given that `i` is 2, the sum of its digits is simply 2, because there's only one digit. 

Thus, `digit_sum` is updated to 2.

The states of the other variables (`x`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_num`) are not directly affected by this line of code. However, the relationship between `digit_sum` and the other variables (`max_sum` and `max_num`) might be affected based on subsequent code not shown here, but given the initial state, we can only conclude the direct impact on `digit_sum`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, and the values of `max_sum` and `max_num` remain as initially stated, with `max_num` being possibly 1 or 2, and `digit_sum` being greater than 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_num` is possibly 1 or 2, and the initial relationship between `digit_sum` and `max_sum` holds but `max_sum` could be greater than or equal to 2 based on prior information.**
