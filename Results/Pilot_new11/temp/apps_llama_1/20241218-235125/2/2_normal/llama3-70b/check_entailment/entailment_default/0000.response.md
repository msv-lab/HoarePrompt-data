Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the largest integer that doesn't exceed the input `x` and has the maximum sum of digits. However, the current implementation returns the first number encountered with the maximum sum of digits, not necessarily the largest one. 

For example, if the input is 48, the maximum sum of digits is 12, which can be obtained from both 39 and 48. The current implementation will return 39, which is the first number it encounters with the maximum sum of digits, but the problem statement requires the program to return the largest such number, which is 48.

The correct implementation should keep track of the maximum number with the maximum sum of digits, not just the first one encountered. This can be achieved by modifying the condition in the if statement to update `max_num` only if the current number `i` is greater than `max_num`, in addition to having a larger sum of digits. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum or (digit_sum == max_sum and i > max_num):
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
    print(max_num)
```
