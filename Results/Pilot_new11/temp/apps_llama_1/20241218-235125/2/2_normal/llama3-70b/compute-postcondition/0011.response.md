`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `max_sum` is now 2.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_num` is possibly 1 or 2, and `max_sum` is 2**
