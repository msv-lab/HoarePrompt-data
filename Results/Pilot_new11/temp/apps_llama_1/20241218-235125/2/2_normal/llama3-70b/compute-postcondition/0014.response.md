According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `x` must be greater than 3 to satisfy the loop condition. The states of `max_num`, `digit_sum`, and `max_sum` do not affect the loop condition directly, but based on the given conditions, `digit_sum` is 2. 

State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 2**
