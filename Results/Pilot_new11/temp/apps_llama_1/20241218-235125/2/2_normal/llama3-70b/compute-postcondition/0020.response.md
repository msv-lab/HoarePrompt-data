The `print(max_num)` statement only prints the value of `max_num` and does not change the state of any variable. Therefore, the values of `x`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `x`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of digits of any number in the range from 1 to `x`, and `max_num` is the number in the range from 1 to `x` whose digits sum up to `max_sum`, and the value of `max_num` has been printed**
