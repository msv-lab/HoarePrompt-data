The code calculates the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 1, the sum of its digits is 1. Therefore, `digit_sum` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
