Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_num` is 2 and `digit_sum` is 2 and `max_sum` is 2, otherwise the state of `max_num`, `digit_sum`, and `max_sum` remains as it was before the if condition, with `digit_sum` being 2 and the relationship between `digit_sum` and `max_sum` holding.**
