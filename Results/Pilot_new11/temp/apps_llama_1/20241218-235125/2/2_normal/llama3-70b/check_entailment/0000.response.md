Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the given program is that it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number. This is inefficient for large inputs. For example, if the input is 10^18, the program will take an impractically long time to run. This is because the program is checking every number from 1 to the input number, which is unnecessary.

A more efficient approach would be to start from the input number and decrement it until we find a number with the maximum sum of digits. Since the problem states that if there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them, this approach ensures that we find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly due to its inefficiency: if the input is 999999999999999999 (a large number close to 10^18), the program will not finish running in a reasonable amount of time. 

In this case, a more efficient algorithm would start from the input number and try to maximize the sum of digits by maximizing the digits in the most significant positions. For example, the number 999999... (a number consisting of all 9s) has the maximum sum of digits among all numbers less than or equal to 10^18. 

To improve the program, we can use a greedy approach to construct the largest number with the maximum sum of digits. We start from the most significant digit and try to maximize it, then move to the next digit, and so on. This approach ensures that we find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits in an efficient manner. 

Here's a revised version of the program in python that uses this approach:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x_str = str(x)
    max_num = 0
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(x_str), 0, -1):
        for j in range(9, -1, -1):
            num_str = str(j) + '9' * (i - 1)
            if int(num_str) <= x:
                digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in num_str))
                if digit_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = digit_sum
                    max_num = int(num_str)
    print(max_num)

func()
```
This revised program has a much better time complexity and can handle large inputs efficiently.
