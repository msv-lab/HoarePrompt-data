Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue lies in the function `func_2(n)`, which is supposed to calculate the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers 1 to `n`, denoted as `f_max(n)`. However, `func_2(n)` simply iterates over numbers from 1 to `n` and calculates the maximum GCD of the previous result and the current number. This approach does not accurately represent the process of finding the maximum `f(p)` for all permutations of 1 to `n`.

For instance, consider the case when `n = 3`. The function `func_2(3)` will calculate `func_1(0, 1)`, `func_1(result, 2)`, and `func_1(result, 3)`, where `result` is the GCD obtained in the previous step. However, this calculation does not take into account the different permutations of the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and how the GCDs of prefixes of these permutations would actually determine `f(p)`.

Additionally, `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates the number of permutations `p` of integers 1 to `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, but it relies on the correctness of `f_max_n` provided by `func_2(n)`. Since `func_2(n)` does not accurately calculate `f_max(n)`, the overall approach is flawed.

The given examples in the problem description, such as when `n = 2` or `n = 3`, suggest that the problem requires a more nuanced understanding of permutations and their prefix GCDs. The code provided does not demonstrate this understanding and thus does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
