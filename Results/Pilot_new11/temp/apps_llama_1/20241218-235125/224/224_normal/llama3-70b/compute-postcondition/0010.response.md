To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`, which means `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`
- `MOD` is `1000000007`
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0`
- `i` is `1`
- `j` is `f_max_n + 1`

Since the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be one less than its current value but still within the loop's range.

However, the current value of `j` is `f_max_n + 1`, which is outside the loop's range. For the loop to have executed at least once, `j` should have started at `f_max_n`. 

Thus, considering the loop's behavior, for it to execute one more time:
- `j` should decrease by 1 from its current valid value within the loop's range, but since it starts at `f_max_n`, we adjust our understanding to consider its value at the start of a new iteration.
- Given `j` is `f_max_n + 1`, we adjust it to be within the loop's range, meaning it should start at `f_max_n` for the first iteration. For the next iteration, it should be `f_max_n - 1`.

Considering the next iteration after `j` has been `f_max_n`, for the loop to execute again:
- `n` remains the same as it's not affected by the loop.
- `f_max_n` remains the same as it's not affected by the loop.
- `MOD` remains the same as it's not affected by the loop.
- `dp` remains the same as its state isn't directly affected by the loop iteration in the given context.
- `i` remains `1` as it's not affected by the loop.
- `j` should be `f_max_n - 1` for the loop to execute again, since it decrements by 1 in each iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
