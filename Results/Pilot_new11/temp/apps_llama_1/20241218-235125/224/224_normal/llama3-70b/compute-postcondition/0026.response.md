According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `f_max_n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is initialized to 2, but the loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to 1, `j` should be adjusted to `f_max_n` for the loop to start executing. Also, since the loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1, `f_max_n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where each `dp[j]` (for `j > 0`) is the result of a cumulative sum process starting from the initial Fibonacci-like sequence, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n`**
