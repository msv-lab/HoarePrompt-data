Functionality: **The function `func_3` calculates the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1`, where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the previous elements, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. It accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and `10^6`, and `f_max_n`, the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers 1 to `n`. After executing the function, the program returns the value of `dp` at index `f_max_n`, effectively providing the result of the cumulative sum process. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input parameters are within the specified range. The function also does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is not a valid maximum value for the given `n`, or where the calculation of `dp` results in an overflow. The final state of the program is that it returns a single integer value, which is the result of the cumulative sum calculation, and does not modify any external state.**
