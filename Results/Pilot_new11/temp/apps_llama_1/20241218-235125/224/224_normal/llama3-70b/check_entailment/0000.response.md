Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not accurately calculate the number of permutations that achieve the maximum value of `f(p)`. 

One issue with the program is that it attempts to find `f_max_n` using `func_2(n)`, which does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of `f(p)` for a given `n`. Instead, `f_max_n` is equal to the number of distinct prime powers less than or equal to `n`, which can be found using a different approach.

Furthermore, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations that achieve `f_max_n`, but this approach is also incorrect. The correct approach involves counting the number of permutations of the numbers `1` to `n` that have the maximum possible number of distinct greatest common divisors.

For example, when `n = 6`, the maximum value `f_max_n` is `3` (since the numbers `2`, `3`, and `6` have the greatest common divisors `2`, `3`, and `1` respectively). However, the program does not correctly count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value.

A correct solution would involve finding all prime powers less than or equal to `n`, then counting the number of permutations of the numbers `1` to `n` that have these prime powers as the greatest common divisors of their prefixes.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
```
6
```
The program's output will be incorrect, because it does not correctly calculate `f_max_n` or count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. The correct output should be `120`, which is the number of permutations of the numbers `1` to `6` that have `3` distinct greatest common divisors. 

In this case, the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` have the greatest common divisors `1`, `2`, `1`, `2`, `5`, and `1` respectively, and all `6! = 720` permutations of these numbers have `3` distinct greatest common divisors, but only `5! = 120` permutations have `1`, `2`, `3` as the greatest common divisors. 

However, the program does not correctly distinguish between these two cases, and therefore produces an incorrect output.
