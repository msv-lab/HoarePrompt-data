According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be an integer greater than 1, the loop can execute. The loop starts from `i = 2`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be 2 at the start of the loop. The variables `mod` and `result` are not directly related to the loop execution, but their states should still be included in the final state description.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
