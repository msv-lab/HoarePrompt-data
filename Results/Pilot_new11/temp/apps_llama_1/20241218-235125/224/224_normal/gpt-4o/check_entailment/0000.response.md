Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

The issue lies in the fact that the function `func_1(n, mod)` simply calculates the factorial of `n`, which does not take into account the condition that $f(p)$ should be equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

For example, when $n = 3$, the program returns $2! = 2$, which is incorrect. The correct answer is $4$, as shown in the problem description.

The program does not consider the fact that $f_{max}(n)$ is the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$. It simply returns the factorial of $n-1$ for $n > 2$, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, and then count the number of permutations $p$ such that $f(p)$ is equal to this maximum value. This requires a more complex approach than simply calculating the factorial of $n-1$. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
