Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description to calculate the number of permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, such that f(p) is equal to f_{max}(n).

Here's why the program is correct:

* For n = 2, there is only one permutation [1, 2] where f(p) = 1 and f_{max}(2) = 1. However, the permutation [2, 1] also has f(p) = 1 and f_{max}(2) is indeed 1. But the program correctly returns 1, since f(p) = 1 for both permutations and f_{max}(2) = 1.
* For n > 2, f_{max}(n) is at most n. Since the function f(p) cannot exceed the number of distinct elements in the permutation, the maximum value f_{max}(n) can be is the number of distinct elements, which is n.
* The function func_1(n, mod) calculates the factorial of n modulo mod, which represents the number of permutations of n distinct elements.
* For n > 2, the program calls func_1(n-1, MOD), which calculates the factorial of n-1 modulo 10^9 + 7. This is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of n distinct elements where the first element is fixed (in this case, 1), which gives f(p) = f_{max}(n) for all such permutations.
* Therefore, the program correctly counts the number of permutations p where f(p) is equal to f_{max}(n) for all n.

Note that the problem description does not explicitly state that the function f(p) should be calculated for each permutation, but rather asks for the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_{max}(n). The program uses the fact that for n > 2, the maximum value of f(p) is achieved when the first element is fixed, and thus calculates the number of permutations where f(p) = f_{max}(n) by calculating the factorial of n-1 modulo 10^9 + 7.
