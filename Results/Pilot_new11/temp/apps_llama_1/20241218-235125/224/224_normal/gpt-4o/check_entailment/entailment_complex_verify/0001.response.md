Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code provided does not correctly solve the problem described. 

The problem requires finding the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$, where $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of prefixes of $p$, and $f_{max}(n)$ is the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$. 

However, the provided code simply calculates the factorial of $n-1$ modulo $10^9+7$ for $n > 2$, which does not relate to the problem description. The code does not calculate $f(p)$ for each permutation $p$, nor does it find the maximum value $f_{max}(n)$ of $f(p)$ among all permutations.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(n, mod)` calculates the factorial of $n$ modulo $mod$, which further supports the original assessment that the code does not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the code is not correct.

Final: **False**
