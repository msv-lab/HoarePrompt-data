`col` is assigned the value `m - remaining_steps`, where `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, the number of `full_rows` is odd, and `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows`, the number of `full_rows` is odd, and `col` is `m - remaining_steps` which equals `m - (k % (m - 1))`.
Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows`, the number of `full_rows` is odd, and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.**
