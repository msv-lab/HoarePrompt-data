Postcondition: **`n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, and `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is an even positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.**
