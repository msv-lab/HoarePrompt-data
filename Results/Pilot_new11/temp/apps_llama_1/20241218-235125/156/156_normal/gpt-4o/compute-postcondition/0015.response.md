The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, with the additional constraint that `n` is even. `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`*`m`. 

However, the specific output or return value of the function `func_1` based on these inputs is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` can only be described in terms of the parameters it accepts and the constraints on those parameters, without detailing what it returns.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.**
