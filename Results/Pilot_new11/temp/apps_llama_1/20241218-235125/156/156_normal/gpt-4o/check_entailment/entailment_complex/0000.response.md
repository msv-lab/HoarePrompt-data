Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. It accurately calculates Lara's current position after she moves `k` times.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The program first checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`, which means Lara has not yet reached the bottom left corner of the matrix. If this is the case, it prints `k + 1` and `1`, indicating Lara's position.

2. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, it means Lara has reached the bottom left corner and is now moving in a snake-like pattern. The program calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`.

3. It then determines the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `m - remaining_steps`.

This logic accurately follows Lara's movement pattern as described in the problem description:

- Lara starts at position `(1, 1)` and moves down to position `(n, 1)`.
- Then, she moves right to column `2`, up to row `n - 1`, left to column `1`, and then up to row `n - 2`. This pattern continues.
- The program's calculation of `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` correctly accounts for this pattern.
- The determination of the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd also accurately reflects Lara's movement pattern.

Overall, the program correctly calculates Lara's position after she moves `k` times, following the problem description's requirements.
