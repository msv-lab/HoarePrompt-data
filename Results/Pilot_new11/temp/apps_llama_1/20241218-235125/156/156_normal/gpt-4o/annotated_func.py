#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, and `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is an even positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m. If k is less than n - 1, then the function returns k + 1. Otherwise, the function calculates full_rows as the integer division of k by m - 1, and remaining_steps as k modulo m - 1. Then, it determines row and col based on whether full_rows is even or odd: if full_rows is even, row is n - full_rows and col is 2 + remaining_steps; if full_rows is odd, row is n - full_rows and col is m - (k % (m - 1)). The values of row and col are returned as output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints two values: if `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`; otherwise, it calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then determines a row and column (`row` and `col`) based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - remaining_steps`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `m`, or `k`, and it does not handle any potential edge cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` may not meet the specified conditions. The function only performs printing actions and does not return any values, contrary to the annotations which suggest that it returns `row` and `col`. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that two values have been printed to the console, and the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
