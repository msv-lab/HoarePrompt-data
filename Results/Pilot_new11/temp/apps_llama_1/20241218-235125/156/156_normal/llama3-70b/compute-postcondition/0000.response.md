The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into three parts, converts them to integers, and assigns the values to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. 

The previous values of `n` and `m` being positive integers with `n` being even, and `k` being a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m` are overwritten by the new input values.

The new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers**
