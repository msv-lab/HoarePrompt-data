Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)` and is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, then two values have been printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which cycles through a range determined by `n`, and the second is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which is either 1 or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then the values 1 and 2 have been printed.**
