The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, with `n` being even. `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. After executing the function body, the return value is not specified in the provided output. To accurately describe the functionality, the return value must be provided.


However, given the format and previous examples, I'll create a general description based on typical patterns, but please note that the exact return behavior is unknown without more specific output details.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, but the return value is not specified.**
