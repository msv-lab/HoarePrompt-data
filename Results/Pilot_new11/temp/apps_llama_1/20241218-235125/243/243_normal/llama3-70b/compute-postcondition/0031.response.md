The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial state of the variables remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `count` is a finite value, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is [1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
