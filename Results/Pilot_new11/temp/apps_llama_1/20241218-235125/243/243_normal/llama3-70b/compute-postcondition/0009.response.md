The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside of. Since there's no explicit loop or conditional statement in the given snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
