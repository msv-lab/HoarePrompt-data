According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop. This means that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely, regardless of the state of the variables. 

Since it's a `while True` loop, no conditions need to be met for the loop to execute again, so no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 2, `count` is a finite value, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is [1]**
