The input is converted to an integer and assigned to `m`. The value of `m` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ `m` â‰¤ 100 000, representing the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a positive integer `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is the value of `m` is an input integer between 1 and 100 000, and `m` represents the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100 000, and `m` represents the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a positive integer `n`.**
