Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the program is running. There are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is the previous value of `count` plus 1**
