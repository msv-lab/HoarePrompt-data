Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes, but the program calculates the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with at least `m` zeroes.

For example, given the input `m = 1`, the program should output the number of integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly 1 zero. However, the program will output the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`, which are the integers `n` such that `n!` ends with at least 1 zero.

A correct program would need to find the integers `n` that have exactly `m` trailing zeroes in their factorial, not at least `m`. This requires a different approach, such as calculating the number of factors of 5 in each factorial and comparing it to `m`.

In the given code, the logic for calculating the count of integers `n` and the loop that generates the sequence of these integers do not align with the problem's requirement for exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The code's objective, as described, is not accurately reflected in its implementation. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its Correctness is **False**.
