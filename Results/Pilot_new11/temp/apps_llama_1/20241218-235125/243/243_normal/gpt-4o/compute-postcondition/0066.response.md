To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid`.

The loop condition `func_1(left) == m` must be satisfied for the loop to execute at least once. This means that the value of `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. Since `left` is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is derived from `low` and `high`, for the loop to execute, `func_1(mid)` (or equivalently `func_1(left)`) must equal `m`.

Given that `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, for the loop to execute, `zeroes` must also equal `m`. This implies that the state of `zeroes` (and consequently the state of `func_1(mid)` or `func_1(left)`) needs to be such that it equals `m` for the loop condition to be met.

No adjustments are needed to `m`, `low`, `high`, `result` directly based on the loop condition, as the critical factor is the relationship between `func_1(left)` (or `zeroes`) and `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time, considering the given loop condition, is:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid`**
