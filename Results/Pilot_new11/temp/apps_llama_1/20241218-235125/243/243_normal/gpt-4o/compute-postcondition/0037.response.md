The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, but since `high` is being updated, we need to consider the previous value of `high`. However, we can still express `mid` in terms of `low` and the new `high`. 

Given that `high` becomes `mid - 1` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute `mid` in the equation for the new `high`:
`high` becomes `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. 

To simplify, let's denote the original `high` as `original_high`. Then `mid` is `(low + original_high) // 2`. After updating `high`, it becomes `(low + original_high) // 2 - 1`.

However, the code does not update `mid` or `low`, it only updates `high`. So, `mid` remains `(low + original_high) // 2`, but now `high` is `mid - 1`, which means `high` is `(low + original_high) // 2 - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` must be less than or equal to the new `high`, `mid` is `(low + original_high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + original_high) // 2)`, and `high` is `(low + original_high) // 2 - 1` which simplifies to `high` is `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high + 1) // 2)`, and `high` is `mid - 1`.**
