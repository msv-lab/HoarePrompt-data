To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
2. **Iteration Effect**: In each iteration, `left` is decremented by 1.
3. **Initial Conditions**: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the result of `func_1` applied to `mid`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` starts as `(low + high) // 2`.

Given the loop condition and effect, the loop will continue to decrement `left` as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. This means the loop will stop when `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, which could happen if `left` reaches a value where `func_1(left)` returns a different value or if `left` goes out of a valid range for `func_1`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:
- `m` remains constant throughout.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and `result` do not change within the loop.
- `left` decreases by 1 with each iteration.

The key here is understanding that the loop will stop when `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` anymore. This could be due to `left` becoming too small or because `func_1(left)` actually changes value.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
- `m` remains the same positive integer.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and `result` remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop.
- `left` will be the first value (starting from `(low + high) // 2` and decrementing) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, or it will continue to decrement until it reaches a boundary condition that stops the loop, which could be related to the domain of `func_1` or an explicit boundary check not shown in the provided code.

Given the information provided and focusing on the format requested:
Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, assuming `func_1(left)` and the loop's stopping condition are solely dependent on `func_1(left)` equaling `m`.**
