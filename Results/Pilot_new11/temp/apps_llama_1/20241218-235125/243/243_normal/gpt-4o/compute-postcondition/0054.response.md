To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
while func_1(right) == m:
    right += 1
```
From the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can observe that:

* `m` is unchanged
* `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
* `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`
* `low` and `high` are unchanged
* `result` is an empty list `[]`
* `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
* `right` is incremented by 1 in each iteration

The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. The loop will terminate when `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

After the loop has finished executing, the value of `right` will be the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Since the loop only increments `right` and does not modify any other variables, the output state of the loop will be:

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
