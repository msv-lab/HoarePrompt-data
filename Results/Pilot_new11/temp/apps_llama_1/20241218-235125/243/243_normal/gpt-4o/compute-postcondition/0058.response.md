Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` (the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`) is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` (where `mid` refers to the original calculation). If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then either `high` is updated to `mid - 1` (where `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`), or `m` remains unchanged, `mid` remains `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, and a result is generated as a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.***
