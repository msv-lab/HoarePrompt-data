To determine the output state after the given code is executed, we'll follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

1. **Initial State**: We are given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.

2. **Code Execution**: The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. This means the lower bound of the range is now shifted to the right by one unit from `mid`.

3. **Output State Calculation**: 
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
   - The new value of `low` is `mid + 1`.
   - `high` remains unchanged as there is no operation performed on it.
   - `mid` is still the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, but since `low` has changed, if `mid` were to be recalculated based on the new `low`, it would be different. However, the code does not explicitly recalculate `mid`, so `mid` itself remains the integer part of the original `(low + high) / 2` before `low` was updated.
   - `zeroes` is still equal to `func_1(mid)`, but since `mid` itself hasn't been updated in this step (only `low` has been updated), `zeroes` remains as it was.

Given these considerations, the output state after executing the code is that `m` is still a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is now `mid + 1`, `high` remains greater than or equal to the new `low`, `mid` is the original integer part of `(low + high) / 2` before `low` was updated, and `zeroes` equals `func_1(mid)` based on the original `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is the integer part of the original `(low + high) / 2`, and `zeroes` equals `func_1(mid)`**
