The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Given that `left` was initially `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, its new value will be `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 2`**
