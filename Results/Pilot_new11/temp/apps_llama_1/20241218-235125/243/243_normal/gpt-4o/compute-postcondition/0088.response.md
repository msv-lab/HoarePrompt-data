Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts a single parameter, a positive integer m between 1 and 100,000, and returns a list of integers. The returned list represents the range of values for which the function func_1 returns exactly m trailing zeroes when calculating the factorial of a number. If no such range exists, the function returns an empty list. The function iteratively searches for the range of values that satisfy this condition using a binary search approach and then expands around the found value to determine the exact range. After execution, the function's state is reset, with the only lasting result being the returned list of integers or an empty list if no matching range is found. The function does not modify the input parameter m and does not have any side effects. The returned list includes all integers from the first value greater than the lower boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) plus one, to the last value less than the upper boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) minus one. The function handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list.**
