To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. 

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 3`.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. Given that `right` is `mid + 3`, we need to ensure that the condition `func_1(mid + 3) == m` holds true.

Since we do not have specific information about how `func_1` behaves with different inputs, we cannot directly infer how `right` (or `mid`) should be adjusted based solely on the function's behavior. However, we know that `right` needs to be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state and the requirement for the next iteration, we should note that:

- The relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` suggests a binary search context, but this does not directly affect the `while` loop's condition.
- `left` being the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` implies that for values less than or equal to `mid`, `func_1` does not equal `m`, but this does not provide direct insight into adjusting `right` or `mid`.
- `zeroes` equals `m`, and `result` is an empty list, but these do not directly influence the loop condition.

The critical point is ensuring `func_1(right) == m`. Given `right` is defined as `mid + 3`, and without specific knowledge of `func_1`'s behavior, we must ensure that the scenario allows for `func_1` of some value (in this case, `right`) to equal `m`. Thus, the state adjustments should focus on maintaining the possibility of `func_1(right)` equaling `m` without contradicting the given conditions.

**State:** **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 3` with the understanding that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.**
