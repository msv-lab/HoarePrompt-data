The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` updates the value of `result`. 

The original value of `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and the original value of `right` is the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

`result` now becomes a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
