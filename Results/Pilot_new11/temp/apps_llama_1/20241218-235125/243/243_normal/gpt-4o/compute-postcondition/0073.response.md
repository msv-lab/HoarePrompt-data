The code `right = mid + 1` updates the value of `right` to be one more than the current value of `mid`. 

The value of `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1`**
