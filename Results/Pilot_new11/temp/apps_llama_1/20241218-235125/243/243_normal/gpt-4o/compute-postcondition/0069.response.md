The value of `left` is decreased by 1, where `left` is initially equal to `mid - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and `left` is initially `mid - 1`, then after the code is executed, `left` becomes `mid - 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 2`**
