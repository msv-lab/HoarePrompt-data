The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid`.
