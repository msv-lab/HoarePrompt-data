Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of the original `(low + high) / 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` < `m`, then `low` is `mid + 1`. If `zeroes` ≥ `m`, then either `high` is `mid - 1` when `zeroes` > `m`, or `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `right` is the first value greater than the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the original value of `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, when `zeroes` equals `m`.**
