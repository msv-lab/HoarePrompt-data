To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State**: Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the problem statement, so we will treat its output as a given condition that either matches `m` or does not.

3. **Loop Execution**: 
   - After the loop executes once, `left` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`.
   - After the loop executes twice, `left` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 2`.
   - This pattern indicates that `left` decreases by 1 with each iteration.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we can infer that the loop will stop when the condition `func_1(left) == m` is not met. This implies that `left` will continue to decrease until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `m` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `low` remains `0` as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)` as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `result` remains an empty list as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `mid` remains `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2` as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `zeroes` remains equal to `m` as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `left` will be the value that causes `func_1(left)` to not equal `m` for the first time, which means it will be one less than the smallest value for which `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Given the pattern and the fact that the loop control variable `left` decreases with each iteration, the output state after all iterations can be described in terms of the original and current values of the variables, especially focusing on how `left` changes.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, and `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.**
