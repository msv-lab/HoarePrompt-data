To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(left) == m:`.

1. The condition for the loop to execute again depends solely on the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`.
2. Since `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` and `zeroes` must equal `m`, we can infer that `m` and `zeroes` have a fixed value within this range.
3. The value of `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 2`, which means its value depends on `low` and `high`.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. This implies that the critical factor is the relationship between `left` and `m`, given that `func_1(left)` needs to output `m`.

Given that we do not know the specifics of `func_1`, we must ensure that `left` can lead to a situation where `func_1(left)` equals `m` again. Since we don't have the specifics of how `func_1` operates, we cannot directly infer how to adjust `left` without knowing more about the function's behavior. However, we can consider the constraints given:

- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `zeroes` must equal `m`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`, but this does not directly affect the loop condition.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, which could influence `left` indirectly through its calculation.

Since the loop's continuation depends on `func_1(left) == m`, and we know `left` is calculated based on `low` and `high`, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that the conditions under which `func_1(left)` equals `m` can be met again. This means we should consider how `left` is generated and how it relates to `m`.

However, given the information and without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, the most direct inference we can make is about maintaining the potential for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` by considering the range and constraints of the variables involved, especially `m`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and consequently, `left`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` can equal `m`**
