According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left` and the function `func_1(left)`. If `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which means its value is already determined based on `m`. However, there is no guarantee that `func_1(left)` equals `m` based solely on the given state, as the behavior of `func_1` is not defined.

Since `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, and `left` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, for the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Without knowing the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine how `left` or `m` needs to be adjusted to ensure `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 

However, based on the information given, we can repeat the program state right before the loop because we cannot make any adjustments without knowing the behavior of `func_1`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`**
