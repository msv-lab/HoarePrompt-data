To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m:`. This means for the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration.

Given states:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
- `zeroes` must equal `m`
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `result` is an empty list `[]`
- `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`

The key variable in the loop condition is `left`, which is used in `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute again, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true.

Since `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and is directly used in the loop condition, we must ensure that any change to `low` or `high` does not violate the condition that allows the loop to continue, i.e., `func_1(left)` must remain equal to `m`.

However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we cannot directly infer how `left` should be adjusted to maintain the loop condition. We can only ensure that the relationship between `left`, `low`, and `high` is preserved in a way that could potentially allow `func_1(left)` to equal `m` again.

Given the initial setup and the goal to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the critical aspect is that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Since `zeroes` must equal `m` and is not directly involved in the loop condition, and `result` is an empty list which doesn't affect the loop condition, we focus on `left` and its relationship to `m`.

The state of `mid`, `low`, and `high` is less directly relevant since the loop condition specifically depends on `func_1(left)` equals `m`, not the values of `mid`, `low`, or `high` themselves. However, since `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, the range defined by `low` and `high` must be such that it allows for a `left` value that could satisfy `func_1(left) == m`.

Thus, without explicit details on `func_1`, we ensure that the potential for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` is maintained, which means `left` must be in a state that could logically lead to `func_1(left)` equals `m`, given the constraints on `m`, `zeroes`, and the relationships between `low`, `high`, and `mid`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1` with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.**
