To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. Given that `right` is `mid + 2` and `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` where `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which this condition is false, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` continues to equal `m`.

Since `right` is `mid + 2`, and we know that `left` (the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`) does not satisfy the condition, we must adjust the state so that `func_1(mid + 2)` (which is `func_1(right)`) still equals `m`. This implies that the values of `mid` and consequently `right` should be such that the function `func_1` at `right` (or `mid + 2`) should yield `m`.

There's no direct constraint on `m` itself that needs adjustment since it's given as a constant positive integer within a range. The crucial part is the relationship between `mid`, `right`, and the function `func_1`. Given that `zeroes` equals `m`, and `result` is an empty list, these do not directly influence the loop condition but describe the state at the end of the previous iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it's essential that `func_1(right)` still returns `m`. Since `right` is defined as `mid + 2`, and we are considering the scenario right after the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the condition for the loop to continue is met without explicitly changing the function's behavior or the values of `m` and `right` directly. 

Therefore, the adjustment needs to focus on ensuring that the loop condition can still be met given the current state of variables. Since `right` is `mid + 2`, and we know `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, the condition for `func_1(right) == m` to hold true after the iteration suggests that the state should be adjusted so that `right` (or `mid + 2`) still falls within the range where `func_1` of that value equals `m`.

However, the description already implies that `right` (being `mid + 2`) is in a position where `func_1(right)` could potentially equal `m`, given that `left` (the first non-matching value) is less than or equal to `mid`. Thus, the given states (`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 2`) inherently suggest a scenario where the loop condition could be met again if `func_1(right)` indeed equals `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
