To determine the output state, let's examine the given initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid`.

Code Snippet:
```python
left -= 1
```

The impact of this code on the program is that it decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given that `left` was initially equal to `mid`, after the execution of this code, `left` will be equal to `mid - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is still equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and the relationship between `low` and `high` does not change.

Therefore, considering the change in `left`, the output state is:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
