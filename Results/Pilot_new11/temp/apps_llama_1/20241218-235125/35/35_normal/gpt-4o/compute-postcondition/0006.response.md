The value of `high` is updated to `mid`, which is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`, `low` is 1, `high` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. Additionally, it is not possible to distribute the cakes with `mid` pieces, i.e., `can_distribute(mid)` is False.**
