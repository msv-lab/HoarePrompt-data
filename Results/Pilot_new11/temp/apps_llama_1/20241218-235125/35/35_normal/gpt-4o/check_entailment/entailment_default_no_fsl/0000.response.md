Correctness: **False**

The code provided seems to be on the right track but has a couple of issues. The main issue lies in the function `can_distribute(x)` which is missing parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`. The function should take these parameters to check if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from two cakes is greater than or equal to a given non-negative integer `n`.

Another issue is with the logic of the `can_distribute(x)` function. It should check if there exists a way to distribute `a` and `b` pieces into `n` plates with at least `x` pieces per plate. However, the current implementation does not guarantee that each plate will have pieces of only one cake. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to modify the `can_distribute(x)` function to correctly check all possible distributions of `a` and `b` pieces into `n` plates with at least `x` pieces per plate.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

For input `n = 5, a = 3, b = 7`, the program may not correctly calculate the maximum possible number `x` such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions. This is because the `can_distribute(x)` function is not correctly implemented. 

A correct implementation would need to consider all possible distributions of `a` and `b` pieces into `n` plates, ensuring that each plate contains at least `x` pieces and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

Without correct implementation of `can_distribute(x)` function and the binary search logic in `func_1(n, a, b)`, the program cannot guarantee the correct output for every potential case. 

Here is the correct code for the functions:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    def can_distribute(x, n, a, b):
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i * x <= a and (n - i) * x <= b:
                return True
        return False

    low, high = 1, max(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid, n, a, b):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))
```
