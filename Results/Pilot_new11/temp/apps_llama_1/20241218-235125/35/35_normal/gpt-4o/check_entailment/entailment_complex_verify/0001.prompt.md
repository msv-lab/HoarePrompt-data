You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is not following the problem description correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the `can_distribute` function is implemented. This function checks if it's possible to distribute `a` and `b` pieces of cake into plates with at least `x` pieces, but it does not check if the remaining pieces can be distributed into the remaining plates.

For example, consider the input `n = 5, a = 3, b = 4`. The `can_distribute` function will return `True` for `x = 1`, but it's not possible to distribute the cake pieces such that each plate has at least `1` piece and no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

A correct implementation would need to check all possible ways of distributing the cake pieces into plates and ensure that the conditions are met.

Another issue is that the program does not define the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` in the `can_distribute` function, which would cause a `NameError` when trying to run the program. 

The `can_distribute` function should be modified to correctly check if the cake pieces can be distributed into plates with at least `x` pieces, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` should be passed as arguments to this function. 

Here is an example of how the `can_distribute` function could be modified:

```python
def can_distribute(n, a, b, x):
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if a >= i * x and b >= (n - i) * x:
            return True
    return False

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(n, a, b, mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, a is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `low` equals `high`, and `low` represents the smallest number of pieces per plate for which `can_distribute` starts to consistently return True, or the point of transition regarding distribution possibility, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their original meanings related to the number of plates and pieces of cakes.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns the number of pieces per plate that is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate for which distribution is consistently possible, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their original meanings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum number of pieces per plate that can be distributed among 'n' plates when there are 'a' pieces of the first cake and 'b' pieces of the second cake available, such that it is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate at which the distribution becomes consistently possible. The function assumes that 'n' is a positive integer representing the number of plates, and 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing the number of pieces of each cake, where the total number of pieces ('a + b') is enough to fill at least 'n' plates with at least 2 pieces each. The function relies on the external function 'can_distribute' to determine the possibility of distributing the cakes with a given number of pieces per plate. The return value represents the point just before the distribution becomes feasible with the given number of plates and cakes, taking into account the binary search logic performed within the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the two cakes, n is a non-negative integer representing the number of plates, and x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces per plate.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least x pieces from cakes a and b is greater than or equal to n, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute(x)` checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from two cakes, represented by the positive integers `a` and `b`, is greater than or equal to a given non-negative integer `n`. It returns `True` if this condition is met and `False` otherwise. However, the function seems to be missing parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are crucial for its operation as described in the annotations. Despite this, the code provided only takes `x` as a parameter, suggesting a potential discrepancy between the intended functionality and the actual implementation. The function's purpose appears to be determining the feasibility of distributing cake pieces into a specified number of plates with a minimum number of pieces per plate, but the actual implementation only considers the distribution based on the provided `x` and implicitly defined `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are not explicitly passed to the function.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
