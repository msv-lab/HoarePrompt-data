Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1(n, a, b)` is attempting to use a binary search approach to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. However, the function `can_distribute(x)` is checking if the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, which is not the correct condition.

The correct condition should be that the number of plates with pieces of the first cake plus the number of plates with pieces of the second cake should be equal to `n`, and each plate should have at least `x` pieces of cake. 

A case that demonstrates the program's incorrectness is when `n = 4`, `a = 7`, and `b = 10`. The program returns `3` as the maximum possible number `x`, but the actual maximum possible number `x` is indeed `3` because two plates can have `3` and `4` pieces of the first cake, and two plates can have `5` pieces of the second cake. However, if we slightly modify the input to `n = 4`, `a = 8`, and `b = 9`, the program would incorrectly return `2` as the maximum possible number `x` because it does not take into account the fact that the number of plates with pieces of the first cake plus the number of plates with pieces of the second cake should be equal to `n`. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should find the maximum value of `x` such that `a` can be divided into at most `n` parts of size at least `x` and `b` can also be divided into at most `n` parts of size at least `x`. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    def can_distribute(x):
        a_plates = (a + x - 1) // x
        b_plates = (b + x - 1) // x
        return a_plates + b_plates <= n

    low, high = 1, max(a, b)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return low
```
