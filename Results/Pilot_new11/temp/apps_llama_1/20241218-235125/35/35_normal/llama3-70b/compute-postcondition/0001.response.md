The code `x = min(n, a, b)` assigns the smallest value among `n`, `a`, and `b` to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers determined by the user's input, with potential constraints of 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, although these constraints may not hold depending on the input.

Given this, the output state will reflect the assignment of the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` to `x`, while `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values determined by the user's input, potentially adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
