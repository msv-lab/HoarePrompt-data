It appears there's an issue with the provided problem statement. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which indicates it doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers with specific bounds. 

Given the constraints and assuming the function should actually accept these parameters (let's correct the function definition to `def func(n, a, b):`), we proceed as follows:

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`.

Since the specific output conditions (like the return values based on the input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`) are not provided, we cannot detail the return values or specific conditions for different cases. 

However, adhering to the required format and based on the information provided:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are integers with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, but the specific return values or conditions are not defined.**
