Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values determined by the user's input, potentially adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`. The current values of `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the differences between `a` and `x` and between `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
