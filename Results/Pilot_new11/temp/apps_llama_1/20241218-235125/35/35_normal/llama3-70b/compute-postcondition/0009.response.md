Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values determined by the user's input, potentially adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x` and `b` is greater than or equal to `x` and the sum of the differences between `a` and `x` and between `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
