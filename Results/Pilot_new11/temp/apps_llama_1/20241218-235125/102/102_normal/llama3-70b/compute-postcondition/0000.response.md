The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` is overwritten. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code. 

The input to `n` can be any integer, but the initial state restricts the original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to be between 1 and 10,000,000. However, the new value of `n` can be any integer value based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10,000,000**
