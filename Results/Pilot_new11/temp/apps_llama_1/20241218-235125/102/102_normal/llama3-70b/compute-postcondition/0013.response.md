To determine the output state, let's analyze the code step by step. The given code snippet is `print(x, y)`. 

1. `x` is 1.
2. `y` is `(n - a) // b`, where `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, and `b` is an input integer.
3. 'YES' has been printed.

The `print(x, y)` statement does not change the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It only outputs the current values of `x` and `y` to the console. 

Given this, the output state remains the same in terms of variable assignments, but we must note that `x` and `y` have been printed. The value of `y` is dependent on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are input integers, but since `x` is a constant 1, and `y` is a calculated value based on inputs, we keep these relationships in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.**
