The function determines whether a given integer `n` can be expressed as a linear combination of two other integers `a` and `b`, i.e., whether there exist integers `x` and `y` such that `n = x * a + y * b`. It accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 10,000,000`, `1 <= a <= 10,000,000`, and `1 <= b <= 10,000,000`. The function then checks all possible integer values of `x` and corresponding `y` to see if the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true. If such integers `x` and `y` are found, the function prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no such integers are found after checking all possibilities, the function prints 'NO'. After execution, the program's state is either 'YES' printed with the appropriate `x` and `y` values or 'NO', indicating whether `n` can be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`. The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like `a` or `b` being zero, but since the input constraints specify both `a` and `b` as greater than or equal to 1, these cases are implicitly excluded. The actual return value of the function is implicitly `None` since it does not explicitly return any value, but its primary output is the print statements indicating whether `n` can be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.
