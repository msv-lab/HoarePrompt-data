The given code snippet prints 'YES' to the console, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' has been printed**
