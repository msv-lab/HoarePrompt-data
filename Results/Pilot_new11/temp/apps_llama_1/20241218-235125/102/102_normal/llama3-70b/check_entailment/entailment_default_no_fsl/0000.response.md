Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It checks all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to see if the total cost equals the amount of money Vasya has. The program correctly handles all cases, including when it is possible to spend exactly n burles and when it is not.

The program's logic is sound, as it iterates over all possible values of x (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and calculates the corresponding value of y (the number of Bars bars) to check if the equation x * a + y * b equals n. If it finds a combination that satisfies the equation, it prints 'YES' along with the values of x and y. If it checks all possible combinations without finding a match, it prints 'NO'.

All the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. For instance, when the input is 7, 2, and 3, the program correctly outputs 'YES' with x = 2 and y = 1, as 2 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 7. Similarly, for the input 100, 25, and 10, the program outputs 'YES' with x = 0 and y = 10, as 0 * 25 + 10 * 10 = 100. The case where it is impossible to spend exactly n burles, such as the input 15, 4, and 8, is also correctly handled, with the program outputting 'NO'.

The program's assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., positive integers for n, a, and b) does not affect its correctness, as the problem description guarantees that the input will be within the specified ranges. 

Therefore, the program is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
