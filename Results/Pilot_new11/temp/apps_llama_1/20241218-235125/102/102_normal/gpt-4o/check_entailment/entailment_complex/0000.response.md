Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It determines whether it's possible to spend a given amount of money on two items with specific costs, and if so, finds the number of each item that can be bought.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The program reads the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly, which represent the amount of money and the costs of the two items, respectively.

2. It iterates over all possible combinations of buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola, where `x` ranges from 0 to `n // a` (the maximum number of bottles that can be bought with the available money). For each `x`, it checks whether the remaining money (`n - x * a`) can be spent on buying `y` Bars bars.

3. If it finds a combination where `n - x * a` is exactly divisible by `b` (i.e., `y = (n - x * a) // b` is an integer), it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and returns. This ensures that the program stops as soon as it finds a valid solution.

4. If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to spend the given amount of money on the two items.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the amount of money is not enough to buy at least one item.
* When the costs of the items are such that no combination can sum up to the given amount of money.
* When there are multiple valid solutions (it prints any one of them).

Since the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, its correctness is **True**.
