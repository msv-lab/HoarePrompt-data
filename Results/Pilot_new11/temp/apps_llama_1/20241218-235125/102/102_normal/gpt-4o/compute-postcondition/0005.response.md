The value of `y` is calculated as the integer division of `n - x * a` by `b`. Given that `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `n // b`. Since `n` is a multiple of `b` (as `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b` and `x` is 0), `y` will be an integer representing how many times `b` fits into `n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an input integer, `b` is still an input integer, `a` is still a non-zero input integer, `n` is still greater than or equal to `-a`, and `x` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`**
