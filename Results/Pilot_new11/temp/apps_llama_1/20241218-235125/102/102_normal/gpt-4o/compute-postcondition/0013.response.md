The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y` to the console. The value of `x` is 1 and the value of `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1, `(n - a) % b` is not equal to 0, `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1, `(n - a) % b` is not equal to 0, `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed to the console.**
