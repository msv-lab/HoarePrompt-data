The code `print(x, y)` prints the current values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 0 and the value of `y` is `n // b`. 

The values of `n`, `b`, and `a` are still input integers. `n` is still greater than or equal to `-a`. 'YES' has been printed.

The print statement does not change the values of any variables, it simply outputs their current values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.**
