The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not modify any variables.

The states of `n`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation.

The output of the print statement is 'YES', but this does not change the state of the program's variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1, (n - a) % b is not equal to 0, `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
