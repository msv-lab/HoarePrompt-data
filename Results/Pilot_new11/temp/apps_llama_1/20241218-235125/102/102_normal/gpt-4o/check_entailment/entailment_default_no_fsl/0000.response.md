Correctness: **True**

The code provided follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. It checks all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars, ensuring that it can spend exactly n burles. 

The function `func_1` attempts to find non-negative integer values of `x` and `y` such that `x` times the cost of Ber-Cola (`a`) plus `y` times the cost of Bars bars (`b`) equals the given amount of money (`n`). If such values are found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and returns. If no such values are found after checking all possible combinations, it prints "NO" and returns.

The code correctly handles various cases, including scenarios where the amount of money is not enough to buy at least one item, or where the costs of the items are such that no combination can sum up to the given amount of money. This is demonstrated by the provided examples, where the code produces the expected output.

For example, in the case where `n = 7`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code correctly finds that buying 2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar results in spending exactly 7 burles. In the case where `n = 100`, `a = 25`, and `b = 10`, the code finds one of the possible combinations: buying 0 bottles of Ber-Cola and 10 Bars bars.

The code also correctly handles cases where it is impossible to buy Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles, such as when `n = 15`, `a = 4`, and `b = 8`.

Given that the code handles all these cases as described in the problem statement, and does so for the provided examples, it can be concluded that the code is correct for every potential case.
