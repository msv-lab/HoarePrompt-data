According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 4, `s` is the input string of length `n`, `i` is 3**
