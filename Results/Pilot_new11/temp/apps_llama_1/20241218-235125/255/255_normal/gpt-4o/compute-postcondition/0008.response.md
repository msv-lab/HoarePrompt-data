The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was either 1 or 2. Therefore, the new value of `operations` is either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `s` is the input string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `operations` is either 2 or 3**
