The input consists of two lines, the first line contains a positive integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 500), and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. 

`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts the first line as input and `int` converts it to an integer.

The value of `n` becomes the positive integer from the input.

The information about `s` and its length is still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 500), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, waiting to be read from the input.**
