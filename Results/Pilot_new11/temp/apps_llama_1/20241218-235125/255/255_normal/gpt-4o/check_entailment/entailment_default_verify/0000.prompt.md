You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$. The logic is based on the fact that in one operation, a contiguous substring of equal letters can be deleted. Therefore, the program simply counts the number of transitions between different letters in the string, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- It iterates over the string, checking each character against the previous one.
- Whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one, it increments the `operations` counter.
- This effectively counts the number of distinct "blocks" of the same letter in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the string, given that each operation can delete a contiguous block of the same letter.

The initial value of `operations` is set to 1, which accounts for the first block of letters in the string. This ensures that the program correctly counts the number of operations even if the string consists of a single block (i.e., all characters are the same).

For example, given the input string "abaca", the program correctly outputs 3, because it identifies three distinct blocks of letters: "a", "b", and "aca" (where "a" and "ca" are considered as separate blocks due to the intervening "b"). Similarly, for the input string "abcddcba", the program outputs 4, reflecting the four distinct blocks: "a", "b", "cddc", and "b" (again, treating each transition as the start of a new block).

Overall, the program's logic aligns well with the problem description, and it correctly handles the examples provided. Without finding a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input from the user, where the first line is a positive integer `n` and the second line is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calculates the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` and prints this count plus one. The function does not return any value, but instead outputs the result directly to the console. The state of the program after execution will have `n` and `s` stored in memory, with `n` being the length of `s` and the output being the total number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus one, which effectively counts the total number of distinct character sequences or groups in `s`. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format (e.g., non-integer or non-string inputs), and it assumes that the length of the string `s` will always match the integer `n` provided in the first line.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
