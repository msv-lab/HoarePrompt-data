Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `s` is the input string of length `n`, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, then `operations` is 2 and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition, so `operations` is 1 and `i` is 1.***
