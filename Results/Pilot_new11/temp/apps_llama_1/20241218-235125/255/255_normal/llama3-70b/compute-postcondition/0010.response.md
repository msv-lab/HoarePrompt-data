According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` can be 1, 2, or 3**
