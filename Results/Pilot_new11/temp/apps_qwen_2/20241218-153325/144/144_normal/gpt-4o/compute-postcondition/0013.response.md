Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is `n-1`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex` (which is either 3 or 4), no change is made to the list `a`. If `mex` is 2, the function does not change the list `a` as there is no else part.***
