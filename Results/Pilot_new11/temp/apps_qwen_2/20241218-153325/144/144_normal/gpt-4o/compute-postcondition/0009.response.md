`mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` is 2, so after executing `mex += 1`, the value of `mex` becomes 3. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `num`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 3, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`**
