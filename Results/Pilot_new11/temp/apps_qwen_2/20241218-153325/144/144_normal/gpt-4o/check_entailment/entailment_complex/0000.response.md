Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the size of the list.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This step ensures that the elements are in a sequence that allows for easy comparison to find the smallest missing positive integer.

3. **Mex Calculation**:
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `mex`. If so, it increments `mex`.
   - This process continues until the loop completes, ensuring that `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `mex` is printed, which represents the maximum possible value of the mex for the given array.

### Why it is Correct:

- **Correct Initialization**: The `mex` variable starts at 1, which is the smallest positive integer.
- **Iterative Comparison**: By iterating through the sorted list, the program ensures that it correctly identifies the smallest missing positive integer.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program inherently handles edge cases such as:
  - When the list `a` contains only one element.
  - When the list `a` already contains all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Why it is Not Incorrect:

- The program does not require additional error handling for invalid inputs because the problem statement assumes valid input.
- The sorting step ensures that the mex calculation is accurate, even if the input list is not initially sorted.

Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description and performs the required task accurately for all potential cases.
