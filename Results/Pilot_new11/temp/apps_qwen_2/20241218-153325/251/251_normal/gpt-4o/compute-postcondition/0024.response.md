Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is at least 1
   - `j` is 1
   - The condition for `dp[i]` is based on `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`. If this condition is true, `dp[i]` is set to `volumes[i]`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(i)`, meaning the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`, in the next iteration, `j` will start from 0 again.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 2 because if `i` is 1, the range `range(1)` means the loop will not run since the upper limit is exclusive.
   - Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will start from 0 and go up to `i-1`, where `i` is now 2 (since it must be at least 2).

4. **Updated States:**
   - `total` remains 0
   - `i` must be at least 2
   - `j` will start from 0

Thus, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 0**
