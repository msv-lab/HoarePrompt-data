Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples `(r_i, h_i)`, `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) for each cake, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is `volumes[0]`, the second element is `max(0, volumes[2])`, and `i` is 2. If `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then the second element of `dp` is updated to `max(dp[1], dp[0] + volumes[j])`. Otherwise, the second element of `dp` remains unchanged.***
