The code `r, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them by space, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to the variables `r` and `h`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer**
