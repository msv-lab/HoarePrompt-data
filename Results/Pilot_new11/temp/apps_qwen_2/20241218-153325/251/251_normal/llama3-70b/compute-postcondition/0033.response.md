Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is updated to either `cakes[2][0]` or the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j`.***
