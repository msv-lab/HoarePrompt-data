Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`, and for every `k` in the range of `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be any index from `1` to `k`).**

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and runs until `i` reaches `n`.
- `dp[1]` remains unchanged because the loop only updates `dp[i]` for `i > 1`.
- `dp[2]` is initially set to `cakes[2][0]` and can be updated to the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[2][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be 1).
- For each subsequent iteration, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be any index from `1` to `i-1`).

After all iterations, `i` will be `n`, and `dp[k]` for `k` in the range of `1` to `n-1` will contain the maximum value between `max_value_1` and the sum of `cakes[k][0]` plus values from previous `dp[j]` where the conditions `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` are satisfied.
