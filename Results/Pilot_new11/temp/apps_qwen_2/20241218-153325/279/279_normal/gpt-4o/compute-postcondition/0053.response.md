The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. This operation does not change the value of `x` or `p`, but it adds `x` to `cycle`. The state of `visited[p[2] - 1]` being False at the start of the next iteration is a precondition that remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`visited[x]` is True, `visited[p[2] - 1]` is False, `cycle` contains `x`**
