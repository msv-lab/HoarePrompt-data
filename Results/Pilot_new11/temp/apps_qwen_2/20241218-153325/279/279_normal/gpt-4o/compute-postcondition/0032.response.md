`x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. The value of `p[x]` is part of the list `cycle`, which initially is `[1]`. Since `x` is 1, `p[x]` (which is `p[1]`) is 1. Therefore, `x` becomes `1 - 1`, which is `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1], `x` is 0, and `visited[1]` is True**
