Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). If `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle starting from 0 up to the last node visited, `x` is the last node visited before the loop exits, and `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if `visited[0]` is False.**
