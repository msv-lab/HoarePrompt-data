Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle starting from 0 up to the last node visited, `x` is the last node visited before the loop exits**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `visited[0]` is initially set to `False`.
   - `cycle` is an empty list.
   - `x` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `x` is not visited (`not visited[x]`).
   - Each iteration marks `x` as visited (`visited[x] = True`).
   - `x` is added to the `cycle` list.
   - `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when `x` is already marked as visited (`visited[x]` is `True`).

4. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 0 since it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `visited[0]` is set to `True`.
   - `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle starting from 0, including the last node visited before exiting the loop.
   - `x` holds the last node visited before the loop exits.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
