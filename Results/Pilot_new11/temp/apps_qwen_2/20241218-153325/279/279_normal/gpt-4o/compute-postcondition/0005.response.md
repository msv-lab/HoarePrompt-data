The code initializes a list `visited` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `p`, `b`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is in the new variable `visited`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of n integers consisting of the integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `visited` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`.**
