According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be 1. Therefore, `n` can remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**
