Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initially, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1, x]`, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `visited[x]` is True.
2. The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` to `p[x] - 1`.

Since `x` is defined as `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, we substitute this into the code:

- Let's denote `p[0]` as `a`. Therefore, `x` is `p[a - 1] - 1`.
- Substituting `x` in the code, we get `x = p[p[a - 1] - 1] - 1`.

The values of `visited[0]`, `cycle`, and `visited[x]` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the assignment to `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1, x]`, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `visited[x]` is True; x is updated to `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`.**
