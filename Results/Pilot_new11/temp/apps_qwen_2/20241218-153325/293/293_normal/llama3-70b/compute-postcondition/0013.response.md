The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial conditions:

- `h` is an integer such that `1 ≤ h ≤ 50`.
- `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved.
- `ans` is updated based on the parity of `n`.

After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` is halved (floored). Since `n` must have been greater than 2 initially, it will now be a value less than or equal to half of its original value. The exact value of `n` depends on its initial value, but it will no longer be greater than 2.

The `ans` variable is updated based on whether `n` was even or odd before the operation. If `n` was even, `ans` was updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value. If `n` was odd, `ans` was updated by adding `n // 2` to its current value. After the operation, the parity of `n` changes, but the exact new value of `ans` depends on the previous state of `n`.

Since the exact initial value of `n` is not specified, the updated value of `n` will be `n / 2` (floored), and `ans` will be updated according to the previous parity of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is halved (floored) and is now ≤ 2, `ans` is updated based on the previous parity of `n`**.
