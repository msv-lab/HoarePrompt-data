`n` is 2, which is an even number. Therefore, the previous parity of `n` was even, and `ans` was previously updated to account for this. The code `ans += n // 2` means that `ans` is increased by `n // 2`, where `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is 2, `n // 2` is 1. Thus, `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is 2, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus 1**
