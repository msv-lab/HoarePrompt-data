The value of `n` is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`), and the result is added to `ans`. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` results in the integer part of `n / 2`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so `ans` is now `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2^`h` and `n` is odd; `ans` is `n // 2`**
