You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
    print(visited_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly simulates the traversal of the binary tree based on the binary representation of `n`. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Traversal Logic**: The program uses the binary representation of `n-1` to determine the path. However, the algorithm described requires alternating between 'L' and 'R' based on an infinite string "LRLRLRL...". The program does not account for this alternating pattern.

2. **Missing Revisiting and Backtracking Rules**: The program does not implement the rules for revisiting nodes and backtracking to the parent node if a node is already visited or if the player needs to return to the parent after reaching a non-exit leaf node.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:
- For `h = 2` and `n = 3`, the correct path would be "LRL", visiting nodes 1 (root), 2 (left child of root), 4 (right child of 2), and finally reaching the exit at node 4. The program, however, will output 3, which is incorrect because it does not follow the alternating 'L' and 'R' pattern.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the traversal as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \( h \) and \( n \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq h \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^h \). It then converts \( n \) into its binary representation (excluding the leading '1') and traverses a binary tree of height \( h \) according to the binary digits of \( n \). For each binary digit, it simulates moving left (if the digit is '0') or right (if the digit is '1') in the tree. The function counts the number of nodes visited during this traversal. After completing the traversal, it prints the count of visited nodes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
