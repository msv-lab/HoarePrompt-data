`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 1, so it is now 2. The values of `total_leaves`, `path`, `current_level`, and `current_node` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (one character shorter), `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 1 or 2 depending on the first character of the original `path`**
