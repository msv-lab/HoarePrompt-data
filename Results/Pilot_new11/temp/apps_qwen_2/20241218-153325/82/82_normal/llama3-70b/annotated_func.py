#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 1, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the loop, the variable `a` is set to the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is then returned. The function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified range, but it does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is zero. If either `a` or `b` is zero, the function still executes the loop but the behavior is undefined since the loop condition `while b:` will terminate immediately, leaving `a` unchanged. However, due to the nature of the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself. Therefore, the function implicitly handles this case by returning `a` when `b` becomes zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of the function func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(a, b)` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers between 1 and \(10^9\). It calculates the product of `a` and `b`, divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`, and returns the integer division of the result. The function does not handle cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return zero or negative values, which would lead to a division by zero error or non-integer results.
