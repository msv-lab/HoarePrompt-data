Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is non-zero.
   - In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Initial state: \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative integers with \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
   - After the first iteration: `a` is set to `b`, and `b` is set to `a % b`.
     - If `b` was non-zero, this reduces `b` by taking the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Each iteration further reduces `b` until it reaches zero.
   - The loop terminates when `b` becomes zero.

4. **Final State**:
   - When `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates.
   - The value of `a` in the final state is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.
   - Given the example outputs:
     - After 2 iterations: `a` is `b`, `b` is 0. This means `a` has taken the value of `b` from the previous iteration, and `b` is now zero.
     - After 3 iterations: `a` is 1, `b` is 0. This indicates that `a` reached 1 when `b` became zero, implying that the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` is 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`, the loop will eventually terminate with `a` being the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` being zero.
   - If the GCD is 1, `a` will be 1; otherwise, `a` would be the GCD value.
   - Since the problem does not specify the exact GCD, we conclude that `a` will be 1 and `b` will be 0 in the final state.
