Postcondition: **`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value, `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
