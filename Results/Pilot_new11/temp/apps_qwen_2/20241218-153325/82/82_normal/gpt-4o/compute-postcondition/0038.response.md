`min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, which are both equal to `a + candidate - 1` and `b + candidate - 1` respectively. The conditions regarding `k`, `candidate`, and `new_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`**
