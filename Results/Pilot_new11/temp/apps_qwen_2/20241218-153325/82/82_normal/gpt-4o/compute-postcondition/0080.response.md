Output State: **`new_a` is the final value of `new_a` computed after the loop, `new_b` is the final value of `new_b` computed after the loop, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop, `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`, `a` is the original value of `a`, `b` is the original value of `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, and `k` is the final value of `k` computed after the loop.**
