To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the for loop, let's break down the information given:

1. The current candidates list is `[k, diff // k]`.
2. The loop iterates over each candidate in this list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\)
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `diff // k` is an integer
- `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.

The loop will execute again with the next candidate in the list `[k, diff // k]`. Therefore, the next candidate will be either `k` or `diff // k`, depending on the order they were processed in the previous iteration.

Since we don't know which candidate was used in the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities for the next iteration:

### Case 1: Previous candidate was `k`
If the previous candidate was `k`, then the next candidate will be `diff // k`.

### Case 2: Previous candidate was `diff // k`
If the previous candidate was `diff // k`, then the next candidate will be `k`.

However, since we need to provide the state for the next iteration without making assumptions about the order, we should consider the general case where the next candidate could be either `k` or `diff // k`.

Thus, the state for the next iteration will be based on the next candidate being either `k` or `diff // k`. Since we don't know which specific candidate will be chosen, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues.

Given the loop condition and the information provided, the state adjustments would be as follows:

State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, `diff // k` is an integer, `new_b` is \((b + (k if previous_candidate_was_k else diff // k) - 1) // (k if previous_candidate_was_k else diff // k) * (k if previous_candidate_was_k else diff // k)\), `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `(k if previous_candidate_was_k else diff // k) < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**

Since we cannot determine the exact candidate without knowing the previous iteration's details, we'll represent it in a general form:

State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, `diff // k` is an integer, `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**
