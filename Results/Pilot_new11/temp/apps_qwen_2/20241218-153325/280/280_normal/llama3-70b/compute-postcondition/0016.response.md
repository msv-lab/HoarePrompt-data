Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`
- `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` retain their initial values
- `min_length` is `max_length + min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop starts from `t - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = t - 1`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1 each time until it reached `1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i > 0`.
   - Since `i` starts at `t - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than `1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `2`.
   - All other variables (`min_speed`, `max_length`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_length`) retain their values from the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` retain their initial values, `min_length` is `max_length + min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `i` is 2**
