`t` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, but `t` and `d` are now integers entered by the user. The precondition that `1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ t ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ d ≤ 10` remains valid, but since `v1` and `v2` are not affected by this operation, they are still within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `t` and `d` are assigned the values from the user's input**
