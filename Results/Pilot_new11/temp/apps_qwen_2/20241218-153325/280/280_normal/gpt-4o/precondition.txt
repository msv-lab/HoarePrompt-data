v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10. Additionally, it is guaranteed that there exists a valid sequence of speeds starting at v_1, ending at v_2, and changing by at most d between any two adjacent seconds.
