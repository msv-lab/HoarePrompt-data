According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `bind`, and `ind`. The loop condition is based on the range from `ind + 1` to `bind`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than `bind`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 1`, and since `bind` is greater than `ind`, there is at least one more index for `i` to take before reaching `bind`.

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `ind + 2`. Since `i` should still be less than `bind` for the loop to execute again, for the loop to be executed one more time, it must hold that `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`; `i` is `ind + 2` (so `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`)**
