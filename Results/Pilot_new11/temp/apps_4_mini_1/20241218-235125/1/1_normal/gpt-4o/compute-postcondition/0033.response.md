The code prints -1, which does not change any variable values in the state. As a result, the output state summarizes the unaltered conditions based on the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` or -1 if ']' does not exist in `s`; `i` is -1 after all iterations are completed; `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1 or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`; -1 is printed.**
