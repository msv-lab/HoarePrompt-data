Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `start_colon + 3`, `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` must be greater than `start_colon + 3`, and `pipe_count` is incremented by 1 (if the character at index `i` of `s` is '|', otherwise remains unchanged).**
