The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive); `n` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `ind` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
