The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is defined as `ind + 2`, we can conclude that `start_colon` will also be related to the values of `ind`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`; `i` is `ind + 2`; `start_colon` is equal to `ind + 2`.
