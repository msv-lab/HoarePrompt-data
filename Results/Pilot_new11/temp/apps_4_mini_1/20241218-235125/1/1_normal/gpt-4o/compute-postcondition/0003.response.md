According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n - 1`, thus if `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

Given that `ind` starts at -1, it is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, but it might be modified in the loop body. 

To ensure the loop will execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` will start from 0. 

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive); `n` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `ind` is -1**
