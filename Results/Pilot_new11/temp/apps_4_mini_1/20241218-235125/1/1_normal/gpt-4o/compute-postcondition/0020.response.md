The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `n - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, while the value of `bind` is now equal to `n - 1`. The value of `s[i]` remains `]`, but this does not affect the output state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is ']'**
