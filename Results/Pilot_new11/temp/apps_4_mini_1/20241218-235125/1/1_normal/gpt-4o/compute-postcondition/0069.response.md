To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the given conditions regarding the variables involved in the loop. We have the following:

1. The loop iterates over the range defined by `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon`.
2. `start_colon` must be a valid index and less than `end_colon`.
3. The loop will only execute if the starting index (i.e., `start_colon + 1`) is less than `end_colon`.

From the provided state before the loop execution, we know:
- `start_colon` is a valid index and not -1 (meaning it has a valid position in the string).
- `end_colon` is a valid index and not -1 (indicating it exists as well).

For the loop to execute:
- We must ensure that `start_colon + 1 < end_colon`, which means `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`. 

Additionally, since we also have the state variable `i` being initialized on loop execution, for the loop to properly start, `i` should begin at `start_colon + 1`, which means it is initialized correctly in respect to the starting point of the loop.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index not equal to -1**
