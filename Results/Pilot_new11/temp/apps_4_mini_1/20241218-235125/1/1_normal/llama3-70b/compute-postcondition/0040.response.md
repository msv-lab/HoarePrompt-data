Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']', with the character at index `i` of `s` being ':'; if the condition `f` is true, `bind` is set to `i`, which is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
