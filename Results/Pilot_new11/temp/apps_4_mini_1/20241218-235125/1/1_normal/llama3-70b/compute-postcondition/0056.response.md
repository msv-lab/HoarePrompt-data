Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is True and `bind` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is ':', `f` is True, and `bind` is set to `n - 3`, execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal either ']' or ':', then no changes are made to `bind`, `f`, or any other variables.***
