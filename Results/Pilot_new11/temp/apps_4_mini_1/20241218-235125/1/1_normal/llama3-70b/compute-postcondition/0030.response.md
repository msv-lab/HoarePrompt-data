Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `ind` is the index of the first ':' character that follows a '[', or remains -1 if no such ':' exists; `f` is True if at least one '[' was encountered, otherwise it is False. 

```
bind = -1
```

The variable `bind` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ind`, and `f`) remain unchanged. The Output State reflects that `bind` is now `-1`, while retaining the existing conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `ind` is the index of the first ':' character that follows a '[', or remains -1 if no such ':' exists; `f` is True if at least one '[' was encountered, otherwise it is False; `bind` is -1**.
