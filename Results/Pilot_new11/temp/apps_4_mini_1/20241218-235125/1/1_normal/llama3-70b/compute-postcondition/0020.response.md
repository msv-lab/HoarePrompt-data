Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then if `f` is true, `i` is increased by 1 and `ind` is set to `i + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
