Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ']', then `f` is set to True. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']', and if it is ':', and `f` is True, then `bind` is set to `i` (which is `n - 1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `bind` or `f`.***
