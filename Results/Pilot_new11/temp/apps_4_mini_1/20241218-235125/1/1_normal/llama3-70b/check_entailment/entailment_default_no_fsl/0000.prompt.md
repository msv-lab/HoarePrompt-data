You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
    if ind == -1 or bind == -1:
        print(-1)
    elif ind >= bind:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = 4
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == '|':
                ans += 1
        print(ans)


```
Output hints: Functionality: The function accepts a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500,000 characters. It searches for the first `:` that follows a `[`, and the last `:` that precedes a `]`. If either of these `:` indices is not valid (i.e., if one of them is `-1` or if the first index is greater than or equal to the last index), the function prints `-1`. If valid indices are found, it calculates a value `ans`, starting from `4`, and increments it by the count of `|` characters found between these two indices (exclusive). Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. If no valid `:` characters are found between the brackets, or if the configuration does not meet the specified conditions, it would result in `-1` being printed. 

This function, however, does not explicitly return a value; it only prints output based on the conditions evaluated. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `s` does not contain any `[` or `]` at all, which could lead to incorrect behavior or assumptions. Therefore, the complete behavior of the function considers potential edge cases like input strings with no valid bracket pairs or colons, ensuring that it accurately assesses the existence of necessary characters.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
