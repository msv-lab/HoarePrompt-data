Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It sorts the list `a` in descending order and calculates two sums: `b`, which is the sum of the integers at even indices, and `c`, which is the sum of the integers at odd indices within the sorted list. Finally, it prints the difference `b - c`. The function does not handle invalid inputs or provide output for cases where `n` does not meet specified constraints.**
