You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze how the program partitions the sequence and calculates the maximum value of \( B - C \).

The program performs the following steps:

1. It reads the integer \( n \), which represents the number of elements in the sequence.
2. It reads and sorts the elements of the sequence \( a \) in descending order.
3. It initializes two sums, \( b \) and \( c \), to zero.
4. In a loop that iterates through the sorted list, it assigns elements to \( b \) or \( c \) based on their index (even indices to \( b \) and odd indices to \( c \)).
5. Finally, it calculates and prints \( B - C \).

### Potential Issue:
The choice to assign elements to \( b \) and \( c \) based strictly on the index in a sorted list doesn't necessarily maximize \( B - C \). Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
3
1 1 -2
```

**Expected Output:**
- A correct partition might take \( b = \{1, 1\} \) (so \( B = 2 \)) and \( c = \{-2\} \) (so \( C = -2 \)). This gives \( B - C = 2 - (-2) = 4 \).

**Program Output:**
- The program would sort the array to get \( \{1, 1, -2\} \), then assign \( b = \{1\} \) (with the first element) and \( c = \{1, -2\} \) (the remaining elements). This leads to \( B = 1 \) and \( C = -1 \), thus \( B - C = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).

In this case, the program fails to achieve the maximum \( B - C \) value of 4, returning only 2 instead.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not generate the correct maximum value for all potential cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b, c = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `b` is the sum of `a[i]` for even `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `c` is the sum of `a[i]` for odd `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
    print(b - c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It sorts the list `a` in descending order and calculates two sums: `b`, which is the sum of the integers at even indices, and `c`, which is the sum of the integers at odd indices within the sorted list. Finally, it prints the difference `b - c`. The function does not handle invalid inputs or provide output for cases where `n` does not meet specified constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
