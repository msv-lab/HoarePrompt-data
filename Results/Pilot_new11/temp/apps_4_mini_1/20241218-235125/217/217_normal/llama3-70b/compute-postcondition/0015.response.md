The variable `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Since `i` is defined as being less than `n`, adding `a[i]` means that `b` will include the next value from the sorted list `a`. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `i` will still be less than `n` but will increment after this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` remains 0, `i` is now incremented to `i + 1`, and `i < n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` remains 0, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `i < n`.**
