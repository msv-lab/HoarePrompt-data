In this scenario, `B` is assigned the sum of the positive integers from the list `a`. Given that `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, the output state will depend on the contents of list `a`.

- If `a` contains positive integers, `B` will be the sum of those integers.
- If `a` does not contain any positive integers, then `B` will be 0.

The states of the other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected by this computation, so they remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a` (which could be 0 if there are no positive integers).**
