You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum possible value of B - C based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

- The program reads the integer n and the list of integers a.
- It calculates B as the sum of the positive integers in the list (elements belonging to sequence b), which is correct because we want to maximize B.
- It calculates C as the sum of the negative integers in the list (elements belonging to sequence c), which is also correct because including the negative values in sequence c minimizes their impact on B - C.
- The final computation of result as B - C is correctly implemented and printed.

Given the potential range of values for n and the elements of the list:
- If n = 1 and a = [-100], B will be 0 (since there are no positive numbers) and C will be -100. Thus, B - C = 0 - (-100) = 100, which the program will compute correctly.
- For a = [1, -2, 0], B will correctly sum the positives to get 1, C will sum the negatives to get -2, resulting in B - C = 1 - (-2) = 3.
- In cases where all numbers are negative, B will remain 0, and C will be the sum of those negative values, ensuring the result is as expected.

Therefore, the program handles all edge cases appropriately, and I cannot find any case where the implementation would fail to produce the correct output according to the problem description. Thus, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. It calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list (denoted as `B`) and the sum of all negative integers (denoted as `C`). The function then computes the difference `result` = B - C and prints this result. It does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where the input does not conform to the specified constraints (for example, it does not check if `n` matches the number of integers provided in the list `a`). The handling of empty input for the second line is also missing, even though `n` is guaranteed to be positive.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
