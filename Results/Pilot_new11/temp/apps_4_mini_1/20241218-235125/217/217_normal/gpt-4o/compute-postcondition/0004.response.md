Since `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`, the expression `result = B - C` calculates the difference between the sum of positive integers and the sum of negative integers. Here, `result` represents the overall effect of both sums where the negative contributions from `C` are subtracted from the positive contributions from `B`. 

Thus, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the new value of `result` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C`.**
