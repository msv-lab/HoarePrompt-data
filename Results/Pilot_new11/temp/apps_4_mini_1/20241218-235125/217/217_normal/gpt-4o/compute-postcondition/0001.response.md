`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split into elements. The initial state tells us that `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 100. Since `n` is already assigned, it represents the number of integers that will be in the list `a`. Each integer `a_i` in the list must satisfy the condition -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100. 

Given that the code reads a line of input containing `n` integers and then processes them into the list `a`, after execution, we know that `a` will contain exactly `n` integers that satisfy their given range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.**
