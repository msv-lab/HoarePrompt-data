To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and its logic step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, which correctly aligns with the problem description that states the first line is the count of cards followed by the integers on each card.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: The program uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer on the cards. This is appropriate as it allows us to determine how many cards there are for each integer effectively.

3. **Checking Unique Numbers**: The program creates a list of unique numbers sorted by their counts. The problem description states that for a fair game, Petya and Vasya must select different integers, and the total count of cards each selects must be equal, meaning there should be at least two different numbers.

4. **Game Fairness Conditions**: 
   - The program first checks if there are at least two unique integers. If not, it outputs "NO", which adheres to the problem requirement that Petya and Vasya must choose different integers.
   - It then checks if the two most frequent integers each have a count equal to `n // 2`. If they do, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers, conforming to the problem's fairness condition.
   - If the conditions for fairness are not met, it outputs "NO".

5. **Return Values**: 
   - The output strings ("YES" or "NO") along with the respective chosen integers when applicable strictly follow the problem requirements.

### Examples and Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where:
  - All cards are the same (should return "NO").
  - Two distinct numbers have equal counts (should return "YES").
  - More than two distinct numbers exist but do not satisfy the fair game condition (should return "NO").
  
### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all described cases:

- For valid inputs as per the specification, it will determine correctly whether a fair game is possible.
- The outputs align with the requirements set forth in the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
