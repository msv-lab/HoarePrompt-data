Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that a fair distribution is only possible if the two most frequent numbers appear exactly `n/2` times each. This is not necessarily the case, as it ignores scenarios where there are more than two unique numbers with the possibility of distributing the cards in a fair manner.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
1
2
1
2
3
3
```

In this scenario, Petya could choose `1` and Vasya could choose `2`, resulting in Petya having 2 cards (the two `1`s) and Vasya having 2 cards (the two `2`s). However, the current implementation would output "NO," incorrectly concluding that a fair distribution is impossible.

Thus, the program fails to account for valid distributions outside of the top two counts, leading to incorrect results in such cases.
