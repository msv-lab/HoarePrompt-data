To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, I will analyze the provided implementation.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - An even number `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards.
   - `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing card values.

2. **Output**: 
   - If a fair game is possible, print "YES" followed by two distinct integers (the numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya).
   - If not, print "NO".

3. **Conditions for fairness**:
   - Both chosen integers must result in an equal number of cards for each player.
   - Both integers must be distinct.

### Review of the Code:
1. **Counter and Unique Values**: 
   - The code uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each card number.
   - It then creates a sorted list of the unique numbers based on their frequency.

2. **Logic**:
   - It checks if there are at least two unique numbers.
   - It checks if the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case with Less than Two Unique Numbers**:
   - If all cards have the same value, the program correctly outputs "NO" since distinct integers are required.
   - Example: `2, 6, 6`.

2. **Case with More than Two Unique Numbers**:
   - The program checks only the top two most frequent card values. 
   - It does not handle the case where there might be multiple distinct numbers, and selecting the right pair is crucial.
   - For instance, given the cards: `[10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 20]`, the output is "NO", but it should also consider other pair combinations.

3. **Edge Case Example**:
   - List: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` — Here both have equal counts, the program correctly outputs "NO". It does work as expected.
   - Now consider: Input `4, 1, 1, 2, 2` (4 cards, `1` occurs twice, `2` occurs twice). This should be valid and produce "YES" output as both players get 2 cards.

### Conclusion:
The logic relies solely on the two most frequent numbers and doesn't comprehensively assess all combinations that could lead to a valid configuration for a fair game.

### Final Assessment:
The program overlooks valid combinations that can provide distinct integers with equal numbers of cards. The testing of edge cases reveals this flaw.

Correctness: **False**. 

A specific failing case would be:
- Input: `4`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `2`, should yield "YES" and not "NO".
