The value of `n` is re-assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new input. The previous condition states that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, but now the specific value of `n` can change based on user input, subject to that condition. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the array of integers represented by `a_i` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and is replaced by the input integer; the values of the n integers a_i (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) remain unchanged.**
