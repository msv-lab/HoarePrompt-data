The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (ensured to be even and within the range specified), followed by `n` integers. This aligns with the input requirements of the problem.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program constructs a dictionary `d` that counts how many times each unique integer appears among the `n` cards. This is essential for determining whether it's possible for both players to select different integers and still have an equal number of cards.

3. **Finding Valid Integers**: The program checks through the dictionary `d` to find if there are exactly two distinct integers that both appear `n // 2` times. This is the crucial criterion for a fair game, where both players can select a unique number and receive an equal share of the cards.

4. **Output**: If it finds two such integers, it outputs "YES" along with the two integers; otherwise, it outputs "NO". This matches the expected output behavior in the problem description.

5. **Complete Coverage of Cases**:
   - If there are duplicate integers such that only one appears in sufficient quantity or not enough distinct integers are available, the output will correctly indicate that a fair game is impossible.
   - If the numbers on the cards do not allow two distinct victories, the logic captures that and responds accordingly.

Therefore, the program adheres to the specifications of the problem description for all possible valid inputs defined by the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
