In the given code snippet, `a.append(int(input()))`, the variable `a` will have an integer value appended to it that is taken from user input and converted to an integer using `int()`. The initial state of the variables does not include `a`, but it is implied that `a` exists as a list where we can append new entries.

Since `n` and `i` are unchanged by this operation, we will only update `a` to include the newly appended value from the input.

As `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 and `i` is 0, the output state will reflect the new value of `a` with one additional integer, but since we don't know the actual input, we'll refer to it as an "input integer."

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` now contains the previous elements plus an input integer.**
