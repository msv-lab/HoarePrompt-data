You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input

11
27

Output

Output

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the next n lines contain integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the n cards. Each number a_i may appear multiple times.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` contains `n` integers received as inputs.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating how many elements with a count equal to `n // 2` have been found, `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), and if no such integers were found `a1` and `a2` remain -1.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a1` and `a2` are both not -1, then 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. If either `a1` or `a2` is -1, then 'NO' has been printed, indicating that either no integers with a count of `n // 2` were found or that they do not correspond to valid integers with that count.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, and then reads `n` integers that represent the values on `n` cards. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear `n / 2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where fewer or more than two integers have the required count, and it does not validate the input bounds for the integers beyond ensuring they are between 1 and 100.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
