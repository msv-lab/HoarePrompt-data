Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, and `d` has at least `m + 1` elements. If `d[i]` is equal to `n / 2`, then if `c` was previously 0, `c` is updated to 1, `a1` is set to the current value of `i`, and `a2` is set to its previous value. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged or is updated based on previous values, `a1` takes the previous value of `i`, and `a2` takes the current value of `i`, at which point we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
