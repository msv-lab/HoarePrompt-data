The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, `c` is either 0 or 1 (if `c` was 0 it becomes 1), `a1` is the previous value of `i`, `a2` is set to the current value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
