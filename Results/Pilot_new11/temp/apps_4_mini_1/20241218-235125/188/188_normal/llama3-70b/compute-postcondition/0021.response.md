The variable `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unaffected, but the third integer from the list `a`, which is `i`, determines the index for the `d` array. Since `i` holds a specific value (the third integer), `d[i]` indicates that the count at index `i` in the array `d` is increased by 1. 

The output state updates the value of `d[i]` without changing the others. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer from list `a`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer from list `a`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1**
