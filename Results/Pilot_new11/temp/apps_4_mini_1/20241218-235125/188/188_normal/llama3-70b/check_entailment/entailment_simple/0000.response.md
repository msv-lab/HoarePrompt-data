To determine the correctness of the annotated Python program, we need to analyze its behavior against the problem description step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
1. **Input**: An even number `n` followed by `n` integers on the cards.
2. **Output**: Either "YES" with two distinct integers that split the cards evenly or "NO" if such a configuration isn't possible.
3. **Game Fairness**:
   - Both integers must yield the same number of cards, which means each integer must appear `n / 2` times.
   - The selected integers must be distinct from one another.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling**:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    ```
   - This correctly reads `n` and the next `n` integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
    ```python
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    ```
   - This populates a dictionary `d` where keys are the card values and values are their counts. This is necessary for assessing the fairness condition.

3. **Finding Two Distinct Integers**:
    ```python
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    ```
   - The loop checks for numbers that appear exactly `n / 2` times. The variables `a1` and `a2` store the first two integers that satisfy this condition.

4. **Output Specification**:
    ```python
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1):
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')
    ```
   - This block prints "YES" and the integers if two are found; otherwise it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check
- The program checks for the two distinct integers that each appear `n / 2` times, ensuring they can take all cards evenly.
- If only one unique integer exists (or all are the same), or if no two distinct integers meet the criteria, it correctly outputs "NO".
- The program also respects the limits of card occurrences and ranges defined within the problem description.

### Conclusion
The logic and flow of the program match the requirements set forth in the problem description. It effectively identifies whether a balanced and fair game can be formed, and handles all edge cases as defined.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
