Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, and `c` is either 1 or a positive integer greater than 1. If `c` was originally 0, it becomes 1 and `a1` is set to the value of `i`, while `a2` is the new iteration value. If `c` was originally 1 or a positive integer greater than 1, `c` remains unchanged, and `a1` is set to the value of `i` with `a2` as the new iteration value. If `c` was 0, it now becomes 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged, with `a1` reflecting the previous value of `i` and `a2` reflecting the current value of `i`, allowing for a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
