The variable `a` is updated by appending an integer obtained from user input. The initial state indicates that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, and `a` contains previous elements. The value of `a` will now include that new integer from input. 

No other variables change in this execution. The output state reflects the inclusion of the new integer in `a`, while the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` now contains the previous elements plus an input integer.**
