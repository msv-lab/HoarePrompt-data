Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating how many elements with a count equal to `n // 2` have been found; `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2`, and `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2`. The current values of `a1` and `a2` are both not equal to -1.***
