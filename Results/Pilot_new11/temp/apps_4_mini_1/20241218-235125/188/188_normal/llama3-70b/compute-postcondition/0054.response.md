The code `print(a1, a2)` will display the values of `a1` and `a2`. Given that `c` indicates the count of elements with a count equal to `n // 2`, and `a1` and `a2` contain the first and second integers found with that count, it confirms that both `a1` and `a2` have been found and are valid integers.

Since `print` does not change the values of `a1` or `a2`, the only observable impact is the printing of their values. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a` contains `n` integers; `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2; `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2`; `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2`; 'YES' has been printed; `a1` and `a2` have been printed.**
