Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, and `c` updates according to its initial value: if `c` was originally 0, it becomes 1 while `a1` is set to the value of `i` and `a2` is the new iteration value; if `c` was originally 1 or a positive integer greater than 1, `c` remains unchanged, with `a1` reflecting the value of `i` and `a2` reflecting the current value of `i`.***
