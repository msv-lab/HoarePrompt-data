Functionality: **The function reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, and then reads `n` integers that represent the values on `n` cards. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear `n / 2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where fewer or more than two integers have the required count, and it does not validate the input bounds for the integers beyond ensuring they are between 1 and 100.**
