Given the initial state where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the execution of the code `n = int(input())` indicates that the value of `n` will be updated based on user input. However, since it is dependent on input from the user, we can't definitively specify the new value of `n` without knowing that input. The potential new value of `n` could still be an even integer within the range of 2 to 100.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` will now take on a new value based on user input, maintaining its defined constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and will take a new value based on user input.**
