According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least two digits, the loop will execute again for the second digit. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least one integer digit, and `decimal_value` is equal to `digit` of the current iteration. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least two digits, and `digit` must be the next digit in the list.

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list containing at least 2 integer digits, `base` is an integer in the range [2, 40], `decimal_value` is equal to the next digit in the list**.
