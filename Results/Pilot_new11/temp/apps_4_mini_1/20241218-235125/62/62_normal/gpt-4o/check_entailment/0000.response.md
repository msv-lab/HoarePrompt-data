Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts numbers X and Y from their respective bases to decimal and compares them according to the given problem description. Here is why I believe the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program properly reads the input values for both numbers, including their bases and digits.
2. **Base Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` converts the digits from their respective bases to a decimal value using a standard formula for base conversion. This logic is valid for any base between 2 and 40, as specified.
3. **Comparison**: After obtaining the decimal values for both X and Y, the program accurately compares them and prints the appropriate relational symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison.

The logic takes care of valid input ranges (digits are always within the correct range for the specified base), and since there are no leading zeroes in valid input, it avoids any issues related to that. Therefore, I see no case where this program would fail to meet the problem description.
