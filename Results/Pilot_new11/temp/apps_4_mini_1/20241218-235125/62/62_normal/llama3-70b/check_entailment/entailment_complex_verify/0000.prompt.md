You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the input and output logic.

1. The problem requires reading a number X in base `b_x` and a number Y in base `b_y`, and then comparing these two numbers.
2. The program correctly reads both numbers and their respective bases.
3. It converts the digits of the numbers from their respective bases into their decimal equivalents using the `func_1` function, which performs the conversion by iterating through the digits.
4. After converting both numbers to their decimal forms, it proceeds to compare them and print the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

Now, let's check for potential edge cases where the program could fail:

- The program correctly handles bases from 2 to 40, which aligns with the problem constraints.
- It also ensures that there are no leading zeroes in the number representation which adheres to the problem description.
- The digits are guaranteed to be valid for their respective bases, as mentioned in the constraints (0 ≤ x_i < b_x for X, and 0 ≤ y_i < b_y for Y).

Given that all specified conditions of conversion and comparison are sufficiently addressed, I cannot find any input case that the program fails to handle based on the problem description.

Thus, my evaluation of the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly converts the input, handles different bases appropriately, and compares the two numbers accurately, thus fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the number in base notation where each integer is a digit (0 ≤ digit < base), and base is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40. The digits list should not have leading zeroes unless it is the representation of the number zero itself.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the base `base` integer representation of `digits`, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40.
    return result
    #The program returns the base 'base' integer representation of the list 'digits', where 'result' is equal to that representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` within the range of 2 to 40. It computes and returns the integer value of the number represented by the provided `digits` in the specified base. The function does not handle cases of invalid input, such as digits that are not within the range of allowable values for the given base (0 to base-1) or if the `digits` list contains leading zeros beyond the valid representation of zero. The final output is the base `base` integer representation of the `digits`, calculated by treating the list as a multi-digit number in that base.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
