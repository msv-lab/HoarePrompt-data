The code `divisors = []` initializes the variable `divisors` as an empty list. Since this operation does not affect `n` or other variables, the output state will only reflect the change in `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list.**
