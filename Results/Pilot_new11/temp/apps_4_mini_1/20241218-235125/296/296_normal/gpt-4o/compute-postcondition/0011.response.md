According to the code, the loop iterates for values of `i` starting from 2 up to the integer square root of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been incremented by 1 compared to its value at the start of that iteration. If `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2, and if `i` is currently less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, then the loop can execute again. 

Specifically, at the conclusion of the last iteration, since `i` would have been `k`, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to run once more, `k + 1` must still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions are:
- `i` should be updated to `k + 1`
- and they must satisfy `k + 1 <= int(math.sqrt(n))` which simplifies to `n` must be at least `(k + 1)²`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `i` is k + 1; `divisors` contains 2 if `n` is divisible by `i`, and if `i` < `n // i`, then `divisors` will be updated accordingly.**
