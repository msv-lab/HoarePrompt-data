The statement `divisors.append(n // i)` causes the value of `n` to be divided by `i`, which is `k + 2`. The result of that division (integer division) is appended to the list `divisors`. 

Given that:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( (k + 1)^2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and is greater than 2,
- `k` remains unchanged,
- `i` is `k + 2`,
- `divisors` is updated to include the new value.

After executing the code, the state of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- The value `n // i` is calculated, resulting in an integer (let's denote this value as `new_divisor`).
- The updated `divisors` list now includes this new divisor.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)Â² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `k` remains as is; `i` is `k + 2`; and `divisors` now includes the value `n // (k + 2)`.**
