Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9). It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' in such cases. If `n` is a prime number (indicated by an empty list of divisors), it also returns 'NO'. If `n` is not prime, it collects all divisors of `n` (other than 1 and `n` itself), returning 'YES' along with the count of these divisors and a list of fractions of the form (1, d) for each divisor `d`. The function handles potential edge cases involving the smallest inputs and correctly identifies prime numbers.**
