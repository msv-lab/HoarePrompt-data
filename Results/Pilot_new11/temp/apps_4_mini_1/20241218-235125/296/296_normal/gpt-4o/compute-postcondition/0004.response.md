According to the code, the loop is set to execute for values of `i` that range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer greater than 2, the square root of `n` will also be greater than 1. This means that at the start of the loop, `i` will begin at 2. Furthermore, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will ensure that the loop can execute for at least the first value of `i`.

The `divisors` list being empty will not affect the loop's execution, as it's merely a container for the subsequent results of the loop; therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

To summarize, the loop can successfully execute with the current state since appropriate values of `i` can be derived from the starting value and the end value defined by `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2.**
