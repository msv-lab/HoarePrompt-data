The code snippet prints the value of `k`, which is 2 in this case. Since the code is not modifying any variables, only `k` is relevant for the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; 'YES' has been printed; the value 2 has been printed.**
