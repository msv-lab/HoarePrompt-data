The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates based on the constraint that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since the provided function definition does not include `n` as a parameter, it implies that the function likely retrieves `n` from another source or context internally. The output behavior is not specified in the question, so we cannot define what the function returns based on the given information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not fully determinable from the current details. However, based on the constraints given:

Functionality: **The function operates based on a positive integer n, such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, but does not accept parameters and the return value is unspecified.**
