You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program closely. 

The problem requires finding a sequence of fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) such that:
1. Each \(b_i\) divides \(n\) and \(1 < b_i < n\).
2. Each \(1 \le a_i < b_i\).
3. The sum of the fractions must equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

Given the input \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs "NO" because there are no values for \(b_i\) that satisfy \(1 < b_i < 2\). Hence, this particular case is handled correctly.

For \(n = 6\), the output is "YES", and it chooses the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\). The program shows that these fractions sum up to \(1 - \frac{1}{6}\), thereby satisfying the condition.

However, the critical flaw in the program lies in how it handles values of \(n > 2\). When \(n = 6\), the program outputs valid fractions, but it doesn't generalize this strategy for other values of \(n\) (specifically those that may not evenly lend themselves to producing valid \(b_i\)). For example:
- If \(n = 4\): The program outputs "YES" and chooses \(b_i\) values such as \(2\) (where \(1 < b_i < n\)). However, the program fails to explore larger values or combinations that could exist, overlooking potentially valid cases.

Let's consider further:
- The program provides neither robustness for various divisors nor generates sums for other possible numerators, such as those from \(1\) to \(n/2\), which might yield valid fractions.

Thus, not only does the program lack comprehensive handling for all \(n > 2\), but it also assumes any \(n\) > 2 is valid without checking the constraints laid out by the problem description properly.

In conclusion, the program's logic is incomplete and incorrect when approaching values of \(n>2\) and lacks necessary checks and balances.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided Python program is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 2, then 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, the value 2 has been printed, and the output is '1' followed by the current value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from input within the range 2 to 10^9. If `n` equals 2, it prints 'NO'. For all other values of `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then outputs the string '1' along with the integer `n // 2`, and then again outputs '1' followed by the integer `n`. Note that there is no return value from the function and it does not accept any parameters. The function handles the edge case of `n` being exactly 2 distinctly from any other value of `n`. However, there are no checks or handling for values outside the specified range, which is stated to be between 2 and 10^9, should it not be guaranteed by the context of use.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
