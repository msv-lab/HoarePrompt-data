The variable `computer_cost` is assigned the value `1234`. The other variables, `n`, `house_cost`, and `car_cost`, remain unaffected by this assignment. The Output State now reflects the updated value of `computer_cost` along with the unchanged variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234**
