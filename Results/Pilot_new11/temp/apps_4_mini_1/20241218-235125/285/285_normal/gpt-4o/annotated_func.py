    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` for the last value of `a` calculated; `remaining_after_cars` is less than `car_cost` for the last value of `b` calculated, indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought, the remaining amount is not sufficient to buy even a single computer. If 'YES' was not returned during execution, it means that for all combinations of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) checked, the remaining after cars was never divisible by `computer_cost`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from 'n', the remaining amount was never divisible by 'computer_cost'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing a budget and evaluates whether it is possible to allocate this budget to purchase a specific number of houses, cars, and computers based on their fixed costs: `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`. It loops through all possible quantities of houses (`a`) and checks for the maximum possible quantity of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining budget. After maximizing car purchases, it checks if the leftover amount is divisible by `computer_cost`. If at least one valid combination is found, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Its final state indicates whether the budget allows for buying these items under given constraints. Notably, the function primarily determines divisibility involving `computer_cost` after attempting to purchase the other two items, and it does not consider situations where the budget is less than the cost of a house or car, which could be edge cases to address.
