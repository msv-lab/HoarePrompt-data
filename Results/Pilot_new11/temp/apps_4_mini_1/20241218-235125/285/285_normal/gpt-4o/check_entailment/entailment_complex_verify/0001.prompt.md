You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether Kolya can spend his initial game-coin score `n` on houses, cars, and computers, which cost 1,234,567, 123,456, and 1,234 game-coins respectively. 

### Explanation:
1. The outer loop iterates through the number of houses (`a`) that could be purchased, starting from 0 up to `n // house_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of houses within the budget are considered.

2. For each possible number of houses, the program calculates the remaining coins after accounting for the cost of houses and then enters a second loop to consider the number of cars (`b`) that can be purchased with the remaining coins.

3. After subtracting the cost of the cars from the remaining coins, the program checks if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of computers. If this is true, then there exists a valid combination of purchases that totals exactly `n`.

4. If a combination is found that meets the requirement, the function returns 'YES'; if all combinations are exhausted without finding one, it returns 'NO'.

### Edge Cases:
- The program effectively handles boundary cases, including the minimum value for `n` (1) and maximum value (1,000,000,000).
- It considers all potential combinations of non-negative integers for the quantities of each item purchased, ensuring the solution accounts for all possible ways to reach `n`.

Since the program is designed to handle all potential cases correctly based on the structured logic of nested loops and modulus checks, it can accurately determine whether the money can be spent as described. Therefore, the answer is **True**; the program is correct as per the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` for the last value of `a` calculated; `remaining_after_cars` is less than `car_cost` for the last value of `b` calculated, indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought, the remaining amount is not sufficient to buy even a single computer. If 'YES' was not returned during execution, it means that for all combinations of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) checked, the remaining after cars was never divisible by `computer_cost`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from 'n', the remaining amount was never divisible by 'computer_cost'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing a budget and evaluates whether it is possible to allocate this budget to purchase a specific number of houses, cars, and computers based on their fixed costs: `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`. It loops through all possible quantities of houses (`a`) and checks for the maximum possible quantity of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining budget. After maximizing car purchases, it checks if the leftover amount is divisible by `computer_cost`. If at least one valid combination is found, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Its final state indicates whether the budget allows for buying these items under given constraints. Notably, the function primarily determines divisibility involving `computer_cost` after attempting to purchase the other two items, and it does not consider situations where the budget is less than the cost of a house or car, which could be edge cases to address.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
