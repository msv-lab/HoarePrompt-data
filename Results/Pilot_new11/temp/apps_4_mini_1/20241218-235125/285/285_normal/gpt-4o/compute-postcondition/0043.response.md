To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we analyze its impact step by step.

1. The code updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` by subtracting `b * car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses`.
2. Given that `b` is currently equal to `1`, this simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.
3. The value of `remaining_after_houses` was defined as `n - a * house_cost`, which is still valid after execution.
4. The condition states that `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `0`, ensuring that the subtraction of `car_cost` still results in a non-negative value for `remaining_after_cars`.
5. The variable `remaining_after_cars` is recalculated based on the previously defined relationships but will be adjusted according to the value of `car_cost`.

Based on this analysis, the updated values are:

- `remaining_after_cars` becomes equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, which adheres to all specified conditions since `car_cost` is greater than 0.

Since all other values and relationships remain unchanged, the output state captures all relevant details. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which must be greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now 1; `car_cost` must be greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
