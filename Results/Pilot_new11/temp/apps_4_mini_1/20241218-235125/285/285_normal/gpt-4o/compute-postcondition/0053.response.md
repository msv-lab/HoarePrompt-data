The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The function contains several cases for its return values:

- Case 1: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for cost allocations have been met.
- Case 2: The function returns 'YES' regardless of the specific values of `n`, `car_cost`, `a`, `remaining_after_houses`, `remaining_after_cars`, and `computer_cost`, as 'YES' is explicitly returned.
- Case 3: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case 4: The function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions related to `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` which is a multiple of `computer_cost` are satisfied.
- Case 5: The function returns 'YES' indicating that `n` is sufficient to cover `house_cost` and `remaining_after_houses` allows for `car_cost`, while `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.
- Case 6: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions regarding `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` have been satisfied.
- Case 7: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing the houses, cars, and computers are met.
- Case 8: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case 9: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case 10: The function returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from `n`, the remaining amount was never divisible by `computer_cost`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on several conditions related to cost allocations and purchasing capabilities of houses, cars, and computers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on various cost allocation conditions.**
