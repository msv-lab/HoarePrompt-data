Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is 1, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that `n` is sufficient to cover `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` allows for `car_cost`, while `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.***
