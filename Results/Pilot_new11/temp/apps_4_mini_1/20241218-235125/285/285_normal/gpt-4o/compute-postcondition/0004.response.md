The variable `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. Given that `a` is 0, this calculation simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n - 0 * house_cost`, which further reduces to `remaining_after_houses = n`. The variable `house_cost` remains constant at 1234567, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`. Thus, the state of `n` is still that it is greater than or equal to 1234567. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567; `a` is 0; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`.**
