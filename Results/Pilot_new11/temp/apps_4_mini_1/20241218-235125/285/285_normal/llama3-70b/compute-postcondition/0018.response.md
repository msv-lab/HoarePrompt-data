Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is at least 0 and must be less than or equal to `(n // 123456)`, `c` is a non-negative integer calculated from `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, and if the loop executed completely without finding a valid combination, `n` must not be expressible in the form `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` for any non-negative integers `b` and `c`.**
