The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a user-provided input and `int` converts that input to an integer. Since the value of `n` was initially constrained to be a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), after this code executes, `n` will be reassigned to the new positive integer input that is also within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `n` while maintaining the information about its constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (updated value from input)**
