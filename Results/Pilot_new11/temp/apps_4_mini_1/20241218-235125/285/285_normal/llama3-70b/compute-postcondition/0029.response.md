The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variable values are changed through calculations or assignments since the program exits before any further code execution occurs. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial values of the variables, and indicate that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1358023) // 1234`, and the program has exited.**
