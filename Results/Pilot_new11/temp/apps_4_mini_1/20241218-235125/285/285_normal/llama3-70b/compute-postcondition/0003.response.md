The variable `c` is assigned the value of `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. Given that `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, the expression simplifies to `c = (n - 0 * 1234567 - 0 * 123456) // 1234`, which further simplifies to `c = n // 1234`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `c` will also be a non-negative integer (specifically the integer division of `n` by 1234). 

The states of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `n // 1234`.**
