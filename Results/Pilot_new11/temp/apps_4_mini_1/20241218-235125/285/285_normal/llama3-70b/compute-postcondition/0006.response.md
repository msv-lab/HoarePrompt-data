The code `exit()` ends the program execution immediately. None of the variable values change as a result of the code execution, and no further calculations or variable assignments occur. Therefore, the output state retains all existing information about the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `n // 1234`, and the expression (c * 1234 == n) holds true; 'YES' has been printed.**
