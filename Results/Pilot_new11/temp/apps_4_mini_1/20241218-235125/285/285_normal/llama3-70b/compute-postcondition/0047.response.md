The `exit()` command terminates the program immediately and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions are still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is now equal to `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` still holds true.**
