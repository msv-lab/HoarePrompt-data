To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `N`: Total different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be included in the gifts.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of coins `x` that each friend can gift such that:
     - Each friend gifts the same number of coins (`x`).
     - All coins gifted (`M * x`) must be unique.
     - At least `L` of the gifted coins should be new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The total coins gifted must not exceed what is still available (i.e., `M * x` should not exceed `N - K`).
   - The quantity of new coins should fulfill the requirement of at least `L`.

### Implementation Analysis:

1. **Calculation of `min_x`**:
   - The program computes `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is an integer division rounded up. This gives the minimum coins each friend needs to give to ensure at least `L` new coins total.

2. **Validation Check**:
   - The program then checks if the total coins gifted by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of different coins available after excluding the ones Ivan already has (`N - K`). If this condition holds, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Condition for Unique Coins**:
   - The program ensures that the number of coins gifted `M * min_x` does not exceed `N - K`. This is necessary to ensure that all coins are unique as required.

2. **Counting New Coins**:
   - The rounding up of `L` when divided by `M` ensures that at least `L` new coins can be achieved when every friend gifts `min_x`.

3. **Output Values**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum number of coins `min_x` or `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and addresses all the requirements for each potential case as outlined in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
