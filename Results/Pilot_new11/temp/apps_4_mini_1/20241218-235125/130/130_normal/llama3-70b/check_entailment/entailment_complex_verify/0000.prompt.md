You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation of the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description

We need to find the minimum number of coins (let's denote it by `x`, where `x` is the number of coins each of Ivan's friends will gift) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins (`x`).
2. The total coins gifted must be different. Given that there are `M` friends, Ivan receives `M * x` coins.
3. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.
4. Additionally, consider the edge cases with the limits of the variables (`1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18`).

### Program Logic

The provided function checks two conditions:

- If the number of different coins (`N - K`) available to gift, plus the coins Ivan already has (`K`), is enough to satisfy his friends when `M` (the number of friends) is equal to or less than the available different coins.
- If the number of friends (`M`) is at least equal to the number of new coins required (`L`).

The function returns `1` if both conditions are met. If not, it returns `-1`.

### Example Inputs

Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Input: `20 15 2 3`**
   - Total coins Ivan can have = `20`
   - Coins in Ivan's collection = `2`
   - Friends = `15`
   - New coins needed = `3`
   - Here, `M (15)` is less than `N - K + 1 (19)` and also `M (15)` is greater than `L (3)`. Therefore, output should be `1`. The output is correct.

2. **Input: `10 11 2 4`**
   - Here, the total coins Ivan can have is `10`.
   - Coins in Ivan's collection = `2`
   - Friends = `11`
   - New coins needed = `4`
   - The total number of different coins (10) is less than the friends (11 `> 10`), and hence not all friends can gift different coins. Thus, it should output `-1`. The output is correct.

### Edge Cases Not Considered

However, there might be edge cases that we're not fully handling:

- Imagine `N = 5, K = 2, M = 3, L = 3`. According to the implemented logic:
  - `N - K = 3`, and even if all friends gift coins, they can at most gift `3` different coins (which would also be all new) so `L` is satisfied, but there aren't enough different coins for all friends to give because `M != M * x` (they cannot gift `x` such that `M * x > 5`). The condition `M >= N - K + 1` will fail, thus it would return `-1` mistakenly while it should have ideally suggested that there's no way to satisfy the condition with `x = 1`.

### Conclusion

The function fails to address some combinations of inputs, especially with smaller values, where `M * x` might exceed `N`. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `M` meets these conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four positive integers N, M, K, and L. It checks whether M is greater than or equal to both (N - K + 1) and L. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 1, indicating that M meets the criteria. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that M does not meet the criteria. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the evaluation of the conditions. Note that potential edge cases, such as what happens if M is on the boundary of the conditions or if any of the input parameters exceed expected values beyond given constraints, are not handled in the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
