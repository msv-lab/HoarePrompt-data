The variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which will be in the format of four space-separated integers. The initial conditions state that these variables are positive integers, and after the execution of the code, they will still be positive integers. However, their specific values will now reflect the user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer, `L` is a positive integer, where `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are equal to the integers provided by the input.**
