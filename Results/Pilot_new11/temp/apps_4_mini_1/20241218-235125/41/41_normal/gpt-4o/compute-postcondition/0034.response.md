Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, and `i` is 2. If the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
