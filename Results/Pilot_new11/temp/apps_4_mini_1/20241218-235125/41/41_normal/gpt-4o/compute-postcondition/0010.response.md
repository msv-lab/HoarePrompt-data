According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 1000. Since the loop is designed to iterate `n` times, the next iteration can occur as long as the current iteration count is less than `n`. 

Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, and the loop has completed one iteration already, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the total number of iterations reaches `n`. If `_` is the current count of completed iterations (which is 1), then for the loop to run again, it can proceed if the completed iteration count is less than `n`.

Therefore, if the current count of iterations is increased by 1 (making it 2), then `n` must still allow for at least one more execution.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, ratings now includes the tuple (a, b), if the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b`, and the current iteration count is 2.**
