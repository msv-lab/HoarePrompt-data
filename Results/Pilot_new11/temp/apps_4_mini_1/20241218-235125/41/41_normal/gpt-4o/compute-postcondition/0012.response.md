The `ratings` list is appended with the tuple `(a, b)`, indicating that a new rating has been added based on the current values of `a` and `b`. The only condition affecting this operation is that the values of `a` and `b` are not equal. Since this condition is satisfied, the update takes place.

The initial conditions that remain valid after the execution are:
- `n` is between 2 and 1000.
- `is_rated` is True.
- `is_unrated` is False.
- `a` is a new input integer.
- `b` is a new input integer.
- `ratings` now includes the tuple `(a, b)`, confirming that `a` is not equal to `b`.
- The current iteration count is 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 2.**
