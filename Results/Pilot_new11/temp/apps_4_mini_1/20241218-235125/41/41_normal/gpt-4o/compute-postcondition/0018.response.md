The value of `is_rated` is already `True`, so the execution of the code does not change any variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuples previously in the list plus the new tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 3.
