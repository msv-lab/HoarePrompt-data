According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 1 less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, we focus on the conditions necessary for the loop to run again. Given the state that `n` is at least 2, to allow for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2 if it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True if `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0], i is 2`**
