You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To thoroughly verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic of the problem description and how the program implements this logic:

1. **Input:** The program reads the number of participants `n` and then reads `n` pairs of integers representing each participant's rating before and after the round.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If at least one participant's rating has changed (i.e., `a != b` for any participant), the round is rated, so the program should return "rated".
   - If no participant's ratings have changed, the program checks whether the ratings are in a non-increasing order (meaning a participant with a higher ranking should not have a lower rating than a participant with a lower ranking). If they are not in that order, it would indicate that the round is "unrated", and the program should return "unrated".
   - If the participants' ratings are unchanged and in non-increasing order, the program should acknowledge that it is impossible to determine whether the round was rated or not, hence returning "maybe".

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Detects "rated":** The program correctly checks if any rating has changed. If it detects any change, it sets `is_rated` to `True` and prints "rated".

2. **Detects "unrated":** If no ratings have changed, it checks if there is any anomaly in the standings (whether any participant with a lower rating is ahead of a participant with a higher rating). If it finds such a case, it sets `is_unrated` to `True` and prints "unrated".

3. **Detects "maybe":** If the ratings are unchanged and the order of the standings is as it should be (non-increasing), it prints "maybe".

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's consider various scenarios to ensure the code performs as expected:

- **Case 1:** All ratings change.
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    1500 1600
    1400 1450
    1300 1350
    ```
  - Expected Output: "rated" (Correctly identified by the program).

- **Case 2:** No ratings change, but positions out of order.
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    1600 1600
    1500 1500
    1700 1700
    ```
  - Expected Output: "unrated" (Correctly identified by the program).

- **Case 3:** Ratings unchanged and in order.
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    1600 1600
    1500 1500
    1400 1400
    ```
  - Expected Output: "maybe" (Correctly identified by the program).

- **Edge Case:** Same ratings but out of order that should be caught as "unrated".
  - Input:
    ```
    4
    2500 2500
    2000 2000
    2500 2500
    2400 2400
    ```
  - Expected Output: "unrated".

Overall, each potential case adheres to the logic defined in the problem statement. After testing, it appears that:

Correctness: **True**

### Reasoning for Decision
The logic implemented in the program covers all described scenarios effectively, indicating that the program outputs the expected results under the rules stipulated. Each possible edge case has been accounted for and tested through these examples, confirming the logic's correctness. Thus, "True" is determined as the correct answer for the initial problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of participants' ratings, followed by `n` pairs of integers where each pair consists of a rating before and after a round. It determines if any participant's rating changed after the round (`is_rated`), and if all ratings remained the same, it checks for at least one case where the ratings before the round are in an increasing order (to set `is_unrated`). The function outputs one of three strings: 'rated' if any participant's rating has changed, 'unrated' if the ratings haven't changed but there is an increasing case, and 'maybe' if the ratings remained the same and there is no increasing case. Overall, the function processes the ratings and provides an appropriate response based on the results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
