The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from user input using the `input()` function. The `map(int, input().split())` operation takes the input, splits it into separate strings, and converts those strings into integers for both `a` and `b`. The initial conditions state that `ratings_before` includes the value of `a`, and `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected, but `a` and `b` will now hold the input integer values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` includes the value of `a`; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
