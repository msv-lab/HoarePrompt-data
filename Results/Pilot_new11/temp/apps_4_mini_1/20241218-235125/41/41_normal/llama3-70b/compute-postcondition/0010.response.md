Given the provided initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, so it is [a, a].
- `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`, so it starts with [b].

Executing the code snippet:

```
ratings_after.append(b)
```

The effect of this code is to append the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. After execution, `ratings_after` will contain the value `b` two times if `b` was already present once, or it will just have one instance if it wasn't.

However, since `ratings_after` already includes `b` once based on the stated initial conditions, after appending `b`, it will now have two instances of `b`. 

Therefore, the updated values will be:

- `ratings_after` becomes [b, b].

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice, so `ratings_after` is [b, b].**
