Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False. If the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]` and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific action or state change occurs as there is no else part.***
