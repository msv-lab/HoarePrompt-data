The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of `n`, `i`, and `j`, along with the new value of `unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `unrated` is False**
