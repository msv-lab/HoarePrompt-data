The `ratings_after` list is being updated by appending the value of `b` to it. The values of `n`, `a`, and `ratings_before` remain unchanged, but now `ratings_after` will include the value of `b`. Thus, the output state reflects that `ratings_after` has been expanded with the new value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a`; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
