According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs for `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `j` will start from 1 in the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 because currently `j` is 2, and it needs to be less than `n` to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
