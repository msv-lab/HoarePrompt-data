The statement `unrated = False` is essentially reassigning the value of `unrated` to `False`. Since `unrated` is already `False` in the initial state, there is no change to its value. The other variables' states remain unchanged, and the information given in the initial state about their values still holds. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False, the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]`, and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`.**
