The variable `maybe` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \); `ratings_before` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `a`; `ratings_after` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `b`; `a` is the last input integer received; `b` is the last input integer received; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True; `maybe` is True**
