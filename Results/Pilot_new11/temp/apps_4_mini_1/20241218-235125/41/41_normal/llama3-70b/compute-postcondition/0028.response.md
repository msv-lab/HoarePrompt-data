Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
