Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False. If the `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part.***
