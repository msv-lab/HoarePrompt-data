The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the input provided by the user. Since they are both input integers, they can have any integer values based on user input. The previous state of `ratings_before` included the value of `a` twice, so it is `[a, a]`, and `ratings_after` included the value of `b` twice, thus it becomes `[b, b]`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` assigned from the input, and the updated lists for `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` is [a, a]; `ratings_after` is [b, b].**
