The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False.**
