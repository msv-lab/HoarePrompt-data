Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, and `rated` is True. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ratings_before[i]` equals `ratings_after[i]`, no change occurs as there is no else part defined.***
