To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop's termination condition, which is based on the variable `n`. The loop is set to execute `n` times, and if `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), it indicates that the loop can run as long as the counter has not yet reached `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is within the specified range, and we need to account for the current iteration to update the loop control variable appropriately. Since the loop uses the `_` variable, we don’t track its value, but we understand that it disregards the iteration index.

To execute one more time, `n` must remain the same while we also logically consider that the loop would have completed one iteration during the last run. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, it can execute as long as the current iteration count does not equal `n`.

Thus, if the loop has executed `n` times in total, it can't execute anymore because it has met its limit.

Since `n` had not reached its termination condition before the last iteration, we can examine it through the lens of `n` still allowing further iterations:

1. `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` do not influence the loop termination condition.
2. We need to decrease the logical count of remaining iterations correctly, but since we don't track iterations explicitly in the code, we assume the loop has executed at least once.

The key points are:
- Since this is the last iteration it has not yet reached `n`, thus for the next loop we need to ensure that `n` can allow one more execution.
 
Therefore, at the next loop execution, we maintain `n` as it is and do not explicitly update any additional states.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice, so `ratings_after` is [b, b].**
