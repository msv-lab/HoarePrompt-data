The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state specifies that `rated` is `False`, but since we are only updating `unrated`, we can keep it unchanged. The other variables remain unaffected as the assignment does not involve them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \); `ratings_before` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `a`; `ratings_after` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `b`; `a` is the last input integer received; `b` is the last input integer received; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True**
