According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `2` (which is `i + 1` since `i` is `1`) and continues until `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are: `i` is `1`, `j` is `2`, and `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `1`, making `j` equal to `3`. Additionally, for another iteration to occur, `n` must also be at least `4` since `j` will be compared against `n` in the condition of the loop.

Hence, the adjusted state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `unrated` remains True.**
