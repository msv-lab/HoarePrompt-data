Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `unrated` is False. If the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` holds true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition does not hold, the program continues without any changes to the specified variables.***
