Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', all having counts less than or equal to `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', then `counts` has reached `target_count` for all keys, and `result` contains the characters assigned up to index `i - 1`, with `i` equal to the number of characters assigned, ensuring that `n` is greater than `i`.***
