Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary containing counts for keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If `counts[char]` (which is `counts['C']`) is greater than `target_count`, the function returns None. Since there is no else part, there is no specific action or return value specified for the case when `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`.***
