Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the requirements of the problem description regarding the decoding of the mammoth's genome.

1. **Checking if n is a multiple of 4**: The program correctly checks if `n` is a multiple of 4 at the start. If not, it returns "===".

2. **Counting nucleotides**: The program counts occurrences of `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T` correctly. However, it does not consider the scenario where even if not exceeding the `target_count`, the total count may not meet the requirements when combined with `?`. Specifically, if there are fewer than `target_count` of a nucleotide type and plenty of `?`, the program only replaces `?` up to the limit but does not account for the total counts required across the nucleotide types.

3. **Replacing '?'**: When replacing `?`, the logic does not adjust for cases where there might be insufficient `?` to balance out the counts of the nucleotides. If there are more `?` than needed to reach the `target_count` for any of the nucleotides, the extra `?` remain unprocessed, leading to a situation where the genome could end up with unequal counts and thus not meeting the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Final Output Scenario**: The end output could potentially print a string that still fails to meet the equality condition for nucleotide counts, especially if there are enough `?` present but not appropriately factored in.

For example, consider an input like `6` and the genome `??G??`. The program might output `AGG??`, which does not meet the requirement since the counts are not equal, and the program wouldn't output "===" even when it should have identified that it was impossible to balance nucleotides.

Thus, while the program handles certain checks correctly, it fails to ensure that the counts of all nucleotides are exactly balanced with adequate replacement of `?`, leading to outputs that are incorrect in forms that cannot satisfy the problem description.
