The statement `counts[char] += 1` indicates that the count for the character `char` in the `counts` dictionary is being incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `char` is the first character of string `s` and that `char` is an element of `counts`, meaning that `counts` must have a key corresponding to `char`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it suggests that some iteration or processing might have happened prior to this code related to `s`, but we do not change `n` or `s` with this line. The character count for `char` in `counts` is updated from its previous value to one higher.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is an element of `counts`, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1.**
