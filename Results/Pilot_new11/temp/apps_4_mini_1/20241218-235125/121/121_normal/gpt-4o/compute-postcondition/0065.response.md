The operation `counts[char] += 1` increments the value associated with the `char` key in the `counts` dictionary by 1. The `counts` variable must have at least one character key, indicating that `char` exists in `counts`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `counts` has at least 1 character key, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `counts[char]` is now equal to its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`counts` has at least 1 character key, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `counts[char]` is now equal to the previous value of `counts[char] + 1.`**
