You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the total number of nucleotides, including the unrecognized ones, cannot be evenly divided by 4. This situation would make it impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide.

For example, consider the input:
```
9
A?C??GT?T
```
In this case, `n = 9` and there are 4 unrecognized nucleotides (`?`). The total number of nucleotides, 9, cannot be evenly divided by 4. Thus it is impossible to replace the `?` characters such that there will be an equal number of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').

The program does not check if `n % 4 != 0` at the beginning, which would allow it to immediately return `===` without further processing, hence missing certain edge cases where the genome can't be balanced.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `count` is a dictionary with the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on their occurrences in `s`. Characters in `s` that are '?' do not affect the counts, and therefore `count` only contains the total occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is updated such that for each character 'c' in 'ACGT': `count[c]` is equal to \( (n // 4) - \text{original count}[c] \); `avg` is equal to \(n // 4`.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` has been fully processed, `res` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `count` contains the remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after replacing all '?' in `s`.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` has been fully processed, and `res` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If there is at least one character remaining in `count` with a non-zero value, the program continues processing. Otherwise, if all counts in `count` are zero, `res` is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
