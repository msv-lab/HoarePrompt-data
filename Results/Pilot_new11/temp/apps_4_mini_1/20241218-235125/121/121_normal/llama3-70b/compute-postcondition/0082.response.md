Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'T'. If `count['T']` is greater than 0, the value of `res` is updated to concatenate 'T', and `count['T']` is decreased by 1, after which the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
