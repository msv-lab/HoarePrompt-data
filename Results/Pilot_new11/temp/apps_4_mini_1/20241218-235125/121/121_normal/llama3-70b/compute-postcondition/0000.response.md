The value of `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`. The original precondition states that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255. Therefore, after execution, `n` will still be within that range but could potentially change to any integer value that the user inputs within those bounds. The variable `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255 (updated to be a user-defined integer), `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
