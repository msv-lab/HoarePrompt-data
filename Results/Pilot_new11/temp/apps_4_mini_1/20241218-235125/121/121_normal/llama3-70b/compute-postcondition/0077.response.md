Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G'. If `count[nc]` was greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is now decremented by 1, `res` is updated by concatenating the previous value of `res` with 'G', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
