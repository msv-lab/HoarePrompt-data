Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` has been fully processed, `res` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `count` contains the remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after replacing all '?' in `s`. All counts in `count` are zero (i.e., there are no remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T').***
