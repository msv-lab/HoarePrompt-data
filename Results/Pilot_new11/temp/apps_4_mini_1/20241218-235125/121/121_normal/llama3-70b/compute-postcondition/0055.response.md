The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count[nc]` is decreased by 1; `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'A' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
