The code `res += nc` implies that the current value of `res` will have the value of `nc`, which is 'T', appended to it. The variable `nc` is not changing, but `res` is, by taking its previous value and adding 'T' to it. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'T', `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'T'.**
