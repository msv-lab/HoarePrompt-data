Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
