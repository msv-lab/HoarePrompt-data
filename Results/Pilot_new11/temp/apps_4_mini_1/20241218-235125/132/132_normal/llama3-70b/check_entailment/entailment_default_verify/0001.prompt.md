You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing and how it aligns with the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We have two sequences of piles of stones, `x` (initial state) and `y` (final state).
    - The problem states that we can either remove stones or move stones around, and we need to determine if the transformation from `x` to `y` is possible.

2. **Program Logic**:
    - The program calculates the total number of stones in both lists `x` and `y` and checks if they are equal. If they are not equal, it outputs "No".
    - If the sums are equal, the program sorts both lists and checks if the sorted lists are identical. If they are, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

3. **Critique of Logic**:
    - The program checks if the total number of stones is equal, which is essential, as removing stones lowers the total.
    - However, sorting both lists to check if they are identical fails to account for rearrangements due to movement or removal of stones. The final arrangement could be valid as long as the total count is maintained, but they needn't be exactly the same in sorted order.

**Counterexample to Identify Incorrect Logic**:
Consider the following case:
- `n = 3`
- `x = [3, 0, 0]`
- `y = [2, 0, 1]`

In this case:
- The sum of `x` is `3`, and the sum of `y` is also `3`.
- When sorted, both lists are `x = [0, 0, 3]` and `y = [0, 1, 2]`, which are not equal.
- However, we can obtain `y` from `x` by moving one stone from the first pile (3 stones) to the third pile (0 stones), making `y = [2, 0, 1]`.

Since the sorted lists being the same is not a necessary condition for the transformation between the two states described in the problem description, this logic breaks the core constraints laid out.

4. **Final Verdict**:
Given that the program fails for the aforementioned counterexample, it does not meet the problem requirements consistently.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no parameters directly; instead, it takes user input to read an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. If the sums of the lists `x` and `y` are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it proceeds to sort both lists. It then checks if the sorted lists `x` and `y` are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; if not, it prints 'No'. After completion, the state of the program includes the input integer `n`, and two sorted lists `x` and `y`, provided both lists originally had equal sums. Edge cases where either `x` or `y` contains distinct values with the same sum are considered, and in such cases, 'No' will be printed, confirming the lists are not identical despite equal sums. The overall functionality does not return any values; it solely outputs result strings based on comparisons.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
