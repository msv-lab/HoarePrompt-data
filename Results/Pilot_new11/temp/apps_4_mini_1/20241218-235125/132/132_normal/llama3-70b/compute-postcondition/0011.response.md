The code simply prints 'No' and does not change any variables. Therefore, all the previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on user input, `y` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on new user input with the sums of `x` and `y` still equal, and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
