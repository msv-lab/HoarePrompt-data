Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, and `y` is a list of `n` integers. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, if the sums are equal, `x` and `y` are sorted lists of `n` integers, and if `x` is equal to `y`, then both lists are identical. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then they are distinct sorted lists of `n` integers but still have equal sums.***
