The code takes an input, splits it into parts, maps each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The initial state specifies that `x` is a list of `n` integers, and after executing the code, `x` will contain the integers provided as input.

Since the input will change the values of `x`, the initial condition for `x` is no longer valid. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still represents the number of integers entered.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, and `y` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers where each integer is within the range 0 <= y[i] <= 1000.**
