The variable `operations` is assigned the value `1`. The initial states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range [1, 500]; `s` is an input string of length `n`; `operations` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range [1, 500]; `s` is an input string of length `n`; `operations` is 1**
