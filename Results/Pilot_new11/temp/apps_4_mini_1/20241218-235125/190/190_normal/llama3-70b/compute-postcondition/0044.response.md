Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (representing lengths of sticks) as input. It calculates the optimal length `min_t` that minimizes the total cost of transforming all stick lengths to that length, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the stick lengths and the target length. It performs this by evaluating costs for lengths in two ranges: from one less than the median length (the middle value of sorted sticks) down to 1, and from one more than the median length up to 100. The function ultimately prints `min_t` and the associated minimum cost `min_cost`. Edge cases include situations where the input list is already composed of identical values, and handling the cases where the median is 1 or 100, potentially resulting in empty loops if no valid `i` exists in the specified range. Notably, the function does not return a value but instead prints the results.**
