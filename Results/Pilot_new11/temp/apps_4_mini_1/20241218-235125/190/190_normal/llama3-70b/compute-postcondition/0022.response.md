The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `mid - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`.**
