The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The value of `t` is currently equal to `mid` (which is the value of `sticks[n // 2]`). Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `min_t` and maintains the validity of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value (where 1 <= n <= 1000); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of integers; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences of each stick from `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `t`.**
