You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Let's go through the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `sticks`.
   
2. **Finding the Middle Stick**:
   - It sorts the list of stick lengths and calculates the "middle" value `mid`, which it assumes will be a good candidate for the value of `t`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total cost to change all sticks to the length `mid`.
   - It initializes `min_cost` with this value and begins to check for potential values of `t` around `mid`.

4. **Iterating Around `mid`**:
   - The program looks downwards from `mid-1` to `1` to check if changing the stick lengths to these values results in a lower total cost.
   - It then looks upwards from `mid + 1` to `100`.

5. **Updating Minimum Cost and `t`**:
   - It updates the minimum cost and corresponding `t` whenever it finds a lower cost.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t` and the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
The program's approach relies heavily on calculating costs based solely on the median (or middle) of the sorted stick lengths. However, there are nuances regarding the definition of "almost good". A stick length `a_i` is considered "almost good" for some integer `t` if it meets the condition `|a_i - t| <= 1`. 

This implies that:
- If `t` is chosen as `k`, acceptable stick lengths would range from `k - 1` to `k + 1`.
- Therefore, all sticks need to fall into this range to minimize costs.

### Example Cases to Test:
1. **Case with Extremes**:
   - Let's take `n = 3` and `sticks = [1, 100, 100]`. 
   - The optimal `t` is likely to be around the lower end, potentially `t = 1` or `t = 2` (both would allow some sticks at 1 to be adjusted at minimal cost).

2. **Existing Almost Good Sticks**:
   - For `n = 5` and `sticks = [3, 3, 4, 5, 100]`, the program should ideally recognize that `t = 4` would require minimal changes.

### Output:
- In the first case `[1, 100, 100]`, the program may select a value `t` around the middle (which would not be optimal), leading potentially to a high cost not calculated correctly.
- In the second case with `100`, the program may fail to account for excessive outliers effectively since it is not strictly managing the range checks required for "almost good" conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to work correctly in every case because it does not check costs against the required "almost good" criteria involving ranges but rather simply iterates based on distances from a median point. 

Therefore, based on these considerations:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (representing lengths of sticks) as input. It calculates the optimal length `min_t` that minimizes the total cost of transforming all stick lengths to that length, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the stick lengths and the target length. It performs this by evaluating costs for lengths in two ranges: from one less than the median length (the middle value of sorted sticks) down to 1, and from one more than the median length up to 100. The function ultimately prints `min_t` and the associated minimum cost `min_cost`. Edge cases include situations where the input list is already composed of identical values, and handling the cases where the median is 1 or 100, potentially resulting in empty loops if no valid `i` exists in the specified range. Notably, the function does not return a value but instead prints the results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
