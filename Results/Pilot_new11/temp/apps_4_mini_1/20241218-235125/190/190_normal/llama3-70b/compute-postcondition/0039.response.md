The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` was previously defined as `mid + 3`, so `min_t` will be equal to `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is updated to the sum of min(abs(x - (mid + 3)), abs(x - (mid + 2))) for x in `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is `mid + 3`.**
