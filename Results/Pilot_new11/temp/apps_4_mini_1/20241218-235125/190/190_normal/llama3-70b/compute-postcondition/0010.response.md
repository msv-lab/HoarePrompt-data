Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 1, `cost` is equal to the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in `sticks`, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `mid - 1`, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
