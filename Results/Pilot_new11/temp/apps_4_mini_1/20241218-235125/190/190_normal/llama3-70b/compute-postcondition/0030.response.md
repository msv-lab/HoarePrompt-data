Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, and `cost` is the sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks). If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `i` is assigned the value of `min_t`, `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`, and `min_t` retains its original value. Otherwise, no changes occur to `i`, `min_cost`, or `min_t`.***
