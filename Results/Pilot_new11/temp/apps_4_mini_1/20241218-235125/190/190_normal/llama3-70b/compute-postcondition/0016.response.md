The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. Since the initial conditions state that `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`, the value of `min_cost` now directly reflects that computation. The values of `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `i` are maintained, as they are not directly impacted by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
