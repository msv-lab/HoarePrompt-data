Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), if `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is equal to `(100 - a[0])`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `length` is equal to the first element of the list `a`. Otherwise, if `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` and is greater than or equal to 100, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 102`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
