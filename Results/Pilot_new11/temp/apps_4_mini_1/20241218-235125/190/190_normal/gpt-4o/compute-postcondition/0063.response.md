Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `t` is 101. If `length` (the first element of `a`) is less than `t - 1` (100), `current_cost` is set to 100 - `length`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to 100, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 102` if `length` is greater than 102, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
