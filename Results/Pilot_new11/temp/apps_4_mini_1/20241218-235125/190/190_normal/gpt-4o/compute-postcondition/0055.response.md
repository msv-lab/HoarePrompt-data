The value of `current_cost` is assigned to 0, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101**.
