The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its existing value. Given that `length` is defined as the next element in `a` (element at index i + 1), it influences the calculation. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. However, neither `n` nor `length` affects the other variables directly besides `current_cost`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains mostly unchanged for `n`, while `current_cost` is altered based on its previous state and the expression evaluated from `t` and `length`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `length` is the next element in `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`**.
