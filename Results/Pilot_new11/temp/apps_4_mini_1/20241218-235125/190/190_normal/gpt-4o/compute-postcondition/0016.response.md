The code updates `current_cost` by adding the value `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. The initial condition states that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `length` is the next element in `a` at index `i + 1`, while `current_cost` is an updated cost based on the previous element's value.

Assuming we denote the previous value of `current_cost` as `previous_cost`, the new value of `current_cost` would be calculated as follows:

```
current_cost = previous_cost + (length - (t + 1))
```

The initial values of `n`, `length`, `current_cost`, and `t` remain valid after executing the code, only `current_cost` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `length` is the next element in `a` (element at index i + 1); `current_cost` is updated to `previous_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.**
