The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input string, split into separate components, to integers. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of n positive integers with each integer between 1 and 100. After the execution, `a` will contain n integers that are provided as input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] equals to the respective integers obtained from input, satisfying 1 <= a[i] <= 100.**
