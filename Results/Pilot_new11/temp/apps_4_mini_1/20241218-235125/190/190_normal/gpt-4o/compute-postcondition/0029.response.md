According to the code, the for loop will execute based on the variable `t`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to 100 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `t` has reached a value within that range (1 to 100). To execute the loop one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if `t` is 100, the loop cannot execute again, but if `t` is any value less than 100, it can execute one more time when `t` is increased.

Since `t` starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) 101, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be updated to `t + 1`. Consequently, `t` will need to be 101.

Given these conditions, we can say that for the loop to execute again, `t` must be 101. Since we've established that `n` is already within its constraints, it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101**
