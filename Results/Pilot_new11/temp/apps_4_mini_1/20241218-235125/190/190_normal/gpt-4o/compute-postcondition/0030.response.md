The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `current_cost` is now `0`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101**
