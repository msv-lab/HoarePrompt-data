In the provided code, `current_cost` is updated by adding the difference between `t - 1` and `length`. The initial state of the variables includes `n`, `a`, `current_cost`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `length`. 

- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
- `current_cost` starts at 0.
- `min_cost` remains unchanged.
- `best_t` remains unchanged.
- `t` is 101.
- `length` is the first element of `a` and is less than `t - 1`, which means `length` < 100.

The calculation for the new value of `current_cost` is:
```
current_cost = current_cost + (t - 1 - length)
current_cost = 0 + (101 - 1 - length)
current_cost = 100 - length
```
Since `length` is the first element of the list `a`, it is a positive integer which must be less than 100.

Thus, the output reflects the updated value of `current_cost` while the rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is 100 - `length`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element of `a`, and `length` is less than 100.**
