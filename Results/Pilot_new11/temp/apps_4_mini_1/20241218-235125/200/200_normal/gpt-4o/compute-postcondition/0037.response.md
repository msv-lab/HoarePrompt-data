The code snippet provided does not modify any variables but simply prints the value of `min_keg_volume`. Given that `remaining_kvass` is checked to potentially affect `min_keg_volume`, we need to consider the outcome based on the conditions outlined in the initial state.

The impact of the code:
- If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` would have been decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`.
- If `remaining_kvass` is not greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.

However, since the code only prints the value of `min_keg_volume` and does not change its state or return a value, we reflect the outcomes based on the conditions stated.

We must clarify the state of `min_keg_volume`:
- If `remaining_kvass > 0`: then `min_keg_volume` is `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`.
- If `remaining_kvass <= 0`: then `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output should represent the potential values of `min_keg_volume` based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; if `remaining_kvass` > 0, then `min_keg_volume` is `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`; else `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.**
