According to the code, to determine if the loop can execute again, we need to evaluate the conditions on `i` and `n`. The loop is dependent on `i` being less than `n` for it to run. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is within the bounds of 1 to 1000. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` 1. Additionally, `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to be able to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1**
