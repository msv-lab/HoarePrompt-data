You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic step by step and see if it handles all potential edge cases as required.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
   - We need to determine whether it is possible to pour `s` liters from `n` kegs (each containing a certain amount of kvass) while maximizing the amount of kvass remaining in the least filled keg.

2. **Identifying Key Conditions**:
   - If the total volume of kvass from all kegs is less than `s`, then it is impossible to pour `s` liters, and we should return `-1`.
   - If it is possible to pour `s` liters, we need to ensure that the remaining volume in the least-filled keg is maximized.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program takes input values, sorts the kegs by volume, and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible volume `low` that can remain in the least keg.
   - During the binary search, it computes the total kvass that can be poured if the remaining volume is set to `mid`. If the total is less than `s`, it adjusts the bounds of the search.
   - The condition `if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:` checks if the total poured can exactly equal `s`. If not, it returns `-1`, which is likely incorrect if it is possible to pour `s` liters while still maximizing the minimum remaining.

4. **Identifying Potential Issues**:
   - The logic after exiting the binary search (`if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:`) may not correctly handle cases where exactly `s` liters can be poured but results in `low` being incorrectly selected. This could lead to an incorrect return of `-1` even when pouring `s` liters is feasible.
   - Thus, the program's logic for the case where the total kvass equals or is greater than `s` fails to verify consistently, especially around the edges of `low` and cases where certain kegs are entirely full, while others contribute marginally.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - Considering an edge case:
     - Input: `3 4` with kegs of volumes `1, 2, 5`.
     - The maximum kvass remaining in the least keg can be `1`, potentially allowing pouring of 4 liters could involve emptying kegs unevenly, but the binary search logic may miss this as it would not capture scenarios where more kvass need to be extracted from kegs selectively.

Given this evaluation, I conclude that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of integers representing the volume of each keg where each value v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the initial values of `s` and the elements in `v` allow for multiple iterations, then the final values of `low` and `high` converge to the point where no further valid `mid` can be calculated that satisfies the condition, while the value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Any adjustments to `low` and `high` during the loop have ensured that `low` is now equal to `high` without exceeding the limits defined by the relationships to `s` and `v`.`
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum is equal to `s`, the value of `low` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of kegs, a non-negative integer `s` representing a target sum, and a list of integers `v` representing the volumes of each keg. It calculates the largest integer `mid` (referred to as `low` in the final state) such that the total sum of the minimum between `mid` and each keg volume does not exceed `s`. If this total equals `s`, it prints the value of `low`. If the total does not equal `s`, it prints -1. It effectively performs a binary search to find this value while handling edge cases, such as potentially returning -1 when it is not possible to achieve the exact total sum `s` through the available keg volumes. The function ensures that `low` equals `high` after the binary search concludes, positioned at the largest possible keg volume allowed under the sum constraint. The overall outcome is based strictly on the relationship between the keg volumes and the target sum, confirming whether the desired total is achievable.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
