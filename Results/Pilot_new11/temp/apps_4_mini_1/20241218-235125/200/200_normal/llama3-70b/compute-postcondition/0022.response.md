Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `v` contains integers such that min(v) > 0; `low` must still be less than `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high + 1) // 2; `total` is equal to the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
