Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. The value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. The sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` is equal to `s`. Adjustments to `low` and `high` during the loop have ensured that `low` is equal to `high` without exceeding the limits defined by the relationships to `s` and `v`.`**
