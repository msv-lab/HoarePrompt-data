Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `v` contains integers such that min(v) > 0; if `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid` where `mid` is calculated as (low + high + 1) // 2; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `total` remains the sum of min(mid, x) for x in v.***
