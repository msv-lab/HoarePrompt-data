The code provided only executes a `print` statement that outputs 0. This operation does not alter any variable values or states in the program. Therefore, the values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged after execution, and the printed value is not a variable that would affect the state.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers and the current value of `cnt_3` is greater than the current value of `cnt_1`.**
