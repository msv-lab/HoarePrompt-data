The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It has constraints on four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` which are ensured to be within the range 0 to 10^9. Since the expected output is not provided, we cannot infer the specific behavior or return values based on those parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function remains unclear without additional information regarding the output or processing involved. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and uses four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` which are constrained to the range [0, 10^9]. The output behavior is unspecified.**
