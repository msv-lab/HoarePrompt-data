You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, I will analyze the logic implemented in the function.

The given program aims to determine if it's possible to form a regular bracket sequence using a specified number of bracket strings. The counts of these strings are provided as `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`, representing the respective count of "((", "()", ")(", and "))".

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads four integers from input that represent the counts of the bracket sequences.

2. **Logic Implemented:**
   - It checks if `cnt3` (the count of ")(" strings) is greater than `cnt1` (the count of "((" strings). If it is, the program prints `0`, indicating that it is impossible to arrange the strings to form a regular bracket sequence. If not, it prints `1`, indicating it is possible.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

To determine the correctness of the implemented logic, let's consider the requirements for forming a regular bracket sequence:

- The number of closing brackets must not exceed the number of opening brackets at any point when traversing the sequence from left to right.
- Specifically, the number of ")(" strings (`cnt3`) can only be accounted for if there are enough "(( " strings (`cnt1`) to cover them, otherwise, it will result in an invalid arrangement.

### Potential Issues:

Let's analyze a potential example:

- If the inputs are `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 2`, `cnt4 = 0`, the program will check:

   - `cnt3 > cnt1` â†’ `2 > 1` is **True**.
   - Therefore, it will print `0`.

However, if we reconsider the arrangement of `cnt1 = 1` and `cnt3 = 2`, we would have:
- 1 (before we can use any closing brackets) and we must accommodate 2 closing brackets `")("`. In this case, it is impossible, but the code does not factor in the combination of all counts sufficiently. For example, if we had more empty pairs `cnt2` to fill in without mismatching the pairs, we could form a valid sequence.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly as it solely relies on the count comparison without considering the possible arrangements that could still yield a valid sequence with the empty pairs.

**Correctness: False**. 

The reason for this conclusion is that it does not cover cases where, despite having `cnt3` > `cnt1`, there could still exist enough openings to account for the closings when including `cnt2` in the arrangement which the current logic does not consider.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four non-negative integers from user input and compares the first integer (`cnt_1`) with the third integer (`cnt_3`). If `cnt_3` is greater than `cnt_1`, it outputs `0`. Otherwise, it outputs `1`. The function does not return a value or alter the input integers; it merely prints an output based on the comparison. The variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain non-negative integers in the range [0, 10^9] throughout the function execution. There are no conditions or logic in the code to handle any specific edge cases such as invalid input or numbers out of the specified range, as it assumes correct use according to the comments.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
