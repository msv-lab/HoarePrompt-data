You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the function.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to figure out if a regular bracket sequence can be formed using four types of bracket strings:
- `cnt1`: ((
- `cnt2`: ()
- `cnt3`: )(
- `cnt4`: ))

Based on the requirements for a regular bracket sequence, we note the following critical points:
1. The number of opening brackets must always be greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets at any point in the sequence.
2. The total number of opening brackets must equal the total number of closing brackets when the sequence is fully formed.

Given these points, the conditions for forming a valid regular bracket sequence can be mathematically summarized as:
- The total number of opening brackets (from `cnt1` and `cnt2`) must equal the total number of closing brackets (from `cnt3` and `cnt4`).
- At any point in a properly formed sequence, the count of closing brackets cannot exceed the count of opening brackets.

### Analyzing the Program Logic
The provided program checks if `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` and ensures that `cnt2 >= cnt3`.

1. `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` ensures that the total number of opening and closing brackets are balanced.
2. `cnt2 >= cnt3` checks that the number of complete pairs () is sufficient to counter the `)(` brackets.

### Test Case Evaluation
We will assess the correctness by considering edge cases:

- **Case 1**: All zero inputs (0, 0, 0, 0)
   - Expected Output: 1 (Regular bracket sequence can be empty).
   - Program Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Case 2**: Inputs leading to no possible regular structure, e.g., (0, 1, 0, 1)
   - Expected Output: 0 (Cannot balance).
   - Program Output: When inputs are 0, 1, 0, 1 -> Output is 0 (Correct).

- **Case 3**: Conflict between opening and closing brackets, e.g., (0, 0, 3, 1)
   - Expected Output: 0 (Too many closing without matching opens).
   - Program Output: When inputs are 0, 0, 3, 1 -> Output is 0 (Correct).

- **Critical Case**: Max input values:
   - Inputs: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000).
   - This checks if the logic breaks under large numbers. The logic will evaluate as follows:
     - Opening: 2000000000
     - Closing: 2000000000
     - Calculation: This meets both conditions so the output is 1 (Correct).

However, consider a case where:
- Inputs are (1, 0, 1, 1)
   - The expected output would be 0 because we cannot create a balanced sequence.
   - The program gives output 0 which is also correct.

Since we evaluated numerous edge cases including limits and conditions where the balance is violated, the program logic holds accurately under all scenarios.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the requirements, covering all edge cases effectively.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are integers satisfying 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9. If `cnt_1 + cnt_2` equals `cnt_3 + cnt_4` and `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, the output of the print statement is 1. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is 0.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
