Functionality: **The function reads four non-negative integer values from user input, named `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. It checks if the sum of the first two integers (`cnt1 + cnt2`) equals the sum of the last two integers (`cnt3 + cnt4`) and whether `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`. If both conditions are met, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any values, and the final outputs are solely determined by the input conditions without any additional state modifications to the input variables. It also does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid input types or values outside the specified ranges, which could lead to runtime errors.**
