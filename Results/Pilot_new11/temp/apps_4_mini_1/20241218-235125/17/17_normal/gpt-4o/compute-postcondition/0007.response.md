The code executes a print statement which outputs `0`. The values of the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not alter any variable state in the program.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are integers satisfying 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9; printed output is 0.**
