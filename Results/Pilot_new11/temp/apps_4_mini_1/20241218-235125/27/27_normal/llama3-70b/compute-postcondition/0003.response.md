The value of `a3` is assigned the result of the expression `(x ** y) ** z`, which can be simplified to `x ** (y * z)` due to the properties of exponents. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers in the specified range, `a3` will also be a positive real number. The variables `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged as they are still equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x ** (y * z)`.**
