Final: **False**

The original assessment of correctness fails to consider that the program, while it computes the correct values and outputs a corresponding expression, does not account for potential issues with floating-point arithmetic when comparing calculated values. The output hints suggest that edge cases involving very close values or rounding issues are not addressed, meaning that two different power combinations that are supposed to be equal might not be evaluated correctly due to precision errors. 

Additionally, the program does not explicitly handle or guard against any malformed input, even though it's assumed that input will be valid. The absence of these checks introduces a risk that may lead to unexpected failures if inputs were to deviate from the expected form, which although the prompt suggests will not happen, isn't guaranteed in practical scenarios. 

Thus, the initial assessment of the program as correct is not fully justified considering these nuances, prompting a final conclusion of **False**.
