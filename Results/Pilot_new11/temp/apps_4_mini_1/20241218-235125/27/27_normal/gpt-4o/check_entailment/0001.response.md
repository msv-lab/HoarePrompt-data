Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge cases where the calculations might involve very large values causing overflow or loss of precision in Python. For example, if we input values like `200.0 200.0 200.0`, one of the expressions, `x^y^z`, will result in `200.0^200.0^200.0`, which is an extraordinarily large number that could lead to `inf` in floating-point operations. The program does not account for potential overflow when evaluating these expressions, which could lead to incorrect results or cause it to fail in those cases.

Furthermore, it does not ensure that the output expressions maintain the proper order as specified in the problem description. If two expressions yield the same maximum value, the program will return the one that is calculated first in the list, but does not explicitly check for this scenario, exposing the program to possible logical errors if the input values are manipulated in a way that leads to multiple maxima.

Thus, we have uncovered cases where the program might not function correctly or yield the expected output, leading us to conclude that the program is incorrect.
