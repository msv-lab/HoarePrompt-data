The code creates a list of tuples called `expressions`, where each tuple contains a calculation involving the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with a string representation of that calculation. The values of `x`, `y`, `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point, which defines what these calculations will yield. None of the variables is changed by the execution, but the `expressions` list is created, containing various expressions.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, and `expressions` contains various power expressions of `x`, `y`, and `z` with their string representations.**
