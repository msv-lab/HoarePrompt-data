The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates based on three predefined variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are positive real numbers within the range [0.1, 200.0], each having exactly one digit after the decimal point. Since there are no conditions or output specified in the provided details, the output functionality cannot be determined accurately from the given constraints. Therefore, we cannot define a clear return value or case breakdown based on the output information provided.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output cannot be determined from the provided information.**
