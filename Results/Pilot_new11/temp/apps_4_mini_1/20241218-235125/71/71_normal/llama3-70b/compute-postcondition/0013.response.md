The function `func` has no parameters defined in its signature. However, based on the provided constraints and output information, we can infer the following:

1. `n` is expected to be a non-negative integer which can vary from 0 to 2,000,000,000. 
2. `k` is expected to be a positive integer which can vary from 1 to 9.

Output: The output of the function is not clearly specified in the instructions. Therefore, we focus solely on the parameter constraints and the type of output that might be expected.

Given these observations, we can conclude:

Functionality: **The function is expected to work with a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000) and a positive integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), but the specific output of the function is not provided.**
