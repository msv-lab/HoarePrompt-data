The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The variables `n` and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, and `count_zeros` has increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` has increased by 1**
