The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions inform us that `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, and `digit` is not equal to '0'. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `to_remove`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, `digit` is the last digit of `n` (as a character string) and `digit` is not equal to '0'.**
