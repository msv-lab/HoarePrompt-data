Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, if `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is updated to its previous value plus 1 and `to_remove` is updated based on the next digit of `n`. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is updated based on the next digit of `n` and `to_remove` is increased by 1.***
