The variable `count_zeros` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables, `n` and `k`, are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the previous values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `count_zeros` is 0**.
