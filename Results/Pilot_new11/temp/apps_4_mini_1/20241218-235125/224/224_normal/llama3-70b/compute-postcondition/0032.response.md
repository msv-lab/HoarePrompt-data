According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. To find the valid state to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `j` to be `f_max_n - 2`.

Since `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, this means that in order for the loop to execute again, `j` must be equal to `f_max_n - 2`, resulting in `j` being at least `0`. The loop will execute one more time if `f_max_n` is at least 2.

For the specific state values we need:
- `n` remains the same as it doesn't change in the loop.
- `i` remains the same since it's not influenced by the loop.
- `f_max_n` remains the same; it just needs to be greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` should be updated to `f_max_n - 2`.
- `dp[j]` still remains updated to `dp[j] % MOD`, hence thereâ€™s no change needed for this part.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
