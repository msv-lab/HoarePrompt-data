Let's analyze the provided solution based on the problem description, function implementations, and output hints.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to compute the maximum value of distinct GCDs for all permutations of the sequence from 1 to n. The final output should be the count of permutations that achieve this maximum distinct GCDs, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1: `func_1`**
    - This function correctly computes the GCD between two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
    - The function is straightforward and accurately reflects the input requirements.

2. **Function 2: `func_2`**
    - This function iterates from 1 to n to determine the maximum GCD of the values computed using `func_1`.
    - The logic intends to find the maximum GCD, but there's a misunderstanding in the implementation. The GCD of a cumulative result and a new number does not directly tie back to the distinct GCDs generated by permutations. 
    - The failure here is critical; the maximum returned by this implementation may not align with the problem's request for the maximum distinct GCD across all permutations.

3. **Function 3: `func_3`**
    - This function computes the number of ways to find selected sums resulting in `f_max_n` using dynamic programming.
    - The logic appears sound, altering through possible counts and correctly returning a count of valid combinations, thus aligning with the requirements expected from combinatorial counts.

### Examination of Output Hints and Examples
- The output hints accompanying `func_2` state that it finds a maximum value but do not clarify how this aligns with distinct GCDs across permutations. This remains the crux of the problem; permutations can yield various unique combinations not effectively captured through the maximum GCD alone.
- The maximum value derived from `func_2` cannot accurately reflect permutations' maximum distinct GCDs since it doesnâ€™t account for the way permutations influence GCD calculation.

### Verification Against Input/Output Examples
From the provided examples:
- For `n=3`, the intended output is `4`, reflecting permutations resulting in the maximum distinct GCD of `2`.
- The function `func_2` fails to yield this output correctly since it doesn't calculate permutations but rather just compares GCDs. This can be reasoned as `func_2` does not explore all permutation possibilities.

### Conclusion
Overall, the program does not correctly compute the result as requested by the problem statement due to the inadequate representation of distinct GCDs from permutations in the `func_2`. The failing test case example is:
- Input: `3`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Actual Output through `func_2`: Unclear but logically incorrect if it relies only on max GCD logic without covering permutations comprehensively.

Thus, the output of the code based on the analysis and clear discrepancies in functionality leads to the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**.
