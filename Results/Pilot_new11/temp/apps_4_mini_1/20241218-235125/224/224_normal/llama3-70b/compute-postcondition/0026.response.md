To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):`. 

The loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1 (not inclusive of 0). The execution of the loop depends on the value of `f_max_n`, which must be a positive integer. Since the loop starts at `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 in each iteration, it will execute if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Now, given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \) and must be at least 3.
- `i` is 3.

Since we do not have any information about `f_max_n`, we cannot assess whether the loop will execute based solely on `n` and `i`. Therefore, we need to assume that `f_max_n` must be defined to ensure that the loop has at least one iteration.

For the loop to execute, we require:
1. `f_max_n` must be at least 1, so that the loop can start.
2. `j` must start from `f_max_n` based on the range provided.

Assuming we want to specify that `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, we must amend the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`**
