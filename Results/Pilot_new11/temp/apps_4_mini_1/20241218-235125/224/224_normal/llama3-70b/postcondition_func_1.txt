The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes a maximum value by iterating through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` with a cumulative maximum value and the current integer. It returns the maximum result obtained from these computations. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, nor does it define the behavior of `func_1`, which may impact the final results. After execution, the final state of the program includes the returned maximum value generated by evaluating `func_1` across the defined range.
