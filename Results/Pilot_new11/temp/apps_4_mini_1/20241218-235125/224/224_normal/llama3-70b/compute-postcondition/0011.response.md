The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Since the exact values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are not specified but we know that `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` should already be defined, we can express the change in the state. 

Assuming the initial value of `dp[j]` is `x` and the initial value of `dp[j - 1]` is `y`, the new value of `dp[j]` becomes `x + y`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected: `n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, `j`, and the previous modifications made to `dp[0]` and `dp[j]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[-1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` (i.e., `dp[j]` becomes `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`).**
