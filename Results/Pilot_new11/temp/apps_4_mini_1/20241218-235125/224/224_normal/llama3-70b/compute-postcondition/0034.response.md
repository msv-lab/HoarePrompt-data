The code modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` was previously updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, the new value of `dp[j]` must be in the range of `0` to `MOD-1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects these updates.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and now `dp[j]` is `dp[j] % MOD`.**
