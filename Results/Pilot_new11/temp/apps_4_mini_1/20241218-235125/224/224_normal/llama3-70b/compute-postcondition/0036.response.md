To determine the output state after all iterations of the nested for loop have executed, we need to analyze how the variables change as the loops iterate.

Initially, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements remain 0.

The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and for each value of `i`, the inner loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`. The inner loop updates the `dp` array based on previous values.

After executing all iterations of the loop:
- For `i` from `1` to `n`, every index `j` in the `dp` array is updated based on the previous values in the same array, specifically leveraging the values from `dp[j - 1]`.

The final state of `dp` will reflect the cumulative counts of combinations of sums achievable with the constraints imposed by `f_max_n`. Specifically:
- If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to `1`, then `dp[j]` (for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`) will contain the number of ways to select sums of exactly `j` using integers from `1` to `n`.
- If `f_max_n` is `0`, `dp` remains unchanged throughout the operation (which means it will stay as it was initialized, with `dp[0]` as `1` and all other elements as `0`).

Therefore, the final output state would be a comprehensive statement reflecting `dp`'s final contents based on the conditions outlined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` for `j` in range from 0 to `f_max_n` contains the number of ways to select sums of exactly `j` using integers from `1` to `n`; if `f_max_n` is 0, `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
