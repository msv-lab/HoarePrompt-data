`dp` is assigned a list of zeros with a size equal to `f_max_n + 1`. The value of `f_max_n` is non-negative and less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the list will have a length ranging from 1 to `n + 1` depending on the value of `f_max_n`. The other variables retain their previous values without change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, initialized to zeros.**
