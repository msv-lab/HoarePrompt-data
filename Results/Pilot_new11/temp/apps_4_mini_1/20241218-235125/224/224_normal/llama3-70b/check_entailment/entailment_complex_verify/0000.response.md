Based on the analysis of the problem description and the provided annotated version of the program, I will assess the correctness of the program.

**Key Insights from the Annotations:**

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)** computes the GCD correctly. This function behaves as expected and does not have any issues relating to its correctness.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)** aims to compute the maximum GCD among integers from 1 to n. However, it does not correctly compute `f_max(n)` as described in the problem because it effectively just calculates the GCD from `1` to `n`, but we need `f_max(n)`, the maximum distinct values observed from the GCDs of the prefixes of all permutations.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)** is designed to compute the number of ways to achieve a certain sum using dynamic programming. While it may provide a mathematically interesting result, it doesnâ€™t correctly solve the problem of counting permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`, as prescribed by the problem statement. It does not leverage the GCD values obtained from the prefixes of permutations nor does it incorporate the concept of distinct GCDs or permutations themselves.

**Final Assessment:**
The program fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to improper calculation of `f_max(n)` and an incorrect understanding of how to adequately count based on permutations of integers leading to distinct GCDs.

Thus the final conclusion is aligned with the original assessment, where the program does not meet the problem description and the annotations support the conclusion that the program does not achieve the intended goal.

Final: **False**
