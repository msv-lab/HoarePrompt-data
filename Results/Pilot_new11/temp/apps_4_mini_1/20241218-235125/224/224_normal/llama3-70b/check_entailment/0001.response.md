To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we first need to fully understand the problem description and the program logic.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to find a function \( f(p) \) defined over permutations of integers from \( 1 \) to \( n \). This function calculates the number of distinct GCD values computed from the prefixes of the permutation.
2. We need to calculate \( f_{max}(n) \), the maximum value of \( f(p) \) across all permutations and then count how many permutations achieve that maximum \( f_{max}(n) \).
3. Finally, the result must be returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)** calculates the GCD of two numbers, which seems correct.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)** computes the maximum GCD value across the integers up to \( n \), but it does not seem relevant to determining permutations or counting them, which is a major component of our task.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)** appears to implement a dynamic programming solution to count permutations based on the maximum GCD value. However, it doesn't effectively map to how \( f(p) \) is supposed to be counted.

### Critical Evaluation:
The main problem with the program is that it lacks any concrete method to compute combinations of permutations and lacks a way to accurately determine \( f(p) \) and subsequently \( f_{max}(n) \) followed by the counting of valid permutations.

For example:
- If we consider \( n = 3 \), the expected \( f_{max}(3) \) is \( 2 \) and there are \( 4 \) permutations achieving that maximum \( f(p) \) value, as per the problem description. However, the implementation lacks a systematic approach to evaluate all permutations and calculate \( f(p) \) correctly.

### Test Cases:
Upon testing small values of \( n \):
- For \( n = 2 \), \( f(p) \) yields \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), we expect \( 4 \) permutations achieving \( f(p) = 2 \).
The functions provided fail to correctly implement the required logic for counting permutations that yield \( f(p) \) equal to \( f_{max}(n) \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly follow the logic of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not accurately create permutations or calculate \( f(p) \) to find the count of permutations that return \( f_{max}(n) \).

Correctness: **False**.
