You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. If `b` was initially 0, then the loop does not execute and `a` remains unchanged.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'a' and 'b', which remains unchanged as 'b' is 0 and does not affect 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, it guarantees that `b` will be 0, and `a` will hold the value of the GCD (or remain unchanged if `b` was initially 0). There are no additional checks or handling for cases where `a` or `b` is negative, but it is assumed from the comments that they are non-negative. The result returned is the GCD of the inputs, accurately reflecting the state post-execution of the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the maximum value computed by `func_1(0, i)` for `i` from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
    return res
    #The program returns 'res', which is the maximum value computed by 'func_1(0, i)' for 'i' ranging from 1 to 'n', where 'n' is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes a maximum value by iterating through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` with a cumulative maximum value and the current integer. It returns the maximum result obtained from these computations. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, nor does it define the behavior of `func_1`, which may impact the final results. After execution, the final state of the program includes the returned maximum value generated by evaluating `func_1` across the defined range.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` for `j` in range from 0 to `f_max_n` contains the number of ways to select sums of exactly `j` using integers from `1` to `n`; if `f_max_n` is 0, `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which contains the number of ways to select sums of exactly f_max_n using integers from 1 to n if f_max_n is greater than or equal to 1. If f_max_n is 0, it returns 1 (the value of dp[0]), indicating one way to form the sum of 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (with the constraint f_max_n <= n). It calculates and returns the number of ways to select sums of exactly `f_max_n` using integers from 1 to `n`. 

If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of combinations of choosing numbers that sum to `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function returns 1, representing the single way to form the sum of 0 (by selecting no numbers). The function maintains the invariant that the computed number of ways to form sums is stored in the list `dp`, indexed by possible sums from 0 to `f_max_n`.

The function’s logic ensures that valid inputs result in correctly calculated outputs, and it correctly handles two specific edge cases: when `f_max_n` is 0, returning 1, and when `f_max_n` is 1 or more, returning the calculated number of combinations. No missing functionality is identified that would impact the expected behavior as described in the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
