The variable `result` is updated to be `result * i % mod`. Given that `result` is initially 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is 1000000007, we can calculate the new value of `result`.

Calculating `result`:
- `result = 1 * 2 % 1000000007`
- `result = 2 % 1000000007`
- Since 2 is less than 1000000007, `result` remains 2.

The other variables `n`, `mod`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state maintains the conditions for `n` as well.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**.
