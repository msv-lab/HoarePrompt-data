The code `print(0)` outputs the value `0`, but it does not change any of the variable values or states. The values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an integer, `cnt_2` is an integer, `cnt_3` is in the range [0, 10^9], `cnt_4` is an integer, and the output is 0.**
