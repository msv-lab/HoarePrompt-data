The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. The parameter `digits` is a list of integers, each representing the digits of a number in the specified base, where each integer is in the range 0 to `base-1`. The parameter `base` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 40. After executing the function body, the function returns the number represented by the given `digits` in the specified `base`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers representing digits of a number and an integer specifying the base, and return the number represented by those digits in that base.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, where `digits` represents the digits of a number in the specified base, and `base` is between 2 and 40. It returns the number represented by `digits` in the given `base`.**
