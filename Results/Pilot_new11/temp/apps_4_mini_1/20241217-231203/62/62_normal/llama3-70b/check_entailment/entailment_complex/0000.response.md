Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the specifications outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two space-separated integers for the first number (X) and its base, and similarly for the second number (Y). This aligns with the first part of the input structure specified in the problem description.

2. **Digit Processing**: The program collects the digits of both numbers (X and Y) correctly according to their specified bases. It takes care to create lists of integers that adhere to the constraints given (0 ≤ x_i < b_x and 0 ≤ y_i < b_y).

3. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` correctly converts the list of digits from a given base to its decimal equivalent. The operation `result = result * base + digit` correctly computes the value based on the positional significance of each digit in the specified base.

4. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to their decimal representations, the program contains appropriate comparison logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine and print the relationship between X and Y ('<', '>', or '=') as specified in the problem description.

5. **Assumptions of Valid Input**: The annotations confirm that the program assumes valid input within the constraints given (valid bases and digits). Since the problem description indicates no leading zeroes for positive numbers and valid ranges for digits, the program's assumption is consistent with the input specifications.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases like the minimum and maximum bounds of the inputs (such as n, m = 1, and bases = 2 or 40) without crashing or yielding incorrect results.

Given the structure of the program, its adherence to the problem requirements, and the effective handling of inputs and outputs, I conclude that the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the output is deemed correct.
