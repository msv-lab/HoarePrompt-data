`decimal_value` is updated by multiplying its current value by `base` and adding `digit` to it. The initial state states that `decimal_value` is 0, which means after executing the code, `decimal_value` becomes `0 * base + digit`, simplifying to `digit`. The values of `digits`, `base`, and `digit` do not change. 

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the first element of `digits`**.
