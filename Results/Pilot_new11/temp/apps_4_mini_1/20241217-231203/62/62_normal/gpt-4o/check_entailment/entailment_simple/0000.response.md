Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of why it adheres to the description:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input for two numbers X and Y, represented in different bases. It first reads the count and base for number X, followed by its digits, and then similarly for number Y. This matches the input structure in the problem description.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The program uses the function `func_1` to convert numbers from their respective bases to decimal. This function takes a list of digits and the base, performing the necessary calculations to convert the base representation to a decimal integer.

3. **Comparison**: After both numbers X and Y have been converted to decimal, the program compares their decimal representations. It appropriately prints '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, or '=' if they are equal, in accordance with the requirements.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints given in the problem (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40), and manages the input correctly by assuming valid input based on provided constraints. The function `func_1` correctly handles lists of digits for ranges consistent with their bases (0 ≤ x_i < b_x and 0 ≤ y_i < b_y).

Overall, each component of the program directly relates to the required tasks specified in the problem description. It can handle different bases and compares the two numbers accurately when provided with valid input. Hence, the program is correct.
