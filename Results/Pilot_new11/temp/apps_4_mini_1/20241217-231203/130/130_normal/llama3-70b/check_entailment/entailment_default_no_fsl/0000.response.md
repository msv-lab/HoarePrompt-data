To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how it matches with the problem description and the output hints.

The problem states that:

1. Ivan has a total of `N` different collectible coins.
2. He currently has `K` coins in his collection.
3. There are `M` friends who want to gift coins to him.
4. At least `L` coins from these gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.

The output states that the program must find the minimal number of coins that one friend can gift while satisfying the conditions or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Analyzing the code:

```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

The condition being checked in the code is:
- `M >= N - K + 1`: This checks if the number of friends is enough to gift the number of different coins remaining after accounting for the coins Ivan already has.
- `M >= L`: This checks if the number of friends is enough to ensure that at least `L` new coins can be given.

### Potential Problems:

1. If `K` equals `N`, then `N - K + 1` equals `1`. In this case, Ivan has every unique coin, so no new coins can be gifted. This situation is not handled correctly by the condition because although `M >= L` can still be true (if `M` is large), it won't be possible to meet the requirement for new coins.
   
2. The logic only tests if there are enough friends to meet the quantity of different coins available and whether they can collectively gift at least `L` new coins, but it doesn't check the scenario if `M` is greater than `N`, which results in a conflict since there can't be more distinct coins gifted than those available.

3. The check for exactly how many coins to gift is overly simplified. The program decides on `1` coin without considering the potential need for more coins to satisfy both conditions comprehensively.

### Example:

Consider the case where:
- N = 10 (Total coins)
- M = 11 (Friends)
- K = 10 (Coins Ivan already has)
- L = 1 (Minimum new coins needed)

In this case:
- `N - K + 1 = 1`, hence M can meet this.
- `M >= L` is also true.

However, since Ivan already has all 10 coins, any number of coins gifted would not include new coins, yet the program will incorrectly output `1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided condition lacks the necessary checks and logic to ensure that the gifts can not only be different but also that there will be the required new coins given the state of Ivan's collection. 

Therefore, the program does not handle every edge case correctly, especially when `M` exceeds `N` or when all coins are in Ivan's collection. 

Correctness: **False**
