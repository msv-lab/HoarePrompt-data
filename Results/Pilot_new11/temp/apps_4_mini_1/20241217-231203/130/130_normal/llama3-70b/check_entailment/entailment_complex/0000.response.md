Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze why it fails:

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Ivan owns K coins out of N different coins.
   - M friends want to gift coins, and they need to ensure that all coins given are different.
   - At least L coins among the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

2. **Condition Validation**:
   - The condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` checks if the number of friends (M) is enough to gift at least as many different coins as needed and if they can ensure that at least L coins are new. 
   - However, this check is incorrect:
     - `M >= N - K + 1` means there should be enough friends to fill all possible unique coins after accounting for those Ivan already has, but it does not ensure that M friends can still gift all different coins if they can only gift at least L new coins. 

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The condition would lead to cases where the number of coins that could be gifted remains feasible (i.e., there are enough unique coins available), but the calculation does not directly provide the minimal coins each friend must give.
   - The calculation for how many coins can be given out optimally to ensure L new coins aren't properly assessed. 

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the provided test case `10 11 2 4`, the logic would incorrectly yield -1 when, in fact, it is possible that all 10 coins can be distributed (but not all to one friend).
   - The program does not calculate the minimum number of coins one friend should gift, which is what is needed as per the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to achieve the correct logic based on the requirements outlined.

Therefore, the function does not fully satisfy the requirements given in the problem description, and we conclude with the output:

Correctness: **False**
