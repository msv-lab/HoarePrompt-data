To determine whether the annotated Python program meets the requirements of the problem description, let's analyze both the program logic and the problem conditions described.

### Problem Conditions:
1. **Distinct Gifts**: All friends' gifts must be different coins.
2. **Minimum New Coins**: At least \(L\) coins in the gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.
3. **Equal Gifts**: Each of Ivan's friends must give the same number of coins.

### Input Variables:
- \(N\): Total distinct coins available.
- \(M\): Number of friends.
- \(K\): Coins already collected by Ivan.
- \(L\): Minimum new coins required from the gifts.

### Program Logic:
1. **Calculate `min_x`**: The program computes `min_x` as the minimum number of coins that each friend needs to give in order for all friends together to provide at least \(L\) new coins:
   \[
   min_x = \left\lceil \frac{L}{M} \right\rceil = \frac{L + M - 1}{M}
   \]
   This uses integer arithmetic to determine how many coins each friend should give such that the total from all \(M\) friends meets or exceeds \(L\).

2. **Check Distinct Coins Constraint**: The program checks if the total coins given, \(M \cdot min_x\), is less than or equal to the number of coins available after considering what Ivan already has:
   \[
   M \cdot min_x \leq (N - K)
   \]
   If this condition holds, it prints `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
Now, we evaluate if the logic implemented in the program adheres to the problem requirements:

- **Distinct Coins**: The program ensures that \(M \cdot min_x \leq (N - K)\), which means that the total given by friends does not exceed the number of coins that could be potentially new to Ivan. Hence, if \(M\) exceeds \(N - K\) while trying to give the same number of coins, it would indicate that not all gifts can be different, making it invalid.

- **Minimum New Coins**: The calculation of `min_x` ensures that the friends give enough coins such that at least \(L\) coins are new. 

- **Equal Distribution**: The method of calculating `min_x` ensures that each friend contributes the same amount (as defined by the result of the integer division).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic needed to meet all the constraints of the problem description. It smartly considers the conditions and outputs the expected result for the various scenarios as described.

Thus, the overall correctness of the program is validated as:

Correctness: **True**
