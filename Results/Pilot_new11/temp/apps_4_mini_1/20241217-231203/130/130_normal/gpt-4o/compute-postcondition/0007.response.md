Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are new positive integer values. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, then `min_x`, calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`, is printed. Otherwise, `min_x` is calculated and it is determined that `M * min_x` is greater than or equal to `N - K`, resulting in an output of -1.***
