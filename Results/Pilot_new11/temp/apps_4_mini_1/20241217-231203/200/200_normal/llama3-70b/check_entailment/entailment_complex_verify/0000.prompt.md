You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

1. **Read Input**: The code reads the number of kegs `n` and the required volume `s`. 
2. **Keg Volumes**: It reads the volumes of the kegs and sorts them.
3. **Binary Search**: It applies binary search to find how much kvass can remain in the least keg after pouring `s` liters.
4. **Check Feasibility**: It checks if pouring `s` liters is possible and adjusts the range of potential values for the minimum remaining volume.

Now, we should look for any potential cases where the program may fail:

- The program checks if the total from `min(low, x)` for each keg is equal to `s`. This doesn't account for the case where it’s possible to pour `s` liters but would lead to the lowest keg being not enough to satisfy the `s` liters requirement while still having equal possibilities for others. The logic can fail when calculating the total volume if the numbers are very large compared to `n`.

### Counterexample
Consider the following scenario to check if the program handles edge cases correctly:

Suppose we have:
- `n = 3`, `s = 6`
- keg volumes: `5, 5, 5`

The Fair Nut should be able to pour `6` liters, and one potential way to achieve that while maximizing the least keg is to pour `1` liter from one keg, `1` from another and `4` from the last one, which would leave `4` liters in the least keg. 

Following the execution of the provided program:
- The total will adjust based on the mid-value computed and assess against the intended `s`. The binary search may decide on a mid-value that seems valid, but it might not lead to the overall minimum keg being maximized post the pouring process.

The current implementation does not correctly assess the volume distribution pertaining to maximum leftover kvass in the least keg throughout the binary search iterations, which can lead to faulty conclusions. Hence, there might be scenarios that yield incorrect max values for the least keg after pouring `s` liters.

Given this potential case where the assumption being made about remaining kvass levels might be flawed based on insufficient checks after the binary search loop concludes:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v[i] satisfies 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest value for which the sum of the minimum between that value and each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. `s` is the input positive integer, `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `v` is the sorted list of `n` integers, and all variables reflect their final values after all iterations of the loop. If `low` was initially less than `high`, then the loop executed based on conditions on the total in relation to `s`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest value for which the sum of the minimum between that value and each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of minimum values does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `low` is printed, indicating that the sum of the minimum values is exactly equal to `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. It sorts the list `v` and then determines the largest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of the minimums equals `s`, it outputs `low`. If the sum does not equal `s`, it prints `-1`. Additionally, it implicitly assumes that the input constraints are met, and does not handle cases where `n` is zero or lists contain invalid integers, although such cases wouldn't occur given the specified input constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
