Postcondition: ***`low` is less than `high`, `min(v)` is greater than 1. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `low` is not less than `high`, with `total` updated to the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Otherwise, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is now `mid - 1`, and `total` is updated to the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v.***
