Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest value for which the sum of the minimum between that value and each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of minimum values does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `low` is printed, indicating that the sum of the minimum values is exactly equal to `s`.***
