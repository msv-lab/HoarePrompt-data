Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest value for which the sum of the minimum between that value and each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and the sum of the minimum between `low` and each `x` in `v` is equal to `s`.***
