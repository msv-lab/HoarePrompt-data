Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `i` is less than `n`, `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0 (or else no changes are made), `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s. `min_keg_volume` has been printed.**
