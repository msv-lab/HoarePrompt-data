The variable `remaining_kvass` is decremented by the value of `possible_to_take`. Since we know that `possible_to_take` is equal to `min(volumes[2] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, the value of `remaining_kvass` will be reduced by this amount. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but it's clear that `remaining_kvass` must now be a different value, specifically decreased by `possible_to_take`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `remaining_kvass` is equal to the previous value minus `possible_to_take`, `possible_to_take` is equal to min(volumes[2] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)**
