Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `remaining_kvass` remains unchanged if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, allowing the loop iteration to continue. If `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, then `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`, where `possible_to_take` is the minimum of the difference between `volumes[i]` and `min_keg_volume`, and `remaining_kvass`.***
