The `print(-1)` statement displays `-1`, but it does not change any of the values of the variables. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the output state is focused on the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`, and `total_volume` is less than `s`. Printed -1.**
