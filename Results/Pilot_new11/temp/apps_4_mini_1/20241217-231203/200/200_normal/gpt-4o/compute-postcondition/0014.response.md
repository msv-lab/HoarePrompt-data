The code `remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take` decrements the value of `remaining_kvass` by the current value of `possible_to_take`. The initial state indicates that `possible_to_take` is equal to `min(volumes[0] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, but the exact values of `volumes`, `min_keg_volume`, and `remaining_kvass` are not specified in this context.

Since `remaining_kvass` is modified by subtracting `possible_to_take`, the new value of `remaining_kvass` will be `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0 remains valid. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `remaining_kvass` and the unchanged values of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**
