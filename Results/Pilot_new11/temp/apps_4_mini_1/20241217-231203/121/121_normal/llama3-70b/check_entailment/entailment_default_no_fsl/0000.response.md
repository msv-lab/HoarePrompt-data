Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle scenarios where the number of unrecognized nucleotides ('?') is insufficient to balance the nucleotides to equal counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. 

For example, consider the input:
```
8
AA??CC?
```
In this case, we have:
- Current counts: A=2, C=2, G=0, T=0
- Average target count is `n // 4 = 2`.
- We need 2 Gs and 2 Ts to balance out the string, but we only have 3 '?' to replace.

The program would output `===`, which is correct since it's not possible to create a valid genome. However, if the input was:
```
8
A??CGT?
```
It would still output `===` suggesting that it's not possible because replacing '?' with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' characters is actually possible.

Moreover, for cases where there are odd numbers of valid characters leading to imbalance and ambiguous outputs, the program fails to check if it can distribute nucleotides correctly. 

Thus, it does not account for each potential case of imbalances due to the counts of existing nucleotides and '?' characters effectively.
