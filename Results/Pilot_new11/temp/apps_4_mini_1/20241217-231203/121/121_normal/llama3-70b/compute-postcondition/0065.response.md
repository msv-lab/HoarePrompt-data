Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` where `n` is greater than 0. If `c` is '?', the counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `count` have been updated after decrementing those used, `res` includes all characters that replaced the '?' and no remaining '?' characters are present in `s`. Otherwise, if `c` is a character in `s` that is not '?', then `count` remains valid, and `res` is updated to include the character `c`.***
