Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` where `n` is greater than 0; `count` contains valid counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', such that if `count[nc]` was greater than 0, `count[nc]` is now decreased by 1, `res` is equal to `nc`, and `c` remains '?'. If `count[nc]` was 0, the function state remains unchanged with `count[nc]` unchanged, `res` still an empty string, and `c` still '?'.***
