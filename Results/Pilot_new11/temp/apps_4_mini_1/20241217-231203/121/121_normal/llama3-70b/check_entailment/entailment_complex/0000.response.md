Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the decoding of the genome based on the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` is constrained between 4 and 255, which is specified in the problem description.

2. **Count Nucleotides**: It initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of how many of each type of nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') are present in the string. It correctly iterates through the string `s`, counting occurrences of nucleotides while ignoring '?'.

3. **Calculate Required Counts**: The program computes `avg`, which is the expected count of each nucleotide (given that they should be equally distributed). It then modifies `count` to reflect how many of each nucleotide are still needed by subtracting the already counted nucleotides from `avg`.

4. **Replace '?' Characters**: In constructing the result string `res`, the program iterates through `s` again, replacing each '?' with the appropriate nucleotide from the remaining counts. It ensures that if there are still necessary nucleotides (from the `count`), it substitutes the '?' accordingly.

5. **Output Result**: Finally, the program checks if there are any counts left that are greater than zero. If so, it correctly identifies that it's impossible to decode the genome suitably (as not all nucleotides could be made equal), and thus it prints '===' as specified in the problem description. If all counts are satisfied (i.e., exactly matching the requirements), it prints `res` which would be a valid decoded genome.

The program accounts for all edge cases within the input constraints, including:
- Cases with initial nucleotides already balanced.
- Cases where '?' replacements can fully encode to meet the balance.
- Cases where it is impossible to balance due to overly high counts of one nucleotide type that can't be compensated.

Because the program adheres to the specified problem requirements and correctly handles all scenarios, it can be concluded that the program is correct and follows the problem description faithfully.
