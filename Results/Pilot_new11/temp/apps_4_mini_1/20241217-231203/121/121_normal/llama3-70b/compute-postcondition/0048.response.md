The code `res += nc` appends the value of `nc` to the string `res`. The variable `res` is updated by adding `nc`, and since it is a string, the length of `res` will increase by the length of `nc`. The states of the other variables remain the same, but the contents of `res` will change to include `nc`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0), `count` contains valid counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, and `res` now includes `nc`.**
