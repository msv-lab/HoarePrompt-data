The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
