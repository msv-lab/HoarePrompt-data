The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it now takes a string input of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer indicating the length of the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is that `s` is now the string obtained from user input, while `n` still holds its previous integer value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` obtained from input consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
