The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `nc` to it. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` includes previously added characters, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' which follows the previous `nc`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has a new character `nc` appended to it while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT', and `res` is updated to include `nc`.**
