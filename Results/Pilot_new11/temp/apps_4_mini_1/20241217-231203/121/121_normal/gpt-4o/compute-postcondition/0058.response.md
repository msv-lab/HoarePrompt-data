Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` + 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains at least the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `result[i]` is a '?', and the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`.***
