The code snippet provided is a simple print statement which outputs a string '===' to the console. Since there are no modifications to any variables and the current state remains unchanged, the information regarding `n`, `s`, `target_count`, and `counts` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The current value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`.**
