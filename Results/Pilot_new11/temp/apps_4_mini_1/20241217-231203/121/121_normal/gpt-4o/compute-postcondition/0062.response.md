Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` + 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains at least the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, it is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.***
