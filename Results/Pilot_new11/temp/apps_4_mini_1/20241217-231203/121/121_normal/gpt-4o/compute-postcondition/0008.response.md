The value of `target_count` is calculated as `n // 4`. Since `n` is between 4 and 255 and is a multiple of 4, `target_count` will also be a positive integer. The exact value of `target_count` will depend on the specific value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `target_count`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, where `4 ≤ n ≤ 255`; `s` is equal to `data[1]`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.**
