Output State: **`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is {'A': count of 'A' in `s`, 'C': count of 'C' in `s`, 'G': count of 'G' in `s`, 'T': count of 'T' in `s`}. The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' will vary based on the distribution of these characters in `s`.**
