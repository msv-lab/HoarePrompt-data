The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `bottom_count[i]` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`d` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t`, `cntb` = `cnt_b`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the current value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count` is a list of `d` values where the `i-th` value is 1 and the rest are zeros, and `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists of `d` zeros. Otherwise, no changes are made to `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count`. `i` and `j` are either both 0 and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `i` and `j` are not equal and no changes are made. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`. The `bottom_count` list now has 1 at the `i-th` position and the rest are unchanged.
