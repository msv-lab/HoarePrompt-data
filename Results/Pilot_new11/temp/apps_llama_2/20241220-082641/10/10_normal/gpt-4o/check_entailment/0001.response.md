Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. According to the problem description, a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. However, the program only checks if the x-coordinates of the two cells of sofa A are both less than the x-coordinates of the two cells of sofa B, which is not sufficient.

A correct implementation should check if any cell of sofa A is to the left of any cell of sofa B. The same applies to the other directions.

For example, consider the case where there are two sofas: (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2). The program will incorrectly calculate the counts of sofas to the left and right of each sofa.

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the counts of sofas in each direction. This can be done by checking if any cell of one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of any cell of the other sofa.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly calculate the counts:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        cells_i = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_j = [(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)]
            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[0] < cell_j[0]:
                        right_count[i] += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[0] > cell_j[0]:
                        left_count[i] += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[1] < cell_j[1]:
                        bottom_count[i] += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[1] > cell_j[1]:
                        top_count[i] += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
        left_count[i] = max(0, left_count[i] // 2)
        right_count[i] = max(0, right_count[i] // 2)
        top_count[i] = max(0, top_count[i] // 2)
        bottom_count[i] = max(0, bottom_count[i] // 2)
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
This modified program correctly calculates the counts of sofas in each direction by checking if any cell of one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of any cell of the other sofa.
