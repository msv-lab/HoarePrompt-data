Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t` + 1, `cntb` = `cnt_b`, and `top_count[i]` is equal to its previous value plus 1. The values of `bottom_count`, `left_count`, and `right_count` are updated based on the conditions: if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count` is updated; if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented; if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is updated. If `y1` is not greater than `y2_j` or `y2` is not greater than `y2_j`, then no changes are made to `cntt` and `top_count[i]`, and the values remain the same as before the if statement.**
