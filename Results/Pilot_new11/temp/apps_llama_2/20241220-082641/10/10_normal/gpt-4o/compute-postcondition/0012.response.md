To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(d):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
```
The loop iterates `d` times, and in each iteration, it reads four integers `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` from the input, and appends a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the `sofas` list.

From the provided output states, we can observe that:

* After 1 iteration, `sofas` contains one tuple `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]`.
* After 2 iterations, `sofas` contains two tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`.
* After 3 iterations, `sofas` contains three tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`.

We can generalize this pattern to conclude that after `d` iterations, `sofas` will contain `d` tuples, each representing a set of four integers `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` read from the input.

The values of `n`, `m`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, and `cntb` do not change during the loop, so their final values will be the same as their initial values.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `d` is 0), the `sofas` list will remain empty, and the values of `n`, `m`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, and `cntb` will be the same as their initial values.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1 if `d` > 0, otherwise `sofas` is an empty list**.
