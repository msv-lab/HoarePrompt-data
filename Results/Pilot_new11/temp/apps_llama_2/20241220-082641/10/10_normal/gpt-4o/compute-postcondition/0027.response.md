Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t`, `cntb` = `cnt_b`. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, and `right_count` is a list of `d` values where the `i-th` value is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, no changes are made to `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count`, and `right_count`. `i` and `j` are either both 0 and we move to the next iteration of the loop, or `i` and `j` are not equal and no changes are made. `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.**
