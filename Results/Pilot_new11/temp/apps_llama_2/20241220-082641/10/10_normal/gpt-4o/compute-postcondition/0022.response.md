Since the code is `continue`, it doesn't affect the values of any variables. The `continue` statement simply skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t`, `cntb` = `cnt_b`, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `i` and `j` are both 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
