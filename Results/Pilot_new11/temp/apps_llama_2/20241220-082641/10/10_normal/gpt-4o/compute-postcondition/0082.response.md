The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not given any loop in the code snippet, let's assume it is part of a loop. 

When the `continue` statement is encountered, the code will skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. In this case, no variables are modified. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
