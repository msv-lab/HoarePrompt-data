The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left_count[i]` is unknown, but it is known that `d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 0th tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 0, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count[i]` is the incremented value, otherwise the current value of `right_count[i]` remains unchanged. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. 

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 0th tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 0, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count[i]` is the incremented value, otherwise the current value of `right_count[i]` remains unchanged, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.**
