The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with any loop in the given code snippet, we will assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It only skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas` where `j` is `d-1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
