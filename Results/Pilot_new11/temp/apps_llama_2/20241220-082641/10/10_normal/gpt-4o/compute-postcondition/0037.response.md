To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop statement is `for j in range(d):`, which means the loop will iterate over a range of values from 0 to `d-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, and `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers.
3. We are not given specific values for `n`, `m`, `sofas`, or the index `j`, but we know that `j` will increment by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Given that the loop is controlled by `j` iterating over `range(d)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `d`. At the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was some value, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- Since `d` dictates the number of iterations, `d` must be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`d` is a positive integer and must be greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is incremented by 1**
