Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

In the problem description, it is stated that a sofa A is to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. However, in the program, it is checking if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j to determine if sofa A is to the right of sofa B. This is incorrect because it is only checking if the x-coordinates of the two cells of sofa A are less than the x-coordinate of one cell of sofa B, which is not the correct condition.

The correct condition should be to check if there exist two cells a and b such that x_{a} < x_{b}, where a is a cell covered by sofa A and b is a cell covered by sofa B. 

A similar mistake is made in the conditions for checking if sofa A is to the right, top, or bottom of sofa B.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))

    cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d

    for i in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = sofas[i]
        cells_i = set([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)])
        
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]
            cells_j = set([(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)])

            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[0] < cell_j[0]:
                        right_count[i] += 1
                    if cell_i[0] > cell_j[0]:
                        left_count[i] += 1
                    if cell_i[1] < cell_j[1]:
                        bottom_count[i] += 1
                    if cell_i[1] > cell_j[1]:
                        top_count[i] += 1

        right_count[i] //= 2
        left_count[i] //= 2
        top_count[i] //= 2
        bottom_count[i] //= 2

    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b:
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break

    print(target_sofa)
```
This version of the program correctly checks the conditions for a sofa A being to the left, right, top, or bottom of sofa B, and it divides the counts by 2 to avoid double counting.
