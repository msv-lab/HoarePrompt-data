The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1**
