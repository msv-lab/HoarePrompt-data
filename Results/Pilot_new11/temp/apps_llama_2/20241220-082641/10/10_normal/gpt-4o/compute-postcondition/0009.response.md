According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If the loop has executed 1 time, then the loop can execute again if `d` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `d` must be greater than 1, and the integers `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` must be less than or equal to `d` - 1 which is at least 1.
State: **`d` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1**
