Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the `i-th` tuple in `sofas`, `right_count[d+1]`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 0, and if `i` is 0, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop if there are more iterations, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
