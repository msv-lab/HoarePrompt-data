To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state is:
- `d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`,
- `n` is an input integer,
- `m` is an input integer,
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers,
- `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2,
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`.

The given code snippet is:
```python
right_count[i] += 1
```

This code increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can see that:
- The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are not changed by the code snippet.
- The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that the value of `right_count` at some index `i` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the output state, considering all information provided and the effects of the code, is:
- `d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`,
- `n` is an input integer,
- `m` is an input integer,
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers,
- `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2,
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`,
- The value of `right_count` at index `i` is increased by 1.

Since `right_count` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, and their relationship or initial values are not specified, the most accurate description of the change is that the value of `right_count` at some index `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`, and the value of `right_count` at index `i` has been incremented by 1.**
