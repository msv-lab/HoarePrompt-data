The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` equals `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `d` is still a positive integer, `n` and `m` are still input integers, `sofas` is still a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are still the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are still the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, and `i` still equals `d`, `j` still equals 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is still incremented by 1 if it was the case, otherwise, it remains the same. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals `d`, `j` equals 1, `left_count[d]` is incremented by 1, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `right_count[d]` is the same**
