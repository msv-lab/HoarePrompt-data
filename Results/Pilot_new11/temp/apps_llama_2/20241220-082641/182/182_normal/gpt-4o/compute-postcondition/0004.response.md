The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it is influenced by an external integer `x`, where `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`, representing the camera angle in degrees. The function returns a value based on the camera angle `x`. However, the specific return values are not provided in the problem statement. 

To follow the format and provide a meaningful answer, we must infer that the function's purpose is related to the camera angle. Given the lack of specific return values, let's assume the function's output could indicate the direction of the camera rotation or validate the input angle.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but is influenced by an external integer x representing the camera angle in degrees and returns a value based on this angle.**
