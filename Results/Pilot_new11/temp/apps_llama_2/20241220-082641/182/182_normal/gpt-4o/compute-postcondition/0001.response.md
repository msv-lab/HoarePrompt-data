To calculate the result, we need to understand what the given code snippet does. The code `normalized_angle = x % 360` calculates the remainder of the division of `x` by 360 and assigns this value to `normalized_angle`. This effectively normalizes the camera angle to a value between -360 and 360 (excluding 360), because the remainder of any integer division by 360 will always be less than 360 and greater than or equal to -360 (since we can add or subtract 360 from the divisor as many times as needed to bring the dividend into this range).

However, since the range of `x` is between -10^18 and 10^18, and we're looking at the modulus with 360, `normalized_angle` will indeed be between -359 and 359, inclusive, because `x % 360` will cycle through these values as `x` varies.

Given that `x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, with positive values denoting clockwise rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation, and considering the modulus operation, the value of `normalized_angle` will also represent the effective rotation in the range of -359 to 359 degrees.

Therefore, the output state is that `x` remains an integer representing the original camera angle in degrees, and `normalized_angle` is an integer between -359 and 359, denoting the normalized camera rotation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, and `normalized_angle` is an integer between -359 and 359, inclusive, representing the normalized camera rotation, calculated as x % 360**
