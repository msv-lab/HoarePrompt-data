The code snippet provided sorts the list `times` in ascending order. 

The initial state includes the following variables and their respective values:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

The sorting operation only affects the `times` variable. The `times` list is sorted in ascending order, but its original value is still the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`. The other variables are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
