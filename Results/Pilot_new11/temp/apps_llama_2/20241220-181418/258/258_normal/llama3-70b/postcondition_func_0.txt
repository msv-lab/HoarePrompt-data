This function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane, represented by the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y). The function accepts four real number parameters and returns a real number value representing the distance between these points. It handles all possible real number inputs for x, y, X, and Y, including negative numbers and zero, and returns a non-negative real number as the distance. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs will always be real numbers. The function does not modify the input variables x, y, X, and Y, as they are passed by value and used only for the calculation. In cases where the input points are the same (i.e., x == X and y == Y), the function returns 0.0, representing a distance of zero between the points.
