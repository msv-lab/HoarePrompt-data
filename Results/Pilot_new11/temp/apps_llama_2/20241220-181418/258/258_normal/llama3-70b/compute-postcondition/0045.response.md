The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for all possible combinations of `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, where `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), and `N` is a positive integer. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to return the minimum time value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function returns the minimum time value from the times list at index K-1, considering all possible coordinates (x, y) and a positive integer K between 1 and N.**
