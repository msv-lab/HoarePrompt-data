The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` is initially the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, and `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, the new value of `ans` will still be the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, but now it is specifically compared with `times[K - 1]` where `K` is the current value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000 and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
