To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code reassigns the value of `times` by calling the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Given:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is `times[K - 1]`
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

The function call `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` simplifies to `times = func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we know that `times` will be updated to the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.

The states of `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `times` changes, the value of `ans` (which is `times[K - 1]`) could potentially change if the new `times` list has a different value at index `K - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]` based on the new `times`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.**
