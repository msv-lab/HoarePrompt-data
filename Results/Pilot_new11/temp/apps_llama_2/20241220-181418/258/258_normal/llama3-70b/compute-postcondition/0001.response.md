According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `K` and `N` because it is a fixed range from -1000 to 1000. The loop variable `x` will take on values from -1000 to 1000.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `x` is -1000**
