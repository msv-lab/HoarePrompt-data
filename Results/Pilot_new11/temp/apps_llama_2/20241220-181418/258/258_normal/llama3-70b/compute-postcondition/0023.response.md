The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Given that `ans` is initially the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]`, and now it's updated to be the minimum of this previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]`, the value of `ans` remains the minimum of all these values. 

Since `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `times[K - 1]` refers to an element within the `times` array. The exact value of `times[K - 1]` depends on the output of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, but since `times` is sorted, `times[K - 1]` will be one of the values returned by `func_2`, in sorted order.

The states of `K`, `N`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
