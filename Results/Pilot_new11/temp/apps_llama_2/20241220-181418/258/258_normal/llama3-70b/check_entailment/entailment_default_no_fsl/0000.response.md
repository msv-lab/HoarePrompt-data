Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not fulfill the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.

One of the main issues is with `func_2(x, y, X, Y)`. This function is expected to calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be ready, given the coordinates of the heat source and the piece of meat. However, it uses a variable `meats` which is not defined within the function or passed as an argument. It seems that the function should be calculating the time required for the piece of meat at position `(x, y)` with a hardness `c`, but instead, it is iterating over all pieces of meat in the `meats` list.

Furthermore, `func_3()` only checks integer coordinates for the heat source, whereas the problem statement allows real number coordinates. This could lead to the function missing the optimal position of the heat source if it's not an integer coordinate.

Additionally, `func_3()` calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, which calculates the time required for each piece of meat with the heat source at the same position as the piece of meat. This is not the intended behavior according to the problem description. The function should be calculating the time required for each piece of meat with the heat source at the given position `(x, y)`, not at the same position as each piece of meat.

Lastly, `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` also has an issue with the calculation. It seems that it should calculate the time required for the piece of meat at position `(x, y)` with the heat source at position `(X, Y)`, but instead, it calculates the time required for all pieces of meat in the `meats` list with the heat source at position `(X, Y)`.

All these issues indicate that the program does not fulfill the requirements in the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**. 

A correct implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` should be as follows:
```python
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)

def func_2(meats, X, Y):
    return [c * func_1(x, y, X, Y) for (x, y, c) in meats]
```
Then `func_3` should be modified to correctly use `func_2` and to search over a finer grid of points to account for the possibility of non-integer coordinates for the heat source.

Here is an updated `func_3` that uses the above `func_1` and `func_2` and searches over a finer grid of points:
```python
import numpy as np

def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in np.arange(-1000, 1001, 0.1):
        for y in np.arange(-1000, 1001, 0.1):
            times = func_2(meats, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans
```
