The original assessment states that the program is incorrect. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 

One of the main issues mentioned in the original assessment is that the function `func_2` does not correctly calculate the time for each piece of meat to be ready. In the provided code, `func_2` takes `x` and `y` as arguments but uses the global `meats` list, which is incorrect. It should use the `x` and `y` of each meat.

Another issue is that the program tries all possible integer coordinates for the heat source, but the problem states that the coordinates can be real numbers, not just integers. This approach will not find the optimal solution in all cases.

The annotated version of the code also highlights these issues. For example, in the annotated version of `func_2`, it is mentioned that the function uses a variable `meats` which is not defined within the function or passed as an argument. This is a clear indication that the function is not correctly implemented.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, it seems that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described, and the issues mentioned in the original assessment are still present in the annotated version of the code.

The correct implementation provided at the end of the problem description uses the `minimize` function from `scipy` to find the optimal position of the heat source, which is a more suitable approach for this problem.

Final: **False**
