To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over a range of `y` values from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive, given the `range(-1000, 1001)`).

Given state:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000
- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1000
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`

For the loop to execute, it depends on the range defined in the loop, which is `range(-1000, 1001)`. This means `y` will start from -1000 and go up to 1000. 

Before the loop starts, to ensure it can execute, we consider:
- The value of `y` before the loop starts is given as 1000, but for the loop to start executing, `y` should be -1000 (the starting point of the range).
- The other variables (`K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `times`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start executing since the loop iterates based solely on the `y` values in the given range.

Thus, adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we consider the initial value of `y` needs to be -1000 for the loop to start, and the rest of the state remains relevant as given, without needing adjustments for the loop's execution.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
