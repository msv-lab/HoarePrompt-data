Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[4]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[1]`; otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[1]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[4]`, and the values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on the calculations performed based on the `meats` list and the conditions specified**.
