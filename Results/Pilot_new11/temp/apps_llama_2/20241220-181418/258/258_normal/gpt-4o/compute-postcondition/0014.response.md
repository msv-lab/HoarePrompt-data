To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `K` is an integer
- `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`
- `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`
- `c` is an integer
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is 5
- `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, c)`

Given code:
```python
c = int(data[index + 2])
```

Since `index` is 5, `index + 2` equals 7. Therefore, the value of `c` will be set to the integer value of `data[7]`.

The affected variable here is `c`, which will now hold the integer value of the string at index 7 in the `data` list.

Other variables (`N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, `data`, `index`, and `meats`) are not changed by this operation.

However, note that the tuple in `meats` still contains the old value of `c`, not the new one, because the list `meats` is not updated in the given code snippet.

So, the updated state is:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `K` is an integer
- `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`
- `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`
- `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is 5
- `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, c)` where `c` in the tuple is the old value of `c`, not the newly updated one.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, old_c)`**
