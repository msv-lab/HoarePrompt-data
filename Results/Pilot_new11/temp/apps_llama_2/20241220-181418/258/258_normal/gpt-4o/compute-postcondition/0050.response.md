To determine the output state after the given code is executed, we'll analyze the impact of the code on the program, considering the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is at most 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `meats` is a list of triples.
- `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are the values of the triple at index `i` in `meats`.

Given Code:
```python
x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
```

Since `j` is 3, this code assigns the values of the triple at index 3 in the `meats` list to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively. 

The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the given code. The new variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are introduced with values from `meats[j]`, where `j = 3`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are the values of the triple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the values of the triple at index `j` (which is 3) in `meats`**
