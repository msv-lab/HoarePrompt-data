The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not modify any variables. 

Given the initial state, all the variables retain their values: `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition. Since `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and its current value is less than 0, we know that `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`. The `continue` statement does not change any of these conditions.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and is less than 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
