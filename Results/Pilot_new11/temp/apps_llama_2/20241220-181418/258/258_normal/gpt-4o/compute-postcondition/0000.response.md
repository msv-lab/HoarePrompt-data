To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The given code is:
```python
data = input().split()
```
In the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 60
- `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` and `data[1]` can be converted to integers `N` and `K`, and the rest of `data` can be converted to a list of 3-tuples `(x, y, c)` where `x`, `y`, and `c` can be converted to integers between -1000 and 1000, -1000 and 1000, and 1 and 100 respectively.

After executing the code:
- The `input()` function accepts a line of input from the user, which is then split into a list of strings using the `split()` method. By default, `split()` separates the string at spaces.
- The result of `input().split()` is assigned to the variable `data`.
- The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code.
- The new value of `data` is a list of strings where each string represents a part of the user's input separated by spaces.

Since the initial `data` was based on specific conversions and the new `data` is directly from user input, we can't assume the same structure without specific input. However, we know that `data` now holds a list of strings as input by the user.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 60, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, and `data` is a list of strings from user input**
