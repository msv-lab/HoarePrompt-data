The code increments the value of `index` by 3. The initial value of `index` is 5, so the new value of `index` is 8.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `N` is still an integer greater than 1, `K` is still an integer, `x` is still an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is still an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is still an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is still a list of strings, and `meats` is still a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 8, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`**
