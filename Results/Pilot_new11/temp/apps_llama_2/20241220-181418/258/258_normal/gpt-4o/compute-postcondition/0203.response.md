To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified.
   - `K` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is a positive real number.
   - `N` is greater than 5.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 5.
   - The condition `if c1 * T < c2 * T` determines whether the values of the triples at `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` are swapped.
   - `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
   - `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
   - `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
   - `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
   - `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
   - `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
   - `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   - The code given is `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `my` based on previously defined variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.
   - The calculation of `my` depends on the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`, which in turn depend on `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `c1`, `c2`, and `T`.
   - The swapping condition (`if c1 * T < c2 * T`) affects the values of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` but does not directly impact the calculation of `my`.
   - The state of `meats[0]`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the given code.

3. **Output State**:
   - Given that `my` is calculated based on `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`, and considering that these values are dependent on the original positions and values within the `meats` list and other variables, the value of `my` will be `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   - The state of other variables (`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`) remains as defined initially, with the understanding that `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` may have been swapped based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`.
   - Since `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, this specific value for `my` is added to the output state.

**Output State**: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified and `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` possibly swapped based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
