The given code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[index + 1])` to `y`. Given the initial state, `index` is 2, so `y` will be assigned the value of `int(data[3])`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, 
`K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, 
`x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, 
`data` is a list of strings from user input, 
`meats` is an empty list, 
`index` is 2, 
`y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`.**
