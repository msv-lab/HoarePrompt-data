The code calculates `dx` as `(x1 - x2) / 2`. This introduces a new variable `dx` and does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is less than `K`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
