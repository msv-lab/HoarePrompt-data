Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of all `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` â‰¤ `T` for `(x, y, c)` in `meats`, and if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns a boolean value True; otherwise, no value is returned, with the program state unchanged as the loop iteration does not proceed due to `d * d2` not being greater than `d2`.**
