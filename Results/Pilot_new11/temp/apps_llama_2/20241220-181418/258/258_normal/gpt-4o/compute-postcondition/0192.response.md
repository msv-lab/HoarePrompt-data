The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since we don't have any loop information provided in the initial state or the code snippet, we will consider its general behavior.

The variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the `continue` statement as it does not modify any variables; it merely controls the flow of the program.

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged. `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, where `c1` and `c2` are values from the potentially swapped triples at `meats[2]` and `meats[5]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
