The code `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` updates the value of `dy`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are calculated based on the last iteration, `count` is either the final sum or the value leading to early return if `count >= K`, and `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`**
