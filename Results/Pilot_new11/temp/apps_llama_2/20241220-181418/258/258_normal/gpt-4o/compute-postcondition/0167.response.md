The values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are updated to be the triple at `meats[j]`. The value of `j` is 4, so `x2`, `y2`, `c2` become the values of the triple at `meats[4]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`x2` is updated to `meats[4][0]`, `y2` is updated to `meats[4][1]`, `c2` is updated to `meats[4][2]`. 

`d` is `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)`, where `c2` is now `meats[4][2]`. 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, where `x2` is now `meats[4][0]`.
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, where `y2` is now `meats[4][1]`.
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, where `x2` is now `meats[4][0]`.
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, where `y2` is now `meats[4][1]`.
`d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, where `x2` is now `meats[4][0]` and `y2` is now `meats[4][1]`.
`mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
`my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
