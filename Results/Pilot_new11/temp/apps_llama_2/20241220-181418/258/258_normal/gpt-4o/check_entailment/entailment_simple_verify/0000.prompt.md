You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program provided attempts to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the minimum time required to cook K or more pieces of meat. However, there is a flaw in the program.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the midpoint and checks if there are at least K pieces of meat that can be cooked within the given time. The calculation of the midpoint is based on the assumption that the heat source is placed at the midpoint of the line segment connecting two pieces of meat. However, this assumption is not always valid.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Suppose we have three pieces of meat at locations (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1) with hardness 1, 1, and 1 respectively. We want to cook at least 2 pieces of meat. If we place the heat source at the origin (0, 0), we can cook the first two pieces of meat within 1 unit of time. However, the program will not be able to find this solution because it only checks the midpoints of the line segments connecting pairs of pieces of meat.

In this case, the program will not be able to find the optimal solution, which is to place the heat source at the origin. This is because the program's search space is limited to the midpoints of the line segments, and it does not consider other possible locations for the heat source.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and a more sophisticated approach is needed to solve this problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
