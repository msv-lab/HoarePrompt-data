You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of triples, where each triple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat, K is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready, and T is a positive real number representing the maximum allowed time.

            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of triples potentially rearranged based on hardness and time conditions, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of pieces of meat, `i` equals `N-1`, `j` has iterated over its range, and other variables (`x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`) have values determined by the last iteration of the loop or early return conditions.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a certain condition is met regarding the readiness of meat pieces based on their hardness, coordinates, and a given time threshold. It accepts a list of meat pieces `meats`, where each piece is represented by a triple of integers (x-coordinate, y-coordinate, hardness), an integer `K` representing the minimum number of pieces to be considered ready, and a real number `T` representing the maximum allowed time. The function iterates over pairs of meat pieces, calculates various geometric and temporal conditions, and checks if the count of pieces that meet a specific distance condition from a calculated point is greater than or equal to `K`. If this condition is met at any point during the iteration, the function returns `True`. If the condition is not met after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`, indicating that the minimum number of meat pieces are not ready within the given time threshold. The function's return value indicates whether the minimum readiness condition is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`), without modifying the original list of meat pieces or other input parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat required to be ready, and meats is a list of lists where each sublist contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is a list of lists, `low` and `high` have converged to within `1e-07` of each other, with `high - low <= 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns `high`, a value that has converged with `low` to within a precision of `1e-07` or less.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N` (an integer representing the number of pieces of meat), `K` (an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat required to be ready), and `meats` (a list of lists where each sublist contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat). It then performs a binary search to converge on a value `high` within a precision of `1e-07` or less, utilizing a helper function `func_1` to determine the convergence criteria based on `meats`, `K`, and the current mid-value. The final state of the program after execution is the return of `high`, which represents the converged value. The function does not modify the input parameters `N`, `K`, or `meats`. The purpose of the function appears to be finding a threshold value related to the readiness of the pieces of meat, as determined by `func_1`, with the given constraints. The function handles potential edge cases by ensuring convergence within a specified precision, but the logic of `func_1` and its impact on the convergence is not detailed in the provided annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer between 1 and 60, K is a positive integer between 1 and N, and data is a list of strings where data[0] and data[1] can be converted to integers N and K, and the rest of the data can be converted to a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) where x, y, and c can be converted to integers between -1000 and 1000, -1000 and 1000, and 1 and 100 respectively.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers extracted from the `data` list, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, and `data` is a list of strings from user input.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, parses it into integers N, K, and a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c), then calls another function `func_2` with these parameters and prints the result. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the parsed integers N and K, and the list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) from the input, and the result of `func_2(N, K, meats)` will be printed to the console with six decimal places. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer input, or input that does not match the expected format. If the input is malformed, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results. The function also does not check if the integers N, K, x, y, and c are within the expected ranges, which could lead to further errors if `func_2` relies on these ranges.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
