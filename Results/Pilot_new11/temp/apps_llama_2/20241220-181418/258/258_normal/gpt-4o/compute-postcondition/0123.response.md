The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since we are not provided with the loop that this `continue` statement is a part of, we can infer that the loop will move on to the next iteration. 

No changes are made to the variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, or `d`. The values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` also remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[4]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[1]`; otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[1]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[4]`, and `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on the calculations performed based on the `meats` list and the conditions specified, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
