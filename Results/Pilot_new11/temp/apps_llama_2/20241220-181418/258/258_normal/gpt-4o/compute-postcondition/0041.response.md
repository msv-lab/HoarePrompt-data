Since the code is a `continue` statement, it doesn't change any variable values but rather skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is less than `K`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2` and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
