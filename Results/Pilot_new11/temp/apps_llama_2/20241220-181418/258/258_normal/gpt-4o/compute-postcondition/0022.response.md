The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 8, so the new value of `index` is 11. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 2, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[9])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[10])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 11, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 2, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[9])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[10])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 11, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))**
