Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, if `d * d2 > d2`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution of the if-else block ends without any further modifications.**
