Postcondition: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `d > 1`, if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns Boolean value True, otherwise, no explicit return value is specified.**
