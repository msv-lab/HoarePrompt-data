To calculate the output state, let's first understand what the given code does. The code is extracting the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` from the `meats` list at index `i`. Given that `i` is 1, we are essentially doing `x1, y1, c1 = meats[1]`.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `meats` is a list of triples, with `meats[0]` potentially modified.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is a positive integer and is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- The values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`.
- The values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on calculations performed based on the `meats` list and specified conditions.

However, the given code snippet only updates `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` based on the values in `meats` at index `i` (which is 1). It does not directly modify any other variables.

Given this information, and since we do not have the explicit values of `meats[1]`, we can conclude that:
- `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values of the second triple in the `meats` list (`meats[1]`).
- Other variables (`K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`) retain their previous values or states as they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[1]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, and the values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on the calculations performed based on the `meats` list and the conditions specified**.
