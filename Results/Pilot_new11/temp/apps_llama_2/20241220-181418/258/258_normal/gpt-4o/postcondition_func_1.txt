The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N` (an integer representing the number of pieces of meat), `K` (an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat required to be ready), and `meats` (a list of lists where each sublist contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat). It then performs a binary search to converge on a value `high` within a precision of `1e-07` or less, utilizing a helper function `func_1` to determine the convergence criteria based on `meats`, `K`, and the current mid-value. The final state of the program after execution is the return of `high`, which represents the converged value. The function does not modify the input parameters `N`, `K`, or `meats`. The purpose of the function appears to be finding a threshold value related to the readiness of the pieces of meat, as determined by `func_1`, with the given constraints. The function handles potential edge cases by ensuring convergence within a specified precision, but the logic of `func_1` and its impact on the convergence is not detailed in the provided annotations.
