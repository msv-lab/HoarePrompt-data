The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will have no effect on the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
