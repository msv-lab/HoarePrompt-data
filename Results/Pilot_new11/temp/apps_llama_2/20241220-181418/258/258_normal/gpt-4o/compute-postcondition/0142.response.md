To determine the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and how the provided Python code snippet affects it.

Given Initial State:
- `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is a positive integer at least 4.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is to be set to `i + 1` = 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
```
Given that `j` is set to `i + 1` and `i` is 2, `j` equals 3. This means the code is accessing the triple at `meats[3]` (since indexing starts at 0).

Output State:
The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are set to the values of the triple at `meats[3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]`.**
