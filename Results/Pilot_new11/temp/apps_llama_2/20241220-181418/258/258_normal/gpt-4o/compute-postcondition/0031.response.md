Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d^2 > 1`, and `count` is less than `K` and might have changed. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the first and third triples in `meats` are swapped, meaning `x1` becomes the first element of the third triple, `y1` becomes the second element of the third triple, `c1` becomes the third element of the third triple, `x2` becomes the first element of the first triple, `y2` becomes the second element of the first triple, and `c2` becomes the third element of the first triple. Otherwise, the state of `meats`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remains unchanged, `d` might have changed, `cx` might have changed, `cy` might have changed, `dx` might have changed, `dy` might have changed, `d2` might have changed, `mx` might have changed, `my` might have changed.**
