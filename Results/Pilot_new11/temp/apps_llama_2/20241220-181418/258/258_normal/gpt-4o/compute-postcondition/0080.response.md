Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are calculated based on the last iteration, `count` is either the final sum or the value leading to early return if `count >= K`, and if `d` (which is `c1 * T - c2 * T`) is less than 0, then the second and third triples in `meats` are swapped, regardless of the value of `d`, the program proceeds to the next iteration or termination based on the conditions of the loop or the value of `count`.**
