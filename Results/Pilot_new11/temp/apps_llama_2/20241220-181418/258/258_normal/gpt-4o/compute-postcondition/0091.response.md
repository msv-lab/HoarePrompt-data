To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is a positive integer and at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)`
- `d` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is used in the calculation of `mx` and `my`. For the sake of calculation, let's assume `d` is defined and is a positive real number, as it affects the calculation of `mx` and `my`.

The given code snippet:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program state:
- The value of `my` is assigned based on the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.
- The calculation involves `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`, but since `d` is not defined in the initial state, we must recognize its role in the calculation as a separate entity.
- The states of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state, considering the given code snippet and the initial state, is:
- `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is a positive integer and at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)`
- `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
