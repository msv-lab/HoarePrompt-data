Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged. `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, where `c1` and `c2` are values from the potentially swapped triples at `meats[2]` and `meats[5]`. If `d` is less than 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
