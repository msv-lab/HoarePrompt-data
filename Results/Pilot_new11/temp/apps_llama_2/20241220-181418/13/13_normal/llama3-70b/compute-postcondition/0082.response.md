The code snippet provided is a `break` statement. This statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside of. 

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, all the variables retain their current values. The loop or conditional statement that this `break` statement is a part of will be exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
