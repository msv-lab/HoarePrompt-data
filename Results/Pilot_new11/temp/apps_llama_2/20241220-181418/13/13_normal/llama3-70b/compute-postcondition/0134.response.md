The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Initially, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1. After the increment, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` becomes 3, otherwise, `beauty` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 3, otherwise, `beauty` is 2**
