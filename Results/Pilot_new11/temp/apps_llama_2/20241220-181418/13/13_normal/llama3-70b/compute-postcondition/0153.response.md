The value of `beauty` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `beauty` is unknown, so we update the value of `beauty` as `beauty + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 4`, and `beauty` is `beauty + 1`.
