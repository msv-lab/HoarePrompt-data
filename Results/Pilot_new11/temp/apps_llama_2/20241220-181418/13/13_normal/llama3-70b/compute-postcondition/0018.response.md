To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, we'll analyze the loop and the output states provided after each iteration.

The loop is designed to increment `left` as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at index `left` in string `s` is not 'G'. This indicates that the loop will continue until it finds a 'G' character in the string `s` starting from the leftmost position and moving towards the right, or until `left` meets or exceeds `right`.

Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop:

- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, but its value does not change within the loop provided.
- `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are initialized to 0, but their values do not change within this loop.
- `left` is initially 0, and `right` is initially greater than 0 with the character at index `right` in string `s` being 'S'.

The loop increments `left` until it either finds a 'G' (at which point the loop condition fails because `s[left]` equals 'G', thus `left` will be the index of the first 'G' from the left) or until `left` is no longer less than `right`, whichever comes first.

The output state after the loop executes can be summarized based on these observations:

- `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` maintain their initial values since the loop does not modify these variables.
- `right` maintains its initial value since it is not modified within the loop.
- `left` will either be the index of the first 'G' encountered from the left in string `s`, or it will be equal to `right` if no 'G' is found before `left` meets or exceeds `right`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right` retain their initial values, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` from the left or equals `right`, depending on whether a 'G' was found before `left` met or exceeded `right`.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right` retain their initial values, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equals `right`.**
