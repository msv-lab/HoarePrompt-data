The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 1. Therefore, the new value of `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is still the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is still 0, `i` is still greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is still 'G', `j` is still `i + 2`, and the current value of `s` at index `j` is still 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S`, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 2, `j` is `i + 2`, and the current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G'**
