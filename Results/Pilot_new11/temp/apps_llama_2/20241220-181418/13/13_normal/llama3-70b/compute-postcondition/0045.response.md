The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was less than `right` and not in `golden` unless its increment makes it equal to a value in `golden`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
 Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `left` is its initial value plus 2 and is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is incremented by 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0.
