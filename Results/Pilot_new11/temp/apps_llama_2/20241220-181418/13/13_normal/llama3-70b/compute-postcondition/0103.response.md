According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by 1, so `j` is `i - 3`. Also, since `j` is `i - 3`, `i` must be at least 3 for `j` to be greater than -1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 3`**
