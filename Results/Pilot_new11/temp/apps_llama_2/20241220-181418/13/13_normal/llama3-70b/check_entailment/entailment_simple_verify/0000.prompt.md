You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks for the maximum beauty after a single swap. The current implementation only checks for swaps where a golden trophy is immediately followed by a silver trophy, and it only checks for this pattern in the order from left to right. 

However, the problem statement does not impose these constraints. A single swap can be performed between any two trophies, regardless of their positions or the characters that follow them. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible swaps between golden and silver trophies, not just the ones where a golden trophy is immediately followed by a silver trophy.

For example, consider the input "SGGS". The current program will not be able to find the optimal solution, which is to swap the first and third trophies, resulting in "GGSS". 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to check all possible swaps between golden and silver trophies, and then calculate the maximum beauty achievable after each swap. 

Here is a simplified example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    max_beauty = 0

    # Function to calculate the maximum beauty of the arrangement
    def calculate_beauty(arr):
        max_beauty = 0
        curr_beauty = 0
        for char in arr:
            if char == 'G':
                curr_beauty += 1
                max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            else:
                curr_beauty = 0
        return max_beauty

    # Calculate the maximum beauty without any swaps
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, calculate_beauty(s))

    # Check all possible swaps
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if s[i]!= s[j]:
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                max_beauty = max(max_beauty, calculate_beauty(s))
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]

    print(max_beauty)

func()
```
In this corrected code, we first calculate the maximum beauty without any swaps. Then, we check all possible swaps between different characters and calculate the maximum beauty after each swap. The maximum beauty achievable after any swap is then compared to the maximum beauty without any swaps, and the larger value is printed as the result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
