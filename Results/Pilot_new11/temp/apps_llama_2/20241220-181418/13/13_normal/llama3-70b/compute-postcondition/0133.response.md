According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range of the loop. The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `-1` (exclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i - 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is greater than or equal to `2`. 

Since `j` is `i - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be decremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i - 2`. Since `j` is the index of the string `s` and `n` is the length of `s`, `j` will be valid as long as it is greater than or equal to `0`. 

For `j` to be valid, `i - 2` should be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `i` should be greater than or equal to `2`. 

However, we also need to consider the condition where the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'S'. If this condition is met, we break out of the loop. 

So, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be `i - 2`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` should not be 'S', or if it is 'S', we are now in the next iteration, so `beauty` should be 1 (as it is when the character at index `j` is 'S').

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1**
