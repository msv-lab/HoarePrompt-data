According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `left` must be less than `right`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `right`, and since the loop body is omitted, we can't assume `s[left]` is 'G' or not. For the loop to execute again, `left` must be less than `right` (so it needs to be adjusted to `left` is less than `right`), and `s[left]` must not be 'G'. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is less than `right` and `s[left]` is not 'G'**
