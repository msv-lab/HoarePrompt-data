The code sets `curr_beauty` to 0. The initial state had `n` as an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` as a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, and `right` as incremented by 1, `max_beauty` as the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`. 

With `curr_beauty` now being 0, `max_beauty` will be the maximum of its previous value and 0, which means `max_beauty` will either remain the same if its previous value was greater than 0, or it will become 0 if its previous value was less than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0**
