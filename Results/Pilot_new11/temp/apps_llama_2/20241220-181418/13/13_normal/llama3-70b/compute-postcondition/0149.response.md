The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
