The `break` statement terminates the loop that it is currently inside. Since we are directly inside a loop when this statement is encountered, we break out of this loop. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop is exited. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop.
