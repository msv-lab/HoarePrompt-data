According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already given as an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), it is ensured that the loop will execute. The loop variable `right` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, the state of `right` should be adjusted to 0, as it will be initialized to 0 in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
