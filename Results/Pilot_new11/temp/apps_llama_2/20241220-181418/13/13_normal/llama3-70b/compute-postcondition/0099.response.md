To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `i` is at least 2.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `j` is `i - 1`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `j` starts at `i - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must decrease by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be `i - 2`.

Since `j` is now `i - 2`, and we know that `i` is at least 2 and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, the condition for `n` being greater than `i + 1` remains valid because decreasing `i` by 1 (to consider the next iteration's `j` value) still keeps `n` greater than the new `i` value plus 1, given the original constraints.

However, the critical aspect to consider is the value of `beauty` and its dependence on the character at index `j` in `s`. If the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2. If the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', then `beauty` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this, for the loop to execute one more time without breaking due to the character being 'S', we must consider that the loop continues as long as `j` is within the bounds of the string `s` and has not encountered a condition that would break it. Thus, `j` should be at least 0 to be within the bounds, but since we're decreasing `j` from `i - 1`, the loop's continuation depends solely on `j` not being less than 0 and the loop's body not forcing an exit.

Considering all these points, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `n` remains between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `i` remains at least 2, but since we are considering the next iteration based on `j`, the focus is on `j`'s new value.
- `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, as the loop's conditions and bounds are dependent on `j` and its relation to `s`, not directly on `i`'s value in this context.
- `j` is now `i - 2`, reflecting the decrease by 1 in the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`**
