Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 1. Otherwise, `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `max_beauty` retain their initial values, `right` retains its value, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equals `right`. If `left` is less than `right`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, otherwise `curr_beauty` retains its initial value of 0.***
