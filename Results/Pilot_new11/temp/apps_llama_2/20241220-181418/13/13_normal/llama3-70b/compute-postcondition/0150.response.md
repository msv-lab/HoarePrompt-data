The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Since there are no variables being updated or modified in the given code snippet, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement simply exits the innermost loop or conditional statement it is directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
