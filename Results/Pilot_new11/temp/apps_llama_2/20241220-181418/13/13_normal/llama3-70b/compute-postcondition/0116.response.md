The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
