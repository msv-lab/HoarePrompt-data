To execute the loop one more time, two conditions must be met: `left` must be less than `right`, and `s[left]` must not be equal to 'G'. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is its initial value plus 2, and `right` is incremented by 1. For `left` to be less than `right`, `right` must be greater than its initial value plus 2, since `left` is its initial value plus 2. This condition is already met because `right` is incremented by 1, which implies `right` is now greater than its initial value, and since `left` is its initial value plus 2, `right` must be at least its initial value plus 3 to satisfy the condition `left < right`. 

However, the condition `s[left]!= 'G'` must also be met. For this to be true, `left` must not point to an index in the `golden` list, because that list contains the indices of 'G' characters in `s`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s` and `left` is not in `golden`, `left` is its initial value plus 2, `right` is incremented by 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0**
