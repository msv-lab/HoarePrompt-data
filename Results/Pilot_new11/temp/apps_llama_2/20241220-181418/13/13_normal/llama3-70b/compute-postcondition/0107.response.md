To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
This loop starts from the index `i - 1` and moves backwards to index `0`. It checks each character in the string `s` at the current index `j`. If the character is 'G', it increments the `beauty` variable by 1. If the character is 'S', it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can see that:

* The loop will execute at least once if `i` is at least 2.
* The loop will execute at least 2 times if `i` is at least 3.
* The loop will execute at least 3 times if `i` is at least 4.
* The value of `beauty` increases by 1 for each 'G' character encountered in the string `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the loop reaches the beginning of the string.

Considering the initial state and the loop code, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

* `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
* `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
* `i` is greater than or equal to 1, but since the loop requires `i` to be at least 2 to execute, the original value of `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed.
* `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
* `j` will be the index where the loop broke, either because an 'S' character was encountered or because the loop reached the beginning of the string (`j` will be `-1` if the loop completed without breaking).
* `beauty` will be incremented by 1 for each 'G' character in the string `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the loop reaches the beginning of the string. If no 'G' characters are encountered (i.e., the loop breaks immediately because the character at index `i - 1` is 'S' or because `i` is 1 and the loop does not execute), `beauty` will remain 1.

Given the relationship of `beauty` with the string `s` and the index `i`, the final value of `beauty` can be described as being equal to 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.**
