The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached. 

So, the new value of `beauty` is the old value of `beauty` plus 1, which is 2 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', 
`golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, 
`i` is greater than or equal to 1, 
`n` is greater than `i + 1`, 
`j` is `i + 2`, 
`s` at index `j` is 'G', 
`beauty` is 2 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `s` at index `j` is 'G', `beauty` is 2 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached**
