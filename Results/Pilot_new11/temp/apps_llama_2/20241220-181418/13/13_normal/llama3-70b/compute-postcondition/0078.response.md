The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate, but it does not modify any variables. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', 
`golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, 
`max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, 
`max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, 
`i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, 
the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', 
`beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 1, 
`j` is `i + 2`, 
`s[j]` is 'S', 
and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
