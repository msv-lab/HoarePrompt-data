The code snippet `break` indicates the termination of the innermost loop or control structure. Given the initial conditions, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, and `j` do not change, but we exit the closest loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
