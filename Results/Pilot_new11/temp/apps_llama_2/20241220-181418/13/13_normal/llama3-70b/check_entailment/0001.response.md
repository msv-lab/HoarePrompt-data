Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for swaps between adjacent elements, and does not consider the case where the two elements to be swapped are not adjacent. 

For example, if the input is "GSGGGGSG", the program should output 6, because we can swap the first 'S' with the last 'S' to get "GGGGGGS". However, the program only checks for adjacent swaps and will not find this solution.

The correct solution should check all possible swaps of two elements and calculate the maximum length of consecutive 'G's after each swap.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
8
GSGGGGSG

Expected output:
6

Actual output:
5

The program does not consider all possible swaps and therefore does not find the optimal solution.
