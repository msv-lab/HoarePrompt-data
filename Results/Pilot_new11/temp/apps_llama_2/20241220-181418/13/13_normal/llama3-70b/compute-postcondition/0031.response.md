To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **`left < right`**: For this condition to be true, since `left` is being incremented (`left` is `left + 1`), `right` must be greater than the new value of `left`. Since we don't know the exact values of `left` and `right` but know `right` is initially greater than or equal to `left`, after incrementing `left`, `right` must be greater than the new `left` for the loop to potentially execute again.

2. **`s[left]!= 'G'`**: For this condition to be true, the character at the new `left` index in string `s` must not be 'G'. This implies that the next character (after the current `left` index) in the string `s` should not be 'G' if we want the loop to execute again.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `right` is greater than or equal to `left`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `left` is `left + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure:
- `right` must be greater than the new value of `left` (after `left` has been incremented).
- The next character in `s` (at the new `left` index) must not be 'G', meaning the new `left` index should not be in the list `golden` if we are to guarantee the loop can execute again based on the string condition alone.

However, since `left` has just been incremented and we are considering the conditions under which the loop could execute again, we simply need to ensure that the conditions hold true without explicitly adjusting `s` or `golden` since those are given conditions of the problem, not variables we adjust for loop continuation. The crucial adjustment is conceptual, understanding that for the loop to continue, `right` must remain greater than `left` after its increment, and the character at the new `left` index in `s` must not be 'G'.

Thus, the primary adjustment conceptually is that `right` needs to be greater than the new value of `left`, and we are looking at a scenario where `s[left]` (after incrementing `left`) is not 'G' for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` must be greater than the new `left`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and the character at the new `left` index in `s` must not be 'G'**
