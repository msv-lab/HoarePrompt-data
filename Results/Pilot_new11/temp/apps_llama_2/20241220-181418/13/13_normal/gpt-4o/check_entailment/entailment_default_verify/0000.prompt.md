You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For instance, consider the case when the input is "SGGGGSG", the program should return 5 (swapping the first 'S' with the last 'S'), but the current program returns 4.

The problem with the current program is that it doesn't consider all potential swaps of two trophies to maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. The current program only checks if the two segments of golden trophies can be merged by removing a single silver trophy between them, but it doesn't consider the case when a silver trophy is at the end or the beginning of the sequence and can be swapped with another silver trophy in the middle to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies.

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all potential swaps of two trophies and calculate the maximum length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies after the swap. 

Additionally, the last line of the function `func_1(n, trophies)` is also incorrect, as it may return `max_length + 1` even if the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies is actually less than or equal to `max_length`. This could happen when there are no silver trophies that can be swapped to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            temp_trophies = list(trophies)
            temp_trophies[i], temp_trophies[j] = temp_trophies[j], temp_trophies[i]
            current_length = 0
            max_current_length = 0
            for k in range(n):
                if temp_trophies[k] == 'G':
                    current_length += 1
                    max_current_length = max(max_current_length, current_length)
                else:
                    current_length = 0
            max_length = max(max_length, max_current_length)
    return max_length
```
This function checks all possible swaps of two trophies, calculates the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies after the swap, and returns the maximum length found.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `trophies`, where `n` is the length of the `trophies` string, and returns an integer value based on the sequences of 'G' in the `trophies` string and the value of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
