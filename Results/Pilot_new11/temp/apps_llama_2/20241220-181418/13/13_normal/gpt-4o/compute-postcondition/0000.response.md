The code `segments = []` is executed. This creates a new empty list called `segments`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and `trophies` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is an empty list**
