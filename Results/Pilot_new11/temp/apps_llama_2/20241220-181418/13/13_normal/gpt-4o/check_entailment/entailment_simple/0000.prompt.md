You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, and `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, and `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, and `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the length of the only sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string, which is max_length = end - start + 1, where start and end are the start and end indices of the sequence in the unchanged `trophies` string
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, and the number of segments is more than 1
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` equals its original value.
    #   - `trophies` remains unchanged.
    #   - `i` equals `n`.
    #   - `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string.
    #   - `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, which is the maximum length of a sequence of 'G' in `trophies`.
    #   - The number of segments is more than 1.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```python
    #   for i in range(1, len(segments)):
    #       prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
    #       curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
    #       if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
    #           max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    #   ```
    #   This loop compares each pair of consecutive segments of 'G' in `trophies`. If the start of the current segment is exactly 2 positions after the end of the previous segment, it calculates the combined length of these two segments plus 1 (for the single character in between) and updates `max_length` if this combined length is greater than the current `max_length`.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Loop Executes**:
    #   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `trophies` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `i` will be equal to the length of `segments` after the loop finishes, since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(segments)`.
    #   - `segments` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop; it still contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in `trophies`.
    #   - `max_length` will be the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' in `trophies`, considering both individual segments and combinations of segments that are separated by a single character. This is because the loop checks for segments that are close enough to potentially form a longer sequence when combined with the single character in between.
    #
    #4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
    #   - If `segments` has 1 or fewer elements, the loop will not execute because `range(1, len(segments))` will be empty. In this case, `max_length` remains as initially calculated (the maximum length of a segment of 'G'), and other variables (`n`, `trophies`, `i`) retain their original values.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals the number of segments, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in `trophies`, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' considering both individual and combinable segments.**
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' in `trophies` (considering individual and combinable segments) plus one, and the original value of `n`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
