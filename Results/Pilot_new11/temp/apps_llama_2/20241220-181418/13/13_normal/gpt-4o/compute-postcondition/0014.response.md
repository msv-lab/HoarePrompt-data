The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The character at index `i` in `trophies` was 'S' when `i` was 0, but now `i` is 1, so the character at index `i` in `trophies` can be either 'G' or 'S'. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
