The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was such that if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, and if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is either 1 or 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. Also, `i` was 1 more than its previous value when `trophies[i]` is 'S', and `trophies` previously had 'S' at its `i-1` index, and `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented, the new value of `i` is greater than its previous value by 1, but still `i` must be less than or equal to `n` if `trophies[0]` is 'G', or `i` is either 2 or 3 if `trophies[0]` is 'S'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, and if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is either 2 or 3 and `n` must be greater than 1. If `trophies[i-1]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 more than its previous value, and `trophies` previously had 'S' at its `i-2` index, and `i` must be less than `n`. Additionally, the character at index `i-1` in `trophies` is 'S'**
