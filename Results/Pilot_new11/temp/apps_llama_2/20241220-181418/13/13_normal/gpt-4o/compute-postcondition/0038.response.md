To calculate the result, we need to understand that `segments` is a list that stores tuples representing segments. The given code appends a tuple to the `segments` list. This tuple contains two values: `start` and `i - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` equals the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or equals `n` if all characters are 'G'.
- `start` equals `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the length of the `trophies` string.

The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` will append a tuple to the `segments` list where the first element of the tuple is `start` (which is `i + 1`) and the second element is `i - 1`.

So, the tuple appended to `segments` is `(i + 1, i - 1)`. 

However, given that `start` equals `i + 1`, the tuple can also be expressed as `(start, i - 1)`.

After appending this tuple to `segments`, the state of the variables `i`, `start`, and `n` does not change, but `segments` now contains an additional tuple.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` equals the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or equals `n` if all characters are 'G', `start` equals `i + 1`, `n` remains the length of the `trophies` string, and `segments` contains the tuple `(i + 1, i - 1)` or equivalently `(start, i - 1)`.

Output State: **`i` equals the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or equals `n` if all characters are 'G', `start` equals `i + 1`, `n` remains the length of the `trophies` string, and `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`**
