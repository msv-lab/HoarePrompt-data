Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, and if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is either 1 or 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' encountered in `trophies` starting from the initial value of `i`, or `n` if all characters are 'G', and `segments` includes a new tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 more than its previous value, and `trophies` previously had 'S' at its `i-1` index. `trophies` remains unchanged.***
