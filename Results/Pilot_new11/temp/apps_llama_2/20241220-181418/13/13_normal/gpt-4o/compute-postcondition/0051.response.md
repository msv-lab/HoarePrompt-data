The code assigns the start and end indices of the previous sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string to the variables `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` equals 0, which corresponds to the first sequence of 'G' in the `segments` list.

Therefore, the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the start and end indices of the first sequence of 'G' in the `segments` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is still 1, `segments` still contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, and `max_length` is still equal to `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`.

Output State: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, `prev_start` equals `segments[0][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[0][1]`**
