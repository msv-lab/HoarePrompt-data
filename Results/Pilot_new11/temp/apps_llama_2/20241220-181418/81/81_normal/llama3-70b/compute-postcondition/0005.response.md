To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code step by step.

 Initially, `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is `a % b` (the old `a` modulo the old `b`), with `b` being non-zero. 

Given the line of code:
```python
a, b = b, a % b
```
This line simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. 

- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is `a % b` (from the initial state).
- The new value of `b` becomes `a % b`, where `a` is the old value of `b` (because the old `a` is now `b` after the first part of the assignment) and `b` is the old `a`.

However, in the context of the given initial state, `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is the result of the old `a` modulo the old `b`. So, when we update `a` and `b` according to the given line of code:

- The new `a` is the old `b`, which is `a % b` (old `a` modulo old `b`).
- The new `b` is the result of the new `a` (which is the old `b`) modulo the old `a` (which is now `b` after the assignment).

Since `a` is initially the old value of `b`, and `b` is `a % b` (old `a` modulo old `b`), after the assignment:
- `a` becomes `b`, which initially is `a % b`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`, but here `a` is the new `a` which is the old `b`, and `b` is the old `a`.

So, the new `b` is actually the old `b` modulo the old `a`.

But, considering the initial state's descriptions and applying them directly to the code's effect:
- `a` is now the old `b`.
- `b` is now the result of the operation involving the old values, but since `a` and `b` swap their roles in the operation, we consider the operation as it applies to their new roles.

The new `b` is essentially the result of the operation that would have been the next step in a series of operations where `a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values, but since we are not given specific values for `a` and `b` initially, we describe their update in terms of their initial relationship.

Therefore, considering the assignment and the initial conditions, `a` takes the value that `b` had, which was the result of the modulo operation, and `b` takes a new value based on the operation that involves `a` (now holding the old value of `b`) and the original `a` (now `b`).

However, since we know `b` is non-zero and is the result of `a % b`, after the swap:
- `a` is `b`, which means it's the result of the old `a` modulo the old `b`.
- `b` becomes the result of the new `a` (which is the old `b`) modulo the new `b` (which is the old `a`), implying a continuation of the modulo operation sequence but with swapped operands.

Given the nature of the problem, the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, but their relationship and the effect of the operation on them can be described. The confusion in the explanation arises from attempting to apply the initial conditions directly to the outcome of the operation without specific values for `a` and `b`.

The output state, focusing on the direct outcome of the operation given, should reflect the new values of `a` and `b` post-operation, considering `b` is non-zero and acknowledging the swap and modulo operation's effect:

Output State: **`a` is the old `b` which is `a % b` (old `a` modulo old `b`), and `b` is the result of the new `a` (old `b`) modulo the old `a` (now `b`), with `b` being non-zero.**
