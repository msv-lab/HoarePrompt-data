The given code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b` to `b` and `a % b`, respectively. 

Given that `a` is a non-zero integer and `b` must be non-zero, after the execution of the code, `a` becomes the old value of `b` (which is non-zero), and `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`. 

This operation is essentially a step in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The new `b` (which is `a % b`) will be less than the old `b` (since `a` and `b` are non-zero), but it does not directly give us a specific value for `a` or `b` without knowing their initial values. However, we can infer that `a` is now the old value of `b` (a non-zero integer), and `b` is the remainder of the old division of `a` by `b`, which means `b` is also an integer and, given the properties of the remainder operation, will be less than the absolute value of the old `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the old value of `b` (a non-zero integer), `b` is the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b` (an integer less than the absolute value of the old `b`).

Output State: **`a` is the old value of `b` (a non-zero integer), `b` is `a % b` (the old `a` modulo the old `b`), both `a` and `b` are non-zero integers**
