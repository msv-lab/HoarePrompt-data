You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

After analyzing the provided program, I believe it correctly implements the solution to the problem. The code checks all possible pairs of integers (a, b) within the given range [l, r] that satisfy the conditions GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1.  The program first checks if y is divisible by x, which is a necessary condition for the existence of good pairs (a, b).
2.  It then calculates z = y // x and iterates over all factors of z to find potential values for a and b.
3.  For each factor i of z, it calculates a = i \* x and b = z // i \* x, ensuring that a and b are within the range [l, r] and that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.
4.  The code correctly handles cases where a = b (only counting them once) and cases where a ≠ b (counting them twice, since (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different pairs).

The provided examples also validate the correctness of the program. After reviewing the code and testing it with various inputs, I couldn't find any cases where the program fails to work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and returns either `0` or the total count of distinct pairs of numbers `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions: (1) both `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, (2) the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and (3) the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD equals `y`. This count includes pairs where `a` equals `b` (counted once) and pairs where `a` is not equal to `b` (counted twice). If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function immediately returns `0`. Upon completing its execution, the function returns the calculated count, which reflects the total number of distinct pairs satisfying these conditions within the given range and mathematical constraints. The input parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values throughout the function's execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
