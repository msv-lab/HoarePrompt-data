According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `z`. If `i` is less than the square root of `z`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `z` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `z` must be at least 9 to ensure that the square root of `z` is at least 3. 

State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3**
