Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3. If `z` is divisible by `i`, then `a` is `3 * x`, `b` equals `(y // (3 * x)) * x`. If `l` <= `a` <= `r` and `l` <= `b` <= `r` and `math.gcd(a, b)` equals `x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b)` equals `y`, then if `a` equals `b`, `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` is increased by 2. If `z` is not divisible by `i`, then the state remains unchanged.***
