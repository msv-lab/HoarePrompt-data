Functionality: **The function determines and adds all possible missing marks to a given set of marks, such that the difference between any two marks in the resulting set includes the specified values x and y, without exceeding the given limit l. It does this by first checking for the existence of pairs of marks with differences of x and y, and then appending the missing differences to the list if they are not found. The function then generates additional missing marks by summing the existing marks with the initial missing differences, as long as the sums do not exceed the limit l and are not already in the set of marks. The function prints the number of additional marks and the additional marks themselves. It implicitly accepts parameters n, l, x, y, and a sequence of marks, and returns the number and values of additional marks needed to satisfy the conditions. The function handles edge cases where n is 0, or where x or y are already present in the set of marks, and does not append duplicate values to the list of additional marks.**
