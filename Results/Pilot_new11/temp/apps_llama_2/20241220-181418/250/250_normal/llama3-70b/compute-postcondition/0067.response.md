Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `need_x` is False. If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`. If `need_y` is True, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x` if `need_x` is False, otherwise `additional_marks` remains an empty list.**
