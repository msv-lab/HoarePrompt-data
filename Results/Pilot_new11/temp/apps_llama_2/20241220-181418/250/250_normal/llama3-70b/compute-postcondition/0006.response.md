The code sets `need_x` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is still an input integer, `x` is still an input integer, `y` is still an input integer, `marks` is still a set of input integers, `need_y` is still `False`, `i` is still 0, `j` is still 0, and the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is still equal to `x`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`**
