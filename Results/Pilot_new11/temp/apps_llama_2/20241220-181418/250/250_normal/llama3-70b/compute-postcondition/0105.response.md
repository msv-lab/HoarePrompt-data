The code prints the length of `additional_marks`. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does return the length of `additional_marks`. The length of `additional_marks` is the number of all possible sums of elements from `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` has iterated over all elements in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, and the length of `additional_marks` has been returned.**
