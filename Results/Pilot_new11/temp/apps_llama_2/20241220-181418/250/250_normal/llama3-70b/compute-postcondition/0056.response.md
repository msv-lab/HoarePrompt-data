Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True. Otherwise, there are no additional changes to the variables.***
