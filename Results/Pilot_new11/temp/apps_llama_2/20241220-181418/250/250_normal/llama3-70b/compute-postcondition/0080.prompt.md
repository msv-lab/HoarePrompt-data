You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers.
   - `i` is an element in `marks`.
   - `need_x` is False.
   - If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`.
   - If `need_y` is True, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x` if `need_x` is False; otherwise, `additional_marks` remains an empty list.

2. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and if `i + j` is not in `marks`.
   - If both conditions are met, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

3. **Output State After Loop Executions**:
   - After 1 iteration, if there exists a `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is within the limit `l` and not in `marks`, `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The state of other variables remains unchanged unless directly affected by the loop (e.g., `marks` could be conceptually updated with new elements, but its original state is preserved in the problem context).
   - After 2 iterations, the process repeats, potentially adding more elements to `additional_marks` if the conditions are met.
   - After 3 iterations, the same logic applies, with `additional_marks` potentially growing further if new sums (`i + j`) meet the conditions.

Given this pattern, the loop continues until no more elements can be added to `additional_marks` because either the sum `i + j` exceeds `l` or `i + j` is already in `marks` for all remaining elements in `additional_marks`.

**Key Observations**:
- The loop modifies `additional_marks` by adding new elements that are sums of existing elements in `marks` and elements in `additional_marks`, under certain conditions.
- The original values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the initial `marks` are input parameters and do not change due to the loop's execution.
- `need_x` remains False.
- `need_y`'s value (True or False) influences the initial state of `additional_marks` but does not change during the loop's execution.

**Output State Calculation**:
Considering the loop's behavior and the conditions under which elements are added to `additional_marks`, we can infer the following about the output state:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` retain their original input values.
- `marks` originally is a non-empty set of integers and may conceptually include new elements generated during the loop, though its original definition doesn't change.
- `i` refers to an element in `marks`, which could be any element depending on the loop's progression.
- `need_x` is False.
- `need_y` could be either True or False but remains constant.
- `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from `marks` and initial elements in `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not already in `marks`. Its final state depends on the initial values of `x`, `y`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the elements in `marks`.

**Output State**:
**`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that may have been conceptually updated, `i` refers to an element in the updated conceptual `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.**
```
for i in marks:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
