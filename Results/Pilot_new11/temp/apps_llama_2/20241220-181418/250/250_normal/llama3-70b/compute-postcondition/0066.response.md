The code `additional_marks.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the end of the list `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `need_x` is False, `additional_marks` initially contains the value of `x`. After appending `y`, `additional_marks` will contain the values of `x` and `y`. 

If `n` is 0, then both `need_x` and `need_y` are False. If `n` is greater than 0, then `need_x` is False and `i` is `n-1`. The value of `need_y` is False. The set `marks` still contains the same input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, and `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`.**
