The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the set `additional_marks`. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` is a set of integers that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not an element in the set `marks`. 

The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `j` are not affected. The value of `additional_marks` changes by having `i + j` added to it. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` is a set of integers that includes its original elements and `i + j`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.**
