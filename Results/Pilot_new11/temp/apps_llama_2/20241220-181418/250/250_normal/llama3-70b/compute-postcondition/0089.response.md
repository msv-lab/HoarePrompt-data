To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code provided is:
```python
additional_marks.append(i + j)
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process
- `i` is the next element in `marks`
- `need_x` is False
- `need_y` is either True or False
- `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process
- `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`

The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`. 

- The value of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remains unchanged.
- `i` is still the next element in `marks`, implying that `marks` has not been modified by this operation.
- `additional_marks` now includes an additional element which is the sum of `i` and `j`.
- The status of `j` being the next element in the updated `additional_marks` changes because `j` has been used to update `additional_marks`, so the next element in `additional_marks` would be different after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process
- `i` is the next element in `marks`
- `need_x` is False
- `need_y` is either True or False
- `additional_marks` has been updated with a new element `i + j` and has at least one more element to process
- The next element in the updated `additional_marks` is different from `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` includes `i + j` and has at least one more element to process, the next element in `additional_marks` is different from `j`.**
