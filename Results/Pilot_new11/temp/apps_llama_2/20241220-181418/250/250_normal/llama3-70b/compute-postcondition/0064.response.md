Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `need_x` is False, if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` with a difference of `y`, then `need_y` is True, otherwise `need_y` is False, if `n` is 0, then both `need_x` and `need_y` are False, `additional_marks` is a list, if `need_x` is False, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x`, otherwise `additional_marks` remains an empty list.**
