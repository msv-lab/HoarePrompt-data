Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2. If there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `need_y` is `True`. If there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then the conditions for `need_x` are met. Otherwise, `need_x` remains unchanged. The conditions for `need_y` being `True` also include the case where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`.**
