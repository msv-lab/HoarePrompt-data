To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers.
   - `i` is an element in `marks`.
   - `need_x` is False.
   - If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`.
   - If `need_y` is True, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x` if `need_x` is False; otherwise, `additional_marks` remains an empty list.

2. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and if `i + j` is not in `marks`.
   - If both conditions are met, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

3. **Output State After Loop Executions**:
   - After 1 iteration, if there exists a `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is within the limit `l` and not in `marks`, `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The state of other variables remains unchanged unless directly affected by the loop (e.g., `marks` could be conceptually updated with new elements, but its original state is preserved in the problem context).
   - After 2 iterations, the process repeats, potentially adding more elements to `additional_marks` if the conditions are met.
   - After 3 iterations, the same logic applies, with `additional_marks` potentially growing further if new sums (`i + j`) meet the conditions.

Given this pattern, the loop continues until no more elements can be added to `additional_marks` because either the sum `i + j` exceeds `l` or `i + j` is already in `marks` for all remaining elements in `additional_marks`.

**Key Observations**:
- The loop modifies `additional_marks` by adding new elements that are sums of existing elements in `marks` and elements in `additional_marks`, under certain conditions.
- The original values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the initial `marks` are input parameters and do not change due to the loop's execution.
- `need_x` remains False.
- `need_y`'s value (True or False) influences the initial state of `additional_marks` but does not change during the loop's execution.

**Output State Calculation**:
Considering the loop's behavior and the conditions under which elements are added to `additional_marks`, we can infer the following about the output state:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` retain their original input values.
- `marks` originally is a non-empty set of integers and may conceptually include new elements generated during the loop, though its original definition doesn't change.
- `i` refers to an element in `marks`, which could be any element depending on the loop's progression.
- `need_x` is False.
- `need_y` could be either True or False but remains constant.
- `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from `marks` and initial elements in `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not already in `marks`. Its final state depends on the initial values of `x`, `y`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the elements in `marks`.

**Output State**:
**`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that may have been conceptually updated, `i` refers to an element in the updated conceptual `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.**
