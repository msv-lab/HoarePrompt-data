According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the given states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0 (since the range function in Python starts from 0 by default).

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0**
