Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`. The current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`**
