Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, if `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`, then `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, including the newly added `i + j`, and `j` is the first element in the updated `additional_marks`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, with `additional_marks` not empty and containing all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.***
