The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. Since `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element in `marks`, this operation is valid and updates the `additional_marks` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, including the newly added `i + j`, and `j` is the first element in the updated `additional_marks`.**
