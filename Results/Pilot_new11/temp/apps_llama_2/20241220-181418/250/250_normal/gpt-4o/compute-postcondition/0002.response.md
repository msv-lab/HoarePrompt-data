To determine the output state, we first look at the given code and initial state. The initial state provides values or constraints for variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks`. The code then converts the list `marks` into a set, `marks_set`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l)

The code:
```python
marks_set = set(marks)
```

Impact of the code:
- The list `marks` is converted into a set `marks_set`. This means that any duplicate values in `marks` are removed in `marks_set`, and the order of elements is not preserved.

Output State:
- `n` remains an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` remains an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` remains an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` remains an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` remains a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l)
- `marks_set` is a set created from `marks`, containing unique values from `marks` without any particular order.

Since sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values, if `marks` had any duplicate marks, they would be removed in `marks_set`. However, given that `marks` represents a sequence on a ruler where each mark is distinct (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), it's implied that `marks` does not contain duplicates, making `marks_set` a set representation of the same unique values as `marks`, just without the order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.**
