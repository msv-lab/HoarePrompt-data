Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] - y`. Otherwise, the state of `new_marks` depends on the conditions `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, `mark - x - y` being in `marks_set`, which may lead to `new_marks` containing `marks[1] + x` or at least `marks[1] - x` if none of the initial conditions are met and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.**
