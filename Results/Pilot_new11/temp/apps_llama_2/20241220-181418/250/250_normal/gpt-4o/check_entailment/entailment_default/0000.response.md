Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of additional marks needed on the ruler to measure distances x and y. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The code first checks if there are any existing marks that are x or y units away from each other. If such marks exist for both x and y, it prints 0, indicating that no additional marks are needed.

2. If not, it then checks if adding a single mark (either x or y units away from an existing mark) can cover both distances. If such a mark exists, it prints 1 and the value of the mark.

3. If not, it then checks if adding both x and y marks is necessary. If so, it prints 2 and the values of x and y.

The code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when the ruler already has marks that can measure x and y, when a single additional mark can cover both distances, and when both x and y marks need to be added.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, it appears that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, assuming valid input.
