The given code introduces a new variable `x_found` and assigns it the value `False`. The initial state variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, and `x_found` is False**
