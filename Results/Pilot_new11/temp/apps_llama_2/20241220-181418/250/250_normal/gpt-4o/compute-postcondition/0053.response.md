According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 2 marks, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 1 mark. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `marks` must have at least 2 marks. Since `mark` is an element of `marks`, for the loop to execute again, `mark` will be the next element in the list. The index of `mark` in `marks` will increase by 1. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`) retain their properties. 
State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`**
