To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`
- The current value of `y_found` is False
- The state of `x_found` is unchanged
- For all marks in `marks`, the following conditions are still not met: `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`. However, for at least one mark in `marks`, either `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`

Given the code snippet:
```python
new_marks.add(mark - y)
```

This line of code adds a new mark to the `new_marks` set, which is calculated by subtracting `y` from each mark in `marks`. The `new_marks` set is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it's created with this operation, initially empty.

After executing this code:
- `n` remains unchanged
- `l` remains unchanged
- `x` remains unchanged
- `y` remains unchanged
- `marks` remains unchanged
- `marks_set` remains unchanged
- `y_found` remains False
- The state of `x_found` remains unchanged
- The conditions regarding `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, and `mark - y - x` being in `marks_set` are still as initially stated
- A new set, `new_marks`, is introduced, containing the results of `mark - y` for each mark in `marks`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is False, the state of `x_found` is unchanged, for all marks in `marks`, the conditions regarding `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, and `mark - y - x` being in `marks_set` are as initially stated, and `new_marks` is a set containing the results of `mark - y` for each mark in `marks`**
