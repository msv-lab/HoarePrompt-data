Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. It first checks if there are any markings that are `x` or `y` units away from each other. If such markings exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it then calculates and prints either a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking, or a list of `x` and `y` if no such markings can be added.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. The program reads the input values `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and the sequence of markings `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`.
2. It checks if there are any markings that are `x` or `y` units away from each other by iterating through the markings and checking if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in the set of markings, and similarly for `y`.
3. If both `x` and `y` are found, it prints `0`.
4. If not, it tries to find a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking by iterating through the markings again and checking if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in the set of markings, and similarly for `y`.
5. If it finds such a marking, it prints `1` and the marking.
6. If it doesn't find such a marking, it prints `2` and the values of `x` and `y`.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* If `x` and `y` are both present in the markings, it prints `0`.
* If `x` is present but `y` is not, or vice versa, it tries to find a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking.
* If neither `x` nor `y` is present, it prints `2` and the values of `x` and `y`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
