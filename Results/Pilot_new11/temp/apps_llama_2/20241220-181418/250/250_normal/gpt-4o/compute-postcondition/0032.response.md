Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `x` exists in `marks_set`, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`. Either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), meaning that either a mark plus or minus `x` does not exist in `marks_set` or a mark plus or minus `y` does not exist in `marks_set` (or neither exists).**
