The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds a new element to the `new_marks` set, which is the sum of `mark` and `x`. 

The value of `mark` is `marks[1]`, because it is the second mark in `marks`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), 
`l` is still an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), 
`x` is still an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), 
`y` is still an input integer (x < y ≤ l), 
`marks` is still a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), 
`marks_set` is still a set of unique integers from `marks`, 
`mark` is still the second mark in `marks`, 
`new_marks` is a set that now contains `mark + x` in addition to any elements it may have had previously.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, `new_marks` is a set containing `marks[1] + x`**
