To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 2 marks
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`
- `mark` is the second mark in `marks`
- `new_marks` is presumably a set or list that has been initialized before this line of code (though its initialization is not shown in the given snippet).

The line of code provided adds a new mark to `new_marks` which is calculated as `mark - x`. Since `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, we can express `mark` as `marks[1]`.

So, the operation `new_marks.add(mark - x)` is equivalent to `new_marks.add(marks[1] - x)`.

Given that:
- `marks[1]` (or `mark`) is the second smallest number in the sequence `marks`, which is greater than 0 (since `marks[0] = 0`).
- `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

The value added to `new_marks` will be `marks[1] - x`, which could be negative, zero, or positive depending on the value of `x` relative to `marks[1]`. 

The state of other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`) remains unchanged by this operation. Only `new_marks` is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 2 marks
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`
- `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, which equals `marks[1]`
- `new_marks` contains at least one element which is `marks[1] - x`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` equals `marks[1]`, and `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] - x`.**
