The line of code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the `new_marks` set. 

Here, `mark` represents a value from the `marks` list, `y` is an input integer. 

The value of `n` remains the same, as an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). 

The value of `l` remains the same, as an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9). 

The values of `x` and `y` also remain unchanged, as input integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l). 

The `marks` list and `marks_set` remain unchanged. 

The state of `y_found` remains False. 

The state of `x_found` remains unchanged. 

The `new_marks` set now contains the value of `mark + y` in addition to any values it may have had before.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is False, `x_found` is unchanged, and `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y` for at least one mark in `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is False, `x_found` is unchanged, and `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y` for at least one mark in `marks`**
