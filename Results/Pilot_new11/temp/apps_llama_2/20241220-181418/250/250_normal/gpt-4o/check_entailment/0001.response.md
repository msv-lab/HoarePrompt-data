Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be correct according to the problem description. It checks if the given ruler can already measure the distances x and y by iterating through each mark and checking if adding or subtracting x or y results in another mark. If both x and y can be measured, it outputs 0. 

If either x or y cannot be measured, it attempts to find a new mark that would allow both x and y to be measured. If such a mark is found, it outputs 1 along with the new mark. 

If no such mark is found, it outputs 2 along with the values of x and y, which can be used as new marks to measure both distances.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles all possible scenarios, including when both x and y can be measured, when only one of them can be measured, and when neither can be measured. 

It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the given marks are the minimum required (i.e., the start and end of the ruler), and when the marks are already sufficient to measure both x and y. 

Therefore, I believe the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
