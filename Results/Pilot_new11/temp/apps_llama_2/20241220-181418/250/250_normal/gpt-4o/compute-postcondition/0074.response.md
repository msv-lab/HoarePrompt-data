Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If `y` is not found, then if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] + y`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] - y`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] - x` and `new_marks` contains at least `mark - x`. If none of these conditions are met and `x_found` is False, then if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] + x`. If `x_found` is True, the state remains unchanged.***
