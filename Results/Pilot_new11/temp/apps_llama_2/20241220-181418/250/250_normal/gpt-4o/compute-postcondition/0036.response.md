Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, the current value of `x_found` is False, indicating no mark plus or minus `x` exists in `marks_set`, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and the first mark in `marks`, denoted as `mark`, has a property such that either `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`.**
