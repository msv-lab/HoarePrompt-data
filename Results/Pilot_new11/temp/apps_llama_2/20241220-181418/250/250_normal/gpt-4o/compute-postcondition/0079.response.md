Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, containing no values that are either `mark + x` or `mark - x` for each mark in `marks` that meets the conditions in the loop, and no values that are either `mark + y` or `mark - y` for each mark in `marks` that meets the conditions in the loop, because no new marks were added.**
