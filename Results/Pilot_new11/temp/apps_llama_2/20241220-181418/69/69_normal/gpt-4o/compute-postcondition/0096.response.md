Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum distance between revisits to a target position determined by the given parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. It accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers). The function first calculates the final position (`final_x` and `final_y`) after all operations in `operations` are executed. If this final position matches the target position (`x`, `y`), the function returns **0**. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum distance between revisits to the target position (`x - final_x`, `y - final_y`) and returns either this minimum distance (a positive integer) or **-1** if there are no revisits to the target position. The function handles potential edge cases, including the scenario where the initial position already matches the target position and cases where the target position is never revisited.**
