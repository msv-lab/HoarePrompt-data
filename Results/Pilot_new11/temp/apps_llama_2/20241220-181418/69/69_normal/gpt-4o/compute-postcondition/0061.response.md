Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is positive infinity, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is 0, and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both. If the current value of `operations` at index `i` is 'U', then `current_x` is 0 and `current_y` is 1. If the current value of `operations` at index `i` is 'D', then `current_x` is 0 and `current_y` is -1. If the current value of `operations` at index `i` is 'L', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` is 0. If the current value of `operations` at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is 1 and `current_y` is 0.***
