The value of `final_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_x` is 0, so the new value of `final_x` is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is not 'U' and not 'D', meaning it is 'L', the current value of `op` is 'L'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is 'L'**
