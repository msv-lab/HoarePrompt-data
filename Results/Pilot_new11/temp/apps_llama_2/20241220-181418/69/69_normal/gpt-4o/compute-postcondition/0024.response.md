Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is not 'L', then `x` remains unchanged and if `op` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. In all cases, `y` remains an integer.***
