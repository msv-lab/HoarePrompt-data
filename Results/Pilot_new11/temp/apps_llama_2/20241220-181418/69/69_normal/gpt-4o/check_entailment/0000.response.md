Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not work correctly for all cases. One potential issue with this code is that it does not correctly handle the case when the target position is not reachable by changing a subsegment of the given sequence of operations.

For instance, consider the case where the given sequence of operations is "UUUU" and the target position is (100, 100). The code will return -1, which is correct. However, it does not handle the case when the target position is not reachable by changing a subsegment of the given sequence of operations, such as the case where the target position is (1, 1) and the given sequence of operations is "UUUUUU". 

Another potential issue with this code is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. The code calculates the minimum length by subtracting the position of the previous occurrence of the target position from the current position. However, this does not guarantee the minimum length, especially when the target position occurs multiple times in the sequence of operations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

The given code has a bug in the way it handles the position_map dictionary. The keys in the dictionary should be tuples of two integers (x, y), but in the line where we update the position_map, we are using `(current_x, current_y)` instead of `(current_x, current_y)`. 

However, the given program does not seem to have a clear logical error in the algorithm that handles all the given examples, so the code should be able to be fixed with minor adjustments to handle these edge cases.

Here is a sample case that demonstrates the bug:

Input:
```
6
UUUUUU
1 1
```
Output:
```
-1
```
This case should return 1 because we can change the first 'U' to 'R' to reach the target position (1,1). However, the given program returns -1, which is incorrect. 

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve finding the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position. This can be done by iterating over all possible subsegments of the given sequence of operations and checking if changing that subsegment can lead to the target position. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:

```python
def min_length(n, operations, x, y):
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            for dx in range(-1, 2):
                for dy in range(-1, 2):
                    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                        continue
                    new_x = 0
                    new_y = 0
                    for k in range(n):
                        if k >= i and k <= j:
                            if dx == -1:
                                new_x -= 1
                            elif dx == 1:
                                new_x += 1
                        else:
                            if operations[k] == 'U':
                                new_y += 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'D':
                                new_y -= 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'L':
                                new_x -= 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'R':
                                new_x += 1
                    if new_x == x and new_y == y:
                        min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the sequence of operations. It iterates over all possible subsegments of the sequence and checks if changing that subsegment can lead to the target position. If a subsegment is found that can lead to the target position, it updates the minimum length. If no such subsegment is found, it returns -1.
