Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, if the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0, otherwise, the postcondition is not defined as there is no else part.**
