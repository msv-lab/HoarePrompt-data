The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. However, `ux` is not defined in the initial state, but since `x` and `y` are input integers and there are conditions related to `lx` and `ly` based on the string `ops`, it seems there might be a typo in the problem and `ux` might be a typo for `x` or it could be related to the changes in `x` based on `lx`. Assuming `ux` is actually referring to a change related to `x` and `lx`, if the first character of `ops` is 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', then `lx` and `ly` have specific values. Since `ux` is not clearly defined but assuming it's related to the update of `x` based on `lx`, we'd consider how `x` might be affected if `ux` is actually a mistaken reference to an update of `x` based on `lx`. 

However, strictly following the given instructions without assuming `ux` is a typo for something related to `x` or `lx`, we should note that the initial state does not explicitly define `ux`. Therefore, we should consider that `ux` is being decremented from its initial undefined state or a state not provided. Since the problem doesn't provide enough context for `ux` directly, we'll consider the decrement operation in isolation.

Given the lack of clarity around `ux`, the most straightforward interpretation without assuming additional context is that `ux` is decremented, but since its initial state isn't defined in terms of `n`, `ops`, `x`, `y`, `lx`, or `ly`, we acknowledge the operation but cannot provide a numerical or direct relational update without more context.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'U', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'D', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is -1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'R', then `lx` is 1 and `ly` is 0. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1 and `ly` is 0. For any other first character of the remaining `ops`, `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged from their initial values of 0. `ux` is decremented by 1 from its initially undefined state.**
