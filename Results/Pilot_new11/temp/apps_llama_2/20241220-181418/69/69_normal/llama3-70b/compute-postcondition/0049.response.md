The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dy` was less than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy + 1`, `res` is 0, `op` is 'D', and `dy` is less than 0 but one unit closer to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `dy + 1`, `res` is 0, `op` is 'D'**
