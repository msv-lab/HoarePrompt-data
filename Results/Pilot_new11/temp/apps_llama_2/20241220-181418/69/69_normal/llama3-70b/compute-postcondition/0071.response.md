Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are recalculated. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 and `dy` is recalculated. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is increased by 1. In all other cases, `res` is increased by 1.***
