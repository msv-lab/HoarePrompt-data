According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` string. If the string has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ops` must have at least two characters and we are moving to the next character in the string. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, and we are at the next operation in the string**
