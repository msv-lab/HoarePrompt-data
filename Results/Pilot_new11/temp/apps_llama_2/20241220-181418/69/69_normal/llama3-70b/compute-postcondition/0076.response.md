The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. However, since `dx` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is introduced in this step. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` is 1, and we are at the next operation in the string**
