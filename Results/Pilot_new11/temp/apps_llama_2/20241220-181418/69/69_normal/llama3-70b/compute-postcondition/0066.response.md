The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dx` was not specified, so we can only conclude that `dx` has increased by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

 Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` is increased by 1, `dy` is recalculated.
