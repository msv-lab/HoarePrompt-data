The function accepts parameters n, sequence, x, and y, where n is a positive integer, sequence is a string of n characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the sequence of operations. If the target position (x, y) is not reachable after executing all operations (i.e., x - net x movement < 0 or y - net y movement < 0), the function returns -1. Otherwise, it counts the number of operations that do not change the difference between the target position and the current position (i.e., the operations that are not necessary to reach the target position) and returns this count. The function effectively measures the number of redundant operations in the sequence with respect to reaching the target position (x, y).
