The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers input by the user to `x` and `y`, respectively. 

The value of `n` and `ops` remains unchanged as the code does not affect them. The states of `n` and `ops` are still an input integer and a string input by the user, respectively.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` and `y` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` and `y` are input integers**
