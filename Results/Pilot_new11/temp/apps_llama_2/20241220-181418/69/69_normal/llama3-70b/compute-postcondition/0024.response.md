There seems to be a variable `ux` that is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the code provided, it appears that `ux` should be `lx` or `ly` or another variable that was not specified in the initial state, but for the sake of providing an answer, let's consider `ux` as `lx` since `ly` is also not decremented and there is no other information provided about `ux`. Also, `ux` is not mentioned in the initial state but we can replace `ux` with `lx` for the code to make sense.


The variable `lx` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 


Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is -1, `ly` is 0, `op` is the second character of `ops`**
