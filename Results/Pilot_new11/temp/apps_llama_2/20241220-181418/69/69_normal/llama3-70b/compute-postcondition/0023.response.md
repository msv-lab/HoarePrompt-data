The given code is trying to increment `ux`, but the initial state has `lx` and `ly`, not `ux`. Based on the given initial state, it seems like there might be a typo in the variable name. However, I will proceed with the given code as it is.

The code increments `ux` by 1. Since `ux` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `ux` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the second character of `ops`, `ux` is increased by 1**
