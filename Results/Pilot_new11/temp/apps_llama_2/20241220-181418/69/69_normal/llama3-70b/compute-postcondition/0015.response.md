To calculate the result, we should consider the impacts of the code on the program and the previous values of the affected variables. 

The given code is `ux -= 1`. This means that the value of `ux` is decremented by 1.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an input integer
- `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user
- `x` and `y` are input integers
- `ux` is 0
- `uy` is 0
- `lx` is 0
- `ly` is 0
- `op` is the first character in `ops`, which is 'L'
- `op` is not 'U', 'D', or 'R'

After executing `ux -= 1`, the value of `ux` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is 'L'**
