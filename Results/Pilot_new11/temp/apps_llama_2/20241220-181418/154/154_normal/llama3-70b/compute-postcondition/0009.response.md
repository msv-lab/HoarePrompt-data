Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where if `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1***
