Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in the way the dynamic programming (DP) table is being filled and used. 

In the current implementation, `dp[i][j]` seems to represent the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with time `j`, considering the first `i` subtasks. However, this approach does not correctly account for the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from any task and that completing a task gives an extra point.

Moreover, the way the final answer is calculated, `sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i))`, does not accurately reflect the scoring system. This calculation does not correctly distribute the time across tasks to maximize points, nor does it correctly count the extra points for completing tasks.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, potentially involving a 2D DP where one dimension represents the number of tasks and the other dimension represents the available time, or a more complex state representation that accounts for completed tasks and remaining time in a way that aligns with the scoring system described.

The current program fails to handle cases where the optimal strategy involves solving partial tasks from multiple problems or where the time spent on subtasks from different tasks should be optimized differently to maximize the total points earned, including the bonus points for completing tasks. 

Therefore, without a correct implementation of the dynamic programming approach or another suitable algorithm that accurately models the problem's constraints and scoring system, the program cannot be considered correct for all potential cases.
