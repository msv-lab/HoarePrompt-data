The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1), we can substitute these values into the equation.

The value of `dp[2][2]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[2][2]`) and `dp[2 - 1][2 - t[2 - 1]] + 1`, which simplifies to `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`. 

Since `t` is a sorted list and `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t[1]` is at least 1. Therefore, `2 - t[1]` is at most 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][2]` = max(`dp[2][2]`, `dp[1][2 - t[1]]` + 1), `i` is 2, and the current value of `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][2]` = max(`dp[2][2]`, `dp[1][2 - t[1]]` + 1), `i` is 2, and the current value of `j` is 2**
