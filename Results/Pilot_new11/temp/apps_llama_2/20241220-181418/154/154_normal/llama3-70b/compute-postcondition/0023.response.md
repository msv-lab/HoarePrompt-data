The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where initially `dp[2][1]` = `dp[2][0]`, `i` is 2, the current value of `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, which is `t[1]`.

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by considering the maximum value that can be obtained by including the current item `t[i - 1]` or not. The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value obtained by including the current item, which is `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[i][j]` = max(`dp[i][j]`, `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` + 1), `i` is 2, the current value of `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, which is `t[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][1]` = max(`dp[2][1]`, `dp[1][1 - t[1]]` + 1), `i` is 2, the current value of `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, which is `t[1]`.**
