According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `M` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `M` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9 and M must be greater than 2, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
