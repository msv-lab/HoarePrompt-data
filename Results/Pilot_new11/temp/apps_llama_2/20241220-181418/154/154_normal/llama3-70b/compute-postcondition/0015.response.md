The given code affects the value of `dp[i][j]`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `dp[1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9 and M must be greater than 2, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3.
