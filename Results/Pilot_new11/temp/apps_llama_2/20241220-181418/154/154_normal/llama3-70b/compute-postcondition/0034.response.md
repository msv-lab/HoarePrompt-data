According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 2 and at most 45. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[3][j]` for 1 <= `j` <= `M` represents the maximum number of items of types 1, 2, and 3 that can sum up to `j` without exceeding it, considering `t[1]` and `t[2]` as the weights of the first two types of items, and `i` is 3**
