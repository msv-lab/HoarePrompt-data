Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[1][2]` equals max(`dp[1][1]`, `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
