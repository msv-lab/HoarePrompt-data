The value of `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
