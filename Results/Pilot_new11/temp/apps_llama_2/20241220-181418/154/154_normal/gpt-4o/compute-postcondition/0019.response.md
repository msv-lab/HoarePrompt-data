The value of `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // subtask_time` and `subtask_time` is an element of list `t`, the new value of `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. 

Since `remaining_time` was an integer and `subtask_time` is also an integer, `remaining_time // subtask_time` is an integer and `(remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time` is the largest multiple of `subtask_time` less than or equal to `remaining_time`. 

The new value of `remaining_time` will be the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, which is less than `subtask_time`. 

The value of `n` is still an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is still an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is still an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is still a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is still an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is still equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is still equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` is still equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. 

However, since `remaining_time` has changed, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will also be updated as it depends on `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` will be increased by the new value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `new_remaining_time // subtask_time` where `new_remaining_time` is the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `remaining_time` equals `remaining_time % subtask_time`.**
