The given code snippet is `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. 

From the initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `0`. Therefore, `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` equals `0 * subtask_time` which is `0`.

So, `remaining_time -= 0` which means `remaining_time` remains the same.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second subtask time in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`**
