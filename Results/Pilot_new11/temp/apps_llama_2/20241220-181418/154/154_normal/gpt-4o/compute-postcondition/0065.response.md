The code increments the value of `subtasks_solved` by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`, which means it is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time. 

Since `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, its new value will be the old value plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, otherwise the loop or if statement is terminated, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`**.
