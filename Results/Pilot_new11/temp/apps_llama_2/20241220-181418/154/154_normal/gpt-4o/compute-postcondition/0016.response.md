To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given that the loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`, which contains `k` integers, we need to consider what happens when the loop moves from one iteration to the next.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`

The loop statement is `for subtask_time in t:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must not have reached the end of the list `t` yet.

Since `t` must have at least 1 subtask time and it contains `k` integers, for the loop to execute again, it implies that there are more elements in `t` to iterate over. Thus, we do not need to change the constraints on `n`, `k`, `M`, or `total_time_per_task` directly based on the loop statement alone, as these variables are not directly affected by the iteration over `t`.

However, the description of the state adjustments within the loop body suggests changes to `subtasks_solved`, `remaining_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` based on the comparison between `remaining_time` and `subtask_time`. But since we're only considering the condition for the loop to execute one more time based on the loop statement itself and not the specific operations within the loop body, we focus on the fact that there must be another `subtask_time` in `t` to iterate over.

Thus, the essential adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is that `t` must have at least one more element to process, which is inherently satisfied by the condition that `t` contains `k` integers and the loop has not yet iterated over all of them.

Given this, we need to acknowledge that the loop's ability to execute again depends on not having exhausted all elements in `t`. However, without specific details on how `subtask_time` affects other variables in a way that alters the loop's condition for continuation (since the loop condition is simply the presence of more elements in `t`), our primary adjustment is conceptual, understanding that the loop will proceed to the next element in `t`.

Therefore, considering the formal structure of the problem and the instruction to follow the format to the letter, but recognizing that the primary changes are conceptual and related to the loop's continuation condition rather than specific variable updates provided in the problem statement, the adjusted state focusing on the conditions provided and the increment of the loop (without explicit instructions on how each variable is updated within the loop body) would logically considers the progression through `t`.

State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times for the loop to execute again, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`**
