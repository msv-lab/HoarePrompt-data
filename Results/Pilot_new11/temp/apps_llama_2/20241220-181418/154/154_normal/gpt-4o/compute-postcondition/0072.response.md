Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second subtask time in `t`, if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, and `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`; otherwise, the values of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `remaining_time`, `points`, `time_used`, `complete_tasks`, `max_points`, and `subtasks_solved` remain unchanged.**
