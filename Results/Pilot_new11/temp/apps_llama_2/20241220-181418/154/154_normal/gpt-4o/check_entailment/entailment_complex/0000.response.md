Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time. The current implementation iterates over the subtask times in the order they are given and solves as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. However, this does not guarantee the optimal solution, because it does not consider the possibility of solving subtasks from different tasks in a different order.

For example, consider the input: `n = 2, k = 2, M = 4` and `t = [2, 3]`. The program will first try to complete tasks, but it cannot complete any task because the total time required to complete a task is 5, which is greater than the available time `M = 4`. Then, it will try to solve subtasks. It will solve the first subtask of the first task (time required is 2) and then it will not have enough time to solve any other subtask. So, the program will return 1.

However, the optimal solution is to solve the first subtask of both tasks, which requires a total time of 4, exactly equal to the available time `M = 4`. In this case, the program returns a suboptimal solution.

To fix this issue, the program should consider all possible ways of solving subtasks, not just the order they are given. This can be achieved by sorting the subtask times in ascending order and then solving as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. 

Also, another issue is that the program breaks the loop as soon as it finds a number of complete tasks that requires more time than `M`. However, this is not correct because it does not consider the possibility of solving subtasks from the remaining tasks. The program should continue the loop even if it finds a number of complete tasks that requires more time than `M`, because it may still be able to solve some subtasks from the remaining tasks. 

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to consider all possible ways of solving subtasks and to continue the loop even if it finds a number of complete tasks that requires more time than `M`. 

Here's an example of how the modified program could look:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            continue
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        # Sort the subtask times in ascending order
        sorted_t = sorted(t)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time
        for subtask_time in sorted_t:
            max_subtasks_for_this_time = remaining_time // subtask_time
            subtasks_solved += min(max_subtasks_for_this_time, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
            remaining_time -= min(max_subtasks_for_this_time, (n - complete_tasks) * k) * subtask_time
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    return max_points
```

However, the above solution still has a bug. It assumes that the subtasks can be solved in any order, but the problem description states that the subtasks can be solved in any order, but it should be considered that the subtasks of the same index are solved first.

So, to fix this issue, we need to consider the subtasks of the same index first. We can achieve this by using a greedy approach. We sort the subtask times in ascending order and then solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        # Create a list of subtask times for each index
        subtask_times = [t[i] for i in range(k)]
        
        # Sort the subtask times in ascending order
        sorted_subtask_times = sorted(subtask_times)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time
        for subtask_time in sorted_subtask_times:
            max_subtasks_for_this_time = min(remaining_time // subtask_time, n - complete_tasks)
            subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_time
            remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_time * subtask_time
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    return max_points
```

This solution should correctly calculate the maximum points that can be achieved by completing tasks and subtasks within the given time limit.
