Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem described. It iterates over all possible numbers of complete tasks, calculates the time used to complete them, and then uses the remaining time to solve as many additional subtasks as possible. The maximum number of points earned is tracked and returned.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program correctly calculates the total time per task by summing the times of all subtasks.
2. It iterates over all possible numbers of complete tasks, from 0 to n.
3. For each number of complete tasks, it checks if the time used to complete them exceeds the available time M. If it does, the loop breaks, as it's pointless to consider more complete tasks.
4. The program correctly calculates the points earned for the complete tasks and the remaining time.
5. It then uses the remaining time to solve as many additional subtasks as possible. This is done by iterating over the subtask times and solving as many of each subtask as possible with the remaining time.
6. The number of subtasks solved is capped at the number of remaining tasks times the number of subtasks per task, to prevent the program from solving more subtasks than there are tasks.
7. Finally, the program returns the maximum number of points earned.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:

* When M is 0, the program returns 0, as no tasks or subtasks can be solved.
* When n is 0, the program returns 0, as there are no tasks to solve.
* When k is 0, the program returns 0, as there are no subtasks to solve.

The provided examples also demonstrate the program's correctness. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly calculates that Polycarp can complete the first task and solve one subtask of the second task, earning 6 points. In the second example, the program correctly calculates that Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and solve the second subtask of two tasks, earning 7 points.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
