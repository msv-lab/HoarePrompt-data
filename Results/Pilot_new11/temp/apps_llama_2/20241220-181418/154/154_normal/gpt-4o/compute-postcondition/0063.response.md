Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, the current value of `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, otherwise the loop or if statement is terminated, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, and `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in `t`. The current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to the current value of `subtask_time`.**
