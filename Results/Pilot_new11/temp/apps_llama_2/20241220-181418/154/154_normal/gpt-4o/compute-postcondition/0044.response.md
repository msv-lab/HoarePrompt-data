The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `subtask_time` is the second element in `t` and `t` is a list of `k` integers, we know `subtask_time` is an integer and `1 <= subtask_time <= 1000000`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, 
`t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 elements, 
`total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, 
`subtask_time` is the second element in `t`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is an integer equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, 
`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` which equals `subtasks_solved + remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is an integer equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `subtasks_solved + remaining_time // subtask_time`**
