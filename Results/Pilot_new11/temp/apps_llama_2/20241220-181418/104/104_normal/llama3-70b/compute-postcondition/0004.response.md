According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is initially 0 and `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. `i` is 0, so `j` will start from 1. 

The list `a` and `max_erase` do not affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `n` must be greater than `i`. At the start of the loop, `j` is `i + 1` which is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**
