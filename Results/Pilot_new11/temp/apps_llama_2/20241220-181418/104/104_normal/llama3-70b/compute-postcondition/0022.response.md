Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `n + 1`. If all elements in `a` from index `i` to `j` form a consecutive sequence, then `max_erase` is at least 1. Otherwise, the state of `max_erase` is unchanged.***
