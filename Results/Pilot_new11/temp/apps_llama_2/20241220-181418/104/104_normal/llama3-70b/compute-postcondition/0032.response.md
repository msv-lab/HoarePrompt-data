According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 101 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 101 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 2`**
