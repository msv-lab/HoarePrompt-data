Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The given program only checks for sequences where the difference between consecutive numbers is 1, but it does not consider other possible sequences where the difference between consecutive numbers is more than 1. This results in incorrect output for some test cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 3 5 7
```
The program will output `0`, but the correct output should be `2`, because the numbers 3 and 5 can be erased, leaving the array `[1, _, _, 7]`, which can still be restored.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it only checks for sequences with a difference of 1 between consecutive numbers, but it does not consider sequences with a difference of 2 or more. This results in an incorrect output, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
