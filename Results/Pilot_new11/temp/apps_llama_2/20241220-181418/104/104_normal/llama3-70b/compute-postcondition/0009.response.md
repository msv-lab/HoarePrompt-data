To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we'll analyze the initial state and the impact of the code on it.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3.
- `max_erase` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` is greater than `i` and `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given Code:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

Analysis:
- The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (0) and the expression `j - i - 1`.
- Given `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the expression `j - i - 1` evaluates to `2 - 0 - 1 = 1`.
- Since `max_erase` was initially 0, and `j - i - 1` equals 1, `max_erase` will be updated to 1.

Output State:
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3.
- `max_erase` is 1.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 2.
- The condition that `n` is greater than `i` and `j` must be less than or equal to `n` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `n`.**
