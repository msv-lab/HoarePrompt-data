The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) as given in the initial state.

The initial state also mentions that the second line of the standard input contains `n` integers `a_i`, but this line is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the state of `a_i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the second line of the standard input contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3)**
