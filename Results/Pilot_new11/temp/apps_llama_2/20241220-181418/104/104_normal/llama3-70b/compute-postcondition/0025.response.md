Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`. If the sequence in `a` from `i` to `j` is arithmetic with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 0. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
