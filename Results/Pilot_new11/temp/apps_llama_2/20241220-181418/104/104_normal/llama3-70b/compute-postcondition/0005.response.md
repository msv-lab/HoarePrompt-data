Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`. The current value of the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is such that `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, meaning the list `a` has an arithmetic sequence starting from index `i` up to but not including index `j`.**
