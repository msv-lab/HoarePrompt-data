The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which equals `n`. 

So, `max_erase` becomes the maximum of 0 and `a[1] - n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is max(0, `a[1] - n - 1`), `i` is 1**
