The code updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1. 

Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. 

The new value of `max_erase` is `max(max_erase, a[3] - a[2] - 1)`. 

Since `max_erase` initially equals `max(max(0, a[1] - n - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)`, the updated value of `max_erase` is the maximum of `max(max(0, a[1] - n - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)` and `a[3] - a[2] - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(max(max(0, a[1] - n - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1), a[3] - a[2] - 1)`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(max(max(0, a[1] - n - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1), a[3] - a[2] - 1)`, `i` is 3**
