Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i`, then if `num` is even, `count` is 2 (which means `count` is 3 is not valid in this case, `num` % `i` == 0 and `i` equals `num` divided by `i` does not apply here as it creates contradiction, if `num` is even then `count` is 2), otherwise `count` is 4 (which means `count` is 5 is not valid in this case). If `num` is not divisible by `i`, then if `num` is even, `count` is 4, otherwise `count` is 6.***
