Postcondition: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3. If `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i`, then if `num` is even, `count` is 4, otherwise `count` is 6. If `i` is equal to `num` divided by `i`, then the state of `count` remains unchanged, so if `num` is even, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 5.**
