The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 3, so `i` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`num` is still greater than 9. 

Now, let's evaluate `count`. 
If `num` is divisible by `i` (which is now 4), then if `num` is even, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 4. 
If `num` is not divisible by `i` (which is now 4), then if `num` is even, `count` is 4. Otherwise, `count` is 6.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 4. If `num` is divisible by 4, then if `num` is even, `count` is 2, otherwise `count` is 4. If `num` is not divisible by 4, then if `num` is even, `count` is 4, otherwise `count` is 6.**
