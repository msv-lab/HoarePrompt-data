Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If `n` is a perfect square and `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is `n + 3`. If `n` is not a perfect square but is divisible by `i` and was previously updated to `n + 2`, then `res` is `n + 4`. If `n` is neither a perfect square nor divisible by `i`, the state of `res` is not updated.***
