To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the given code snippet affects them.

Given:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n`'s current value plus 1, so `i = n + 1`.
- The state of `res` depends on whether `n` is a perfect square, divisible by `(i-1)`, or neither.

The condition for `n` being a perfect square is `(i-1) * (i-1) == n`, which simplifies to `n * n == n` since `i = n + 1` and thus `i - 1 = n`. However, this simplification seems to misinterpret the original condition. The original condition should be considered as is: if `n` equals the square of its square root (which is essentially what being a perfect square means), then `res = n + 1`. Given `i = n + 1`, the perfect square condition can indeed be considered as `n` being a perfect square.

For `n` being divisible by `(i-1)`, since `i = n + 1`, `(i-1) = n`. This means that if `n` is not a perfect square but is divisible by `n` (which is every number), the condition is technically met but seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem's division condition. The intention might have been to consider divisibility in a more traditional sense, but given `i = n + 1`, any `n` is divisible by itself (`n`), so the divisibility condition simplifies in a trivial manner.

Given the code `res += 2`, we are adding 2 to the current value of `res`.

- If `n` is a perfect square, then initially `res = n + 1`, so after executing `res += 2`, `res` becomes `n + 1 + 2 = n + 3`.
- If `n` is not a perfect square but is divisible by `(i-1)` (which, based on the given, seems to apply to all `n` since `i = n + 1`), then initially `res = n + 2`, so after executing `res += 2`, `res` becomes `n + 2 + 2 = n + 4`.
- If `n` is neither a perfect square nor divisible by `(i-1)` (a condition that seems logically inconsistent with the premise that all `n` are divisible by themselves), then `res`'s state is not updated, meaning it retains its value before the execution of `res += 2`. However, given the initial state conditions, every `n` meets the divisibility criterion as described, suggesting a simplification or misunderstanding in the problem's conditions.

Considering the above, the output state must reflect the changes to `res` based on the conditions applied to `n`. However, given the logical inconsistencies and potential misinterpretations in simplifying the initial conditions, the most accurate description based on the instruction `res += 2` and assuming `res` had been initialized according to the conditions provided would be:

- If `n` is a perfect square, then `res` is updated to `n + 3`.
- If `n` is not a perfect square, given the condition as stated (and assuming a typical interpretation where divisibility by a non-trivial factor is considered), `res` is updated to `n + 4` if it was previously `n + 2`.

Given these considerations and the instruction to adhere strictly to the format, the output state reflecting the most direct interpretation of the changes due to `res += 2`, without further specification on the initial state of `res` for non-perfect squares not divisible by `(i-1)` (which seems to be an impossible condition given `i = n + 1`), is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and if `n` is a perfect square, `res` is `n + 3`, otherwise, given the logical structure, `res` would be `n + 4` if it was previously updated to `n + 2` due to divisibility conditions.**
