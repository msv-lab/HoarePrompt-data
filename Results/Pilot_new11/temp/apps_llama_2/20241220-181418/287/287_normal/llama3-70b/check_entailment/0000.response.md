Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. It appears to be counting the number of divisors of the input number `n`, which is not the same as finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is the input `7`. The expected output should be `4`, which corresponds to the weights of the splits `7`, `3 3 1`, `2 2 2 1`, and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`. However, the program calculates the number of divisors of `7`, which are `1` and `7`, and prints `2`, which is not the expected output. 

The program does not handle the logic of generating splits of `n` and calculating their weights. It seems to be using a totally different approach which doesn't align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
