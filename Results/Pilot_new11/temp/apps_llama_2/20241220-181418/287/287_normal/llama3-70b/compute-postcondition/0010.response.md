The code `res += 2` increments the value of `res` by 2. The initial state is `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `res` is an integer equal to `n`. 

After the code is executed, `res` is still an integer, but its value is now `n + 2`, which is 2 more than its initial value.

The state of `n` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer greater than or equal to 1.

The Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `res` is an integer equal to `n + 2`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `res` is an integer equal to `n + 2`**
