Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the total number of divisors of a given integer `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9. The function first takes an integer input from the user, then iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find its divisors. For each divisor found, it increments a counter `res` by 2, except when `n` is a perfect square, in which case it decrements `res` by 1 after the increment to avoid double-counting the square root. The function handles edge cases such as `n` being 1 (in which case it has only 1 divisor) and perfect squares, where the square root is counted only once. After executing the loop, the function prints the total number of divisors found, stored in `res`. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the user-inputted integer `n` and the calculated total number of divisors of `n`, which is printed as output.**
