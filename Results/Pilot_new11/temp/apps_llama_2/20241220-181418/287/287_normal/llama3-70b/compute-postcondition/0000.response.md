The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The initial state states that the input is an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9. However, the code `n = int(input())` overwrites this value with a new input. 

Since `n` is now assigned the value of `int(input())`, the range of `n` is still an integer, and it can be any integer that can be input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
