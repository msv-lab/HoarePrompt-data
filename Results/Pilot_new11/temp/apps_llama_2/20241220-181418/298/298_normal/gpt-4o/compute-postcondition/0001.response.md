The code calculates the `area` by multiplying `n` and `m` and then dividing the result by `k`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. 

The states of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by the code. A new variable `area` is introduced and assigned the value of `n * m / k`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.**
