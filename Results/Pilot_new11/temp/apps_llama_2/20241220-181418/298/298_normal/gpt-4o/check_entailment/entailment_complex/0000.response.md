Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description in all cases. The main issue lies in the calculation of the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the desired area.

According to the problem description, the function should find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) such that 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ n, 0 ≤ y1, y2, y3 ≤ m, and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to nm/k.

However, the program does not guarantee that the calculated points will form a triangle with the exact area of nm/k. The program only checks if 2 * area (which is the base or height of the triangle) is less than or equal to n or m, and then calculates the coordinates accordingly. But this approach does not ensure that the formed triangle will have the desired area.

For example, if n = 4, m = 3, and k = 3, the program will print:

YES
0 0
4 1
0 1

However, the area of the triangle formed by these points is not 4 (which is nm/k), but rather 2. This shows that the program does not always produce the correct output according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and a new approach is needed to solve the problem. The correct approach would be to find three points that form a triangle with the exact area of nm/k, which might involve more complex geometric calculations.
