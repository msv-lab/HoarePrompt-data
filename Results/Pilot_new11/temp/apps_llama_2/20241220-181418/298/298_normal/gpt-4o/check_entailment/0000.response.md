Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. 

For example, consider the input `n = 5, m = 5, k = 2`. The program calculates the area as `25 / 2 = 12.5`, which is not an integer, so it correctly outputs "NO". However, this output does not guarantee that there are no such points.

A more critical issue arises when the calculated area is an integer, but the program's approach to finding the points does not work. 

The code checks if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m`, and if so, it tries to find points that satisfy the condition. However, this approach may not always work, especially when `n` and `m` are large and `k` is small.

For instance, consider the input `n = 100, m = 100, k = 4`. The area is `100 * 100 / 4 = 2500`, which is an integer. However, `2 * area = 5000` is greater than both `n` and `m`, so the program's conditions are not met. In this case, the program should try to find other points that satisfy the condition, but it does not.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

One possible improvement to the program would be to use a more general approach to find the points, rather than relying on specific conditions. This could involve using geometric algorithms or techniques to find points that satisfy the area condition. However, implementing such an approach would require a more detailed understanding of the problem and its constraints.
