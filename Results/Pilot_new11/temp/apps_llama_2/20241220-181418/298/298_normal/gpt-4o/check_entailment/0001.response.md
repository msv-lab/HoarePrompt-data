Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to find three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. However, there are cases where the program does not work correctly.

One such case is when $n = 5$, $m = 4$, and $k = 2$. The area of the triangle should be $\frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10$. However, the program will print:

```
YES
0 0
20 1
0 1
```

This is incorrect because the point $(20, 1)$ has an x-coordinate greater than $n = 5$, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle cases where $2 \cdot area > n$ and $2 \cdot area > m$. The program should find alternative points that satisfy the area requirement and the constraints on $x$ and $y$ coordinates.

The program provided does not handle all possible cases and edge cases, and therefore, it is considered incorrect.
