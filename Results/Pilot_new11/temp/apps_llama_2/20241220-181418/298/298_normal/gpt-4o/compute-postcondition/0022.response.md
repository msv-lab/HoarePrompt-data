Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` have been printed, and '0 1' has been printed. Otherwise, `2 * area` is larger than `n`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.**
