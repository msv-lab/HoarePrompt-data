The code snippet provided prints the value of `2 * area` and `1`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not changed by this code, but a new value is printed. 

Given that `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the printed value of `2 * area` will also be less than or equal to `n`. Since `area` is not equal to `0`, `2 * area` will be a non-zero integer.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged as they are not reassigned or modified. Additionally, the previous prints of 'YES' and '0 0' are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and `2 * area` and `1` have been printed.**
