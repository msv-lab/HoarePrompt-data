The code takes input for `n`, `m`, and `k` and assigns them integer values. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9. However, after executing the code, `n`, `m`, and `k` will take the input integer values, which may or may not fall within the initially specified ranges. The input values can be any integers, but the code does not impose any restrictions on the ranges of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers**
