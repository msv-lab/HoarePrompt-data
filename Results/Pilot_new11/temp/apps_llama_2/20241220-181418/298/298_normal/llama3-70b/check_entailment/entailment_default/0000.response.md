Correctness: **True**

The given code appears to correctly solve the problem of finding three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) such that 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ n, 0 ≤ y1, y2, y3 ≤ m, and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n * m) / k.

The code first checks if n * m is divisible by k. If it's not, the code prints "NO" and exits. This is correct because the area of the triangle must be an integer.

If n * m is divisible by k, the code calculates the GCD of n and m using the functions func_1, func_2, and func_3. The function func_3 returns the coefficients x and y such that x * n + y * m = gcd(n, m), as well as the GCD itself.

The code then checks if abs(n1 * m) >= g, where n1 is the coefficient x returned by func_3. If this condition is true, the code prints "YES" and the coordinates of the three points. The coordinates are calculated such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n * m) / k.

The output hints agree with the code, and the code seems to handle all possible cases correctly. The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the given code.

It's worth noting that the code assumes that the input will be valid, meaning that n, m, and k will be positive integers and k will be greater than or equal to 2. If the input can be invalid, the code may need to be modified to handle such cases. However, based on the problem description, it seems that the input will always be valid, and therefore the code is correct.
