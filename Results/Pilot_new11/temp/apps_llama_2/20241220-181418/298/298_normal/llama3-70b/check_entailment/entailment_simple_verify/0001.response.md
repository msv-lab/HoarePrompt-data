Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be inaccurate. The annotated version reveals that the program is actually attempting to solve the problem using a combination of mathematical functions to find suitable points that satisfy the given constraints and the area requirement.

The key insight from the annotated code is that it uses the functions `func_2` and `func_3` to find integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation, which is related to the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area. The program also checks if the area $\frac{nm}{k}$ can be achieved with integer points by verifying if `n * m % k` equals zero. If not, it immediately outputs "NO". Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate and print the coordinates of the points.

The original assessment missed the significance of the functions `func_2` and `func_3` and how they are used in the context of the problem. It also failed to recognize the conditional statement that checks for the feasibility of the area and the subsequent calculation and printing of the point coordinates.

Given this new understanding and the fact that the program does indeed attempt to solve the problem as described, the refined assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
