You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of the original `a` as stated in the annotations. The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, which is an integer. The state of the program after it concludes is that it has computed and returned the GCD of the input integers, with no modifications to the input variables `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The function handles cases where `b` is 0 by returning `a`, which is a valid GCD operation. There is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code behavior, where the annotations incorrectly state that the function returns the absolute value of the original `a`, whereas the code actually computes and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of b
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns two values: `y`, which is a value returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also a return value from `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `y` is as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, providing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two values: either `(1, 0)` when `b` equals `0`, indicating that the GCD is `a` (or `b` when `a` is `0`), or the results of recursive calculations involving integer division and modulo operations for other cases. The function handles edge cases where either `a` or `b` is `0`, returning the non-zero value as the GCD and the corresponding coefficient. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it provides the coefficients `x` and `y` for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, effectively giving the GCD and its representation as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the returned values from func_2(a, b), and the result of the expression x * a + y * b, where x, y, a, and b are of unknown specific values, but a and b are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Here, `x` and `y` are the returned values from the function `func_2(a, b)`, which is called within this function. The specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which is not provided in the given code. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`. It only uses them to compute and return the specified values. Note that the function's behavior is dependent on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which might introduce additional edge cases or effects not directly apparent from the given code.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
