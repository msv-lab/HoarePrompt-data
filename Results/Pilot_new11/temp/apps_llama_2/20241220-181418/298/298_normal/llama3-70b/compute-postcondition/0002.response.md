The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. After executing the function body, it returns two values, `x` and `y`, which are obtained from another function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the values `x`, `y`, and the calculated result based on `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b, and returns the values x, y, and the result of the expression x * a + y * b.**
