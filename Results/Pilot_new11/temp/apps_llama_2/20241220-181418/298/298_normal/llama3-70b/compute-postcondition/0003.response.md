Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Here, `x` and `y` are the returned values from the function `func_2(a, b)`, which is called within this function. The specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which is not provided in the given code. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`. It only uses them to compute and return the specified values. Note that the function's behavior is dependent on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which might introduce additional edge cases or effects not directly apparent from the given code.**
