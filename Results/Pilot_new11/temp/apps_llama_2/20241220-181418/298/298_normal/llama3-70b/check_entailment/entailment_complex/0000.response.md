Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the fact that the code does not correctly handle cases where `n * m % k` equals 0, but `n` and `m` are not exactly divisible by `k`. 

In such cases, the code attempts to find integer points that satisfy the given conditions. However, it does not consider all possible cases and may fail to find valid points even when they exist. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 4`, `m = 6`, and `k = 4`. The area of the triangle should be `6`, which is achievable with points `(0, 0)`, `(4, 0)`, and `(0, 6)`. However, the code may not find these points and incorrectly print "NO". 

The issue arises because the code only checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor of `n` and `m`. If this condition is not met, it immediately prints "NO" without exploring other possibilities. 

Overall, while the code is correct in some cases, it does not cover all possible scenarios, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
