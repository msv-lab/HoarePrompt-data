Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if a given string of digits can be divided into segments with equal sums. The function `func_1` checks all possible segment lengths and attempts to divide the ticket into segments of equal sum for each length. The function `segment_sum` calculates the sum of a segment of the ticket. 

The output hints for both functions agree with the provided code and describe the expected behavior accurately. The code handles all possible cases and edge cases as described in the hints, including the case where `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`. 

The function correctly checks if the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums and returns 'YES' if such a division is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function handles all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, which covers all the required cases.

Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. The first example ticket "73452" can be divided into segments "7", "34", and "52" with equal sums, and the function correctly returns 'YES'. The second example ticket "1248" cannot be divided into segments with equal sums, and the function correctly returns 'NO'.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and examples, the program seems to be correct and meets the requirements described in the problem description.
