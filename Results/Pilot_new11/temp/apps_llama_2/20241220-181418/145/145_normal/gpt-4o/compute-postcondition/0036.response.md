The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]`, but this is no longer relevant as `current_sum` has been reset. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is 0**
