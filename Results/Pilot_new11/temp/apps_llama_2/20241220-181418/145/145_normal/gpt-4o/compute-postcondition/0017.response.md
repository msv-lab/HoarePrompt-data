The value of `current_sum` is reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2.
