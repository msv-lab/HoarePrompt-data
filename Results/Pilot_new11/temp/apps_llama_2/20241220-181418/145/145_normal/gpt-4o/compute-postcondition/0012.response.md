The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The initial value of `current_sum` was the integer value of the second digit of `ticket`, but this value is overwritten. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 1**
