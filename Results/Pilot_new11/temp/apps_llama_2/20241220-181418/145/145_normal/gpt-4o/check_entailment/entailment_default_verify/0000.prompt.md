You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to divide the ticket into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

The issue with the program is that it only checks for segments of a fixed length, which is not correct according to the problem description. The problem description states that each digit of the sequence should belong to exactly one segment, and the segments should have equal sums, but it does not specify that all segments should have the same length.

For example, if the input is "1236", the program will not be able to find a division into segments with equal sums (1+2=3 and 6), because it only checks for segments of lengths 1 and 2.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check for all possible segment lengths and combinations, not just the ones of a fixed length.

Here is a counterexample: 

Input:
4
1236

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO 

This example shows that the program does not work correctly for all cases, so its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in a ticket from a specified start index to an end index, where both indices are inclusive and within the bounds of the ticket's length. The function assumes that the ticket is a globally accessible variable and that its indices are 0-based. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are expected to be integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the number of digits in the ticket. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters or the ticket variable, so it assumes these constraints are met. The return value is the sum of the digits in the specified range. Note that the function does not handle cases where the ticket variable is not defined or is not a string of digits, and it does not account for potential overflow errors if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the return type. The function's execution does not modify the input parameters or the ticket variable; it only returns a calculated sum.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
