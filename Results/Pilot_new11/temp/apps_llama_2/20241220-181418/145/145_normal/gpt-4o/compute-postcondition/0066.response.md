The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. `n` is still an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is still a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is still 3, `target_sum` is still the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`. `i` was previously incremented by 1, and `current_sum` is still 0. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `i` is incremented by 1, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1**
