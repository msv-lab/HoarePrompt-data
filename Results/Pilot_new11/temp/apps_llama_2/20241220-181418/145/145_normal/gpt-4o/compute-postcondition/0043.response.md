Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 2. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `current_sum` keeping its previous value, calculated as the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]` plus the integer value of `ticket[2]`.***
