The code resets `current_sum` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, and `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` remains unchanged.
