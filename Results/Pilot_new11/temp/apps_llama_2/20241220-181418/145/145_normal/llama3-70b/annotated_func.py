#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in ticket are between '0' and '9'.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is even (i.e., `total_sum` % 2 == 0)

    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `segments` equals the number of segments in `ticket` where the sum of Unicode code points equals `target_sum`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the Unicode code points of the characters in the last segment that didn't sum up to `target_sum` or 0 if the last segment sums up to `target_sum`, and `digit` is the last character in `ticket`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if there are at least two segments in 'ticket' where the sum of Unicode code points equals 'target_sum', False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:This function, `func_1`, checks if a given string of digits, 'ticket', can be divided into at least two segments where the sum of the Unicode code points of the digits in each segment equals half of the total sum of the Unicode code points of all digits in 'ticket'. It returns `True` if such segments exist and `False` otherwise. The function first calculates the total sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in 'ticket' and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is not even, it immediately returns `False`. If the sum is even, it then iterates through 'ticket' to find segments that sum up to half of the total sum. The function counts the number of such segments and returns `True` if there are at least two segments, and `False` otherwise. Note that the function considers the Unicode code points of the characters, not their numeric values. For example, the character '0' has a Unicode code point of 48, not 0. The function handles strings of lengths between 2 and 100 and only considers strings consisting entirely of digits. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior is not defined by the provided annotations or code.
