Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits, `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third character in `ticket`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
