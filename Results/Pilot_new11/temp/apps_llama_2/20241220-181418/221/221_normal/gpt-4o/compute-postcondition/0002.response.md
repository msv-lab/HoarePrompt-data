The function `func` does not accept any parameters as per the given code. 

However, according to the parameter constraints, the function should consider the integers `s` and `x` such that 2 <= `s` <= 10^12 and 0 <= `x` <= 10^12. Since these parameters are not passed to the function in the provided code, we will consider the problem description.

Since there is no output description, we cannot determine the return value of the function. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func cannot be determined based on the provided information.


Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value cannot be determined based on the provided information.**
