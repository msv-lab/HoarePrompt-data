Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The problem asks to find the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers with a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. However, the provided code simply performs bitwise XOR operations between variables 'a' and 'b' with variable 'x' without considering the sum or the possible pairs.

Moreover, the code uses 'b' and 'x' before they are initialized, which would result in a NameError. The code also does not accept any parameters or return any value.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider all possible values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy the conditions a + b = s and a ^ b = x. We also need to handle cases where there are no valid pairs.

For example, when s = 9 and x = 5, the correct output is 4, which corresponds to the pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), and (7, 2). The given code does not produce this output and does not handle the problem correctly. 

A correct implementation would iterate over all possible values of 'a' and 'b', check if they satisfy the conditions, and count the valid pairs. 

A correct solution in python can look something like this:

```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This solution checks all possible pairs of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy a + b = s and counts the pairs where a ^ b = x. 

However, this code has to be modified to handle cases where s and x are large numbers. 

A correct python solution using bitwise operations can look something like this:

```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    # calculate a + b = s
    # a ^ b = x
    # a = (s + x) / 2
    # b = (s - x) / 2
    if (s + x) % 2!= 0:
        return 0
    a = (s + x) // 2
    b = (s - x) // 2
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        if a ^ b == x:
            if a == b:
                return 1
            else:
                return 2
    return 0
```
This solution checks if (s + x) is even. If it is not, there are no valid pairs. It then calculates 'a' and 'b' using the formulas a = (s + x) / 2 and b = (s - x) / 2. If both 'a' and 'b' are positive and 'a' ^ 'b' equals 'x', it counts the valid pairs. If 'a' equals 'b', there is only one valid pair; otherwise, there are two valid pairs. 

This solution handles large numbers and only checks for the existence of valid pairs, making it more efficient for large inputs.
