The code `b = s - a` assigns the value of `s - a` to `b`. Given that `s` is an input integer greater than 1 and `a` is 1, the value of `b` will be `s - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is `s - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is `s - 1`**
