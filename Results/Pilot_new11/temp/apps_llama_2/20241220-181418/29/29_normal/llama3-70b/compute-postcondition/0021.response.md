The code appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is in the format 'move {file} {i}', where `file` is the third string in the `examples` list and `i` is 3. 

The `script` list initially contains the strings f'move {examples[0]} 1' and f'move {examples[1]} 2'. After the code is executed, it will also contain the string f'move {examples[2]} 3'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing the strings f'move {examples[0]} 1', f'move {examples[1]} 2', and f'move {examples[2]} 3', `i` is 3, `file` is the third string in the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing the strings f'move {examples[0]} 1', f'move {examples[1]} 2', and f'move {examples[2]} 3', `i` is 3, `file` is the third string in the `examples` list**
