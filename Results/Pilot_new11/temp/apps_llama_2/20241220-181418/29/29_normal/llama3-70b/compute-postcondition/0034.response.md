The code prints the value of `line`, which is the second line in the `script`. The values of the variables do not change, but the value of `line` is printed to the output. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-negative integer, `files` is still a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is still a list of strings, `regular` is still a list of strings, `script` is still a list of strings that must have at least 2 lines, and the length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 lines, the length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`, `line` is the second line in the `script`, and the value of `line` has been printed**
