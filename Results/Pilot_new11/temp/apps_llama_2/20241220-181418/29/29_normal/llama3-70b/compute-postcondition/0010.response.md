The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a new tuple to the `files` list. The tuple contains the `name` and the integer representation of `type_`. 

The `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, and `type_` is a string representation of an integer (0 or 1).

Since `type_` is a string representation of an integer (0 or 1), `int(type_)` will be either 0 or 1.

The `files` list initially contains at least four tuples, including the tuple `(name, int(type_))`. After the code is executed, the `files` list will contain at least five tuples, with the new tuple being `(name, int(type_))`.

The values of `n`, `name`, `type_` are not changed by the code.

The input still consists of `n-5` lines that are still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is a string representation of an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-5` lines that are still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least five tuples, including the tuple `(name, int(type_))` twice.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is a string representation of an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-5` lines that are still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least five tuples, including the tuple `(name, int(type_))` twice.**
