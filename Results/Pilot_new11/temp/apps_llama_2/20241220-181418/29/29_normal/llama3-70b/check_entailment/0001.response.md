Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where a move operation tries to rename a file to a name that is already taken by another file. In such a case, the program should first rename the file that is currently occupying the desired name to a temporary name, and then rename the original file to the desired name. However, the given program does not perform this check and may overwrite existing files.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1
2 0
1 0
```
The program will output:
```
3
move 1 1
move 2 3
move 1 2
```
However, this will overwrite the file "1" which is already renamed to "1" in the first move operation. The correct output should be:
```
4
move 1 4
move 1 1
move 2 3
move 4 2
```
This shows that the program does not handle file name collisions correctly, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
