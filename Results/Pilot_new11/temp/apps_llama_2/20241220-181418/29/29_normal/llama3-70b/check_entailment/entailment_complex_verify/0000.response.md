Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not handle cases where the filename of a file matches the destination filename of another file. In such cases, the code will overwrite the file with the matching filename without moving it to a new location.

The annotated version of the code highlights the issue. Specifically, the line `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` in both the examples and regular loops does not check if the destination filename `i` is already occupied by another file. If it is, the file with the matching filename will be overwritten without being moved to a new location.

The corrected code provided in the original assessment addresses this issue by introducing a temporary filename and using it to move files around. This ensures that files are not overwritten and that all files are moved to their correct destinations.

The problem description requires the script to be run without overwriting any files, and the original code does not meet this requirement. Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is not correct.
