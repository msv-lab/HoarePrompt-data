The code `name, type_ = input().split()` assigns the values from the next pending line to the variables `name` and `type_`, where the line is expected to contain a string and an integer separated by a space.

Given the initial state, `n` is greater than 1, and at least one line is pending. Each line contains a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, and the string consists of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters. All strings are distinct.

After executing the code, `name` will hold the string value from the input line, and `type_` will hold the integer value (0 or 1) from the same line.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The number of pending lines decreases by 1 since one line has been processed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-3` lines that have been processed and at least one line is still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least two tuples**
