The code prints the third line in the `script`. The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer. The value of `files` remains a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value. The values of `examples`, `regular`, and `script` are not changed by the print statement. The third line in the `script` is returned and printed at the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 lines, the length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`, the third line in the `script` has been returned and printed**
