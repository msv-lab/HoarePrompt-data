Functionality: **This function processes a series of inputs consisting of a single integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing a unique string and a binary integer. The function sorts these input lines based on the binary integer in descending order, categorizes them into "examples" and "regular" files, generates a script with "move" commands for each file in a specific order, and then prints the length of the script followed by each line of the script. The script assigns a unique index to each file, starting from 1 for examples and continuing from the end of examples for regular files. The function handles cases where there are no examples, no regular files, or no files at all, producing an empty script in the latter case. Upon completion, the function has printed the total number of move commands and the commands themselves, leaving the system in a state where these commands could be executed to rearrange files according to the specified order.**
