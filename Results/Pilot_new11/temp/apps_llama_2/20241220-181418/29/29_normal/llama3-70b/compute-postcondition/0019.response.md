The `script` list is updated by appending a new string. The new string is created using an f-string, which combines the string 'move ' with the value of `file` (the second string in the `examples` list) and the value of `i` (which is 2). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing the strings f'move {examples[0]} 1' and f'move {examples[1]} 2', `i` is 2, `file` is the second string in the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing the strings f'move {examples[0]} 1' and f'move {examples[1]} 2', `i` is 2, `file` is the second string in the `examples` list**
