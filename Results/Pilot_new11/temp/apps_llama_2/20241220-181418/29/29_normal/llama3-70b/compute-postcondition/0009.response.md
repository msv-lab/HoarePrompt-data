The given code `name, type_ = input().split()` will update the values of `name` and `type_` variables.

The `input()` function accepts a line from the pending inputs, splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter, and assigns the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. 

The new `name` will be a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters. 

The new `type_` will be a string representation of an integer (0 or 1).

Since one line has been read, the number of pending lines is now `n-5`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is a string representation of an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-5` lines that are still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least four tuples, including the tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
