According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If the current iteration number is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `n-3` lines have been processed, which means the loop has executed at least 3 times (since `n-3` lines have been processed and there are at least `n` lines in total). 

Since the loop has executed at least 3 times, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current iteration number. If the loop has executed 3 times, the current iteration number is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

The state of `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current iteration number, which is 3 in this case, but since `n` is already greater than 1 and at least 3 iterations have been completed, to ensure another iteration, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is at least 4, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-4` lines that are still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least four tuples, including the tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
