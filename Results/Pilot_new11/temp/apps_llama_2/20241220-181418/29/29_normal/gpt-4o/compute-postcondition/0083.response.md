Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`. The current value of `regulars[0]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, meaning `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. The rest of the variables retain their conditions: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or its string representation may or may not be in `files_set`, `moves` is updated with the new move 'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}' appended to it if `regulars[0]` was updated, and `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` before the update. The current state of `regulars` and other variables after the potential update is accounted for, with `regulars[0]` potentially updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)` and `temp_counter` incremented by 1, while the rest of `regulars` remains unchanged.**
