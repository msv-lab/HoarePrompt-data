To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: Given that `temp_counter` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, this condition will always be true for the first iteration because `n + 1` will always be less than or equal to `2 * n` when `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`. However, the initial state does not guarantee that `str(temp_counter)` (which is `str(n + 1)`) is in `files_set`. 

Since `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, and `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with at least one filename, and given the condition that the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (which is `str(n + 1)`) is in the set of filenames (`files_set`) for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `str(temp_counter)` (or equivalently, `str(n + 1)`) must be in `files_set`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` (or `str(n + 1)`) must be in `files_set`**
