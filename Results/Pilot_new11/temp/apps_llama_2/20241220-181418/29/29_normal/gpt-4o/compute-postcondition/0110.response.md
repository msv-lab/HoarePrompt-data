To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the loop condition and the changes made to variables within the loop.

The loop condition is `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is found in the set `files_set`.

Within the loop, the only variable that is updated is `temp_counter`, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

From the output states after the loop executes a certain number of times, we can observe that:

- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not updated within the loop.
- `files` and `examples` are not directly updated within the given loop, but their initial conditions and any changes to them are dependent on operations not shown in this loop snippet.
- `target` and `i` are updated based on operations not directly shown in this loop snippet, so their final states are not directly determined by this loop alone.
- `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 until it either exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is no longer found in `files_set`.

Given this analysis, the loop will terminate when either `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or when `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. 

The final state of `temp_counter` will be the smallest value greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter) not in files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` remains unchanged, and the states of `files`, `examples`, `target`, and `i` are as updated by operations outside this loop or initially defined.**
