The code `regulars.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the `regulars` list. The value of `name` is the first part of the third `file` in the `files` list.

The initial state specifies that if the second part of the third `file` (i.e., `type_`) is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the third `file` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the third `file` at least twice.

However, the code `regulars.append(name)` changes the state of the `regulars` list by appending `name` to it. This means that regardless of the initial state of `regulars`, it will now contain at least one more occurrence of `name`.

If `type_` is equal to '1', then `regulars` was initially an empty list, so after appending `name`, it will contain `name` at least once. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `regulars` already contained `name` at least twice, so after appending `name`, it will contain `name` at least three times.

The other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 files, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third `file`, `type_` is the second part of the third `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least twice and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least once. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least three times.**
