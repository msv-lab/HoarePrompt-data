Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its previous value and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}'; otherwise, no changes are made to `moves`.**
