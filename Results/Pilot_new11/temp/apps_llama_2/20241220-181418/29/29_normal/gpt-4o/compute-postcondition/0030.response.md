To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's condition and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`. This means the loop will continue as long as `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is found in `files_set`.

Initially, `temp_counter` is set to `n + 1`. With each iteration, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

Let's consider what happens after the loop has finished executing:

1. **`temp_counter`**: The loop increments `temp_counter` until it either exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is no longer found in `files_set`. Therefore, the final value of `temp_counter` will be either `2 * n + 1` (if all string representations from `n + 1` to `2 * n` are in `files_set`) or the first value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.

2. **`n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop. It remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.

3. **`files`**, **`examples`**, **`regulars`**, and **`moves`**: The values of these variables do not change within the loop provided. `files` remains a list of tuples, `examples` remains a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` remains a list of filenames not of type '1', and `moves` remains an empty list (based on the provided loop, there is no operation that modifies these variables).

4. **`i`**: The value of `i` is 0 and does not change within the loop provided.

5. **Condition for `examples` at index `i`**: The current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`. This condition remains true as there are no operations within the loop that modify `examples` or `i`.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be described as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `temp_counter` is either `2 * n + 1` if all required string representations are in `files_set`, or it is the first value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.
- `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains 0.
- The condition regarding `examples` at index `i` not being equal to the string representation of `i + 1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` is the minimum value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` or `2 * n + 1` if all string representations from `n + 1` to `2 * n` are in `files_set`, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`.**
