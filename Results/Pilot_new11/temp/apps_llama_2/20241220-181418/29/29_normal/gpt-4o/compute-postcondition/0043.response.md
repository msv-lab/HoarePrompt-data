To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement: `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**  
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is either `n + 3` or `n + 4`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given that `temp_counter` could be `n + 3` or `n + 4`, we need to ensure that the maximum value of `temp_counter` (`n + 4`) is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This implies that `n + 4 <= 2 * n`, which simplifies to `4 <= n`. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, we just need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for this condition to hold true for any `temp_counter` value in the given range.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**  
   - The condition also requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` is in the set of filenames (`files_set`).
   - Since `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, the list must include a filename that is the string representation of the next expected value of `temp_counter`.
   - This means the list `files` needs to include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of the current `temp_counter` value.

Based on the analysis:

- `n` must be at least 4 to satisfy the first condition for any `temp_counter` in the range (`n + 3` or `n + 4`).
- `files` must include a filename that is the string representation of the current `temp_counter` value.
- Other states like `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `moves` do not directly affect the loop's condition for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is either `n + 3` or `n + 4`, `i` equals 1, and `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 2}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty**
