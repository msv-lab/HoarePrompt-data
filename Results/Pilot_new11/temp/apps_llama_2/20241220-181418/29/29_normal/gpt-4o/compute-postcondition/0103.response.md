The value of `target` is assigned the expression `len(examples) + i + 1`. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5. The `files` is still a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type. The `examples` is still a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename. The `moves`, `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `i` are unchanged as there's no new information provided in the given code snippet to alter their state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, if `regulars[i+1]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` includes an additional move operation 'move {regulars[i+1]} {target}', otherwise no changes are made to `moves`, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `regulars`, `temp_counter` updated accordingly based on the initial state description.**
