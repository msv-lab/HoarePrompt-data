The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. Given that `temp_counter` equals `i` (which is 1) initially, `temp_counter` becomes 2 after the increment operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1', `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `temp_counter` is 2**
