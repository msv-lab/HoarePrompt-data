The code `regulars.append(name)` adds the `name` to the `regulars` list. The value of `name` is the first part of `file`, which is the first file in the `files` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 file, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, `file` is the first file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`, and `type_` is not equal to '1'**
