The variable `target` is assigned the value of `len(examples) + i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `target` becomes `len(examples) + 1`. The values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `i` are not changed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`**
