The code appends a string to the `moves` list in the format 'move {filename} {temp_counter}', where {filename} is the filename at index `i` in the `examples` list and {temp_counter} is the current value of `temp_counter`. 

Since `i` equals 2 and `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', the filename at index 2 in the `examples` list is used. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or its string representation is not in `files_set`, `moves` contains the updated values based on the initial conditions, the final value of `temp_counter`, and the additional move 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or its string representation is not in `files_set`, `moves` contains the updated values based on the initial conditions, the final value of `temp_counter`, and the additional move 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}'**
