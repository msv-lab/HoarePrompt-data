Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is `n + 2` because an update occurred, `i` equals 0, and the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, thus `examples` at index `i` will be updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, and `moves` contains the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'**
