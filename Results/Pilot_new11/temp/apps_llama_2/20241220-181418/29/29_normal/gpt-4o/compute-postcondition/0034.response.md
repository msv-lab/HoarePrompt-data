Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where if the filename at index `i` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, it is updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}' if `examples[i]` was not equal to `str(i + 1)`, otherwise `moves` remains an empty list, `temp_counter` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2` depending on whether `examples[i]` was equal to `str(i + 1)`, and `i` remains 0.***
