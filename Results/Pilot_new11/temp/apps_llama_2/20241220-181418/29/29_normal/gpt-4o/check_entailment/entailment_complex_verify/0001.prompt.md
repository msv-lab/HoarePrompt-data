You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by first separating the files into examples and regular tests, and then renaming them to the required format. However, upon closer inspection, there are a few potential issues with the program.

One of the primary concerns is that the program uses a temporary counter `temp_counter` to generate temporary file names when renaming files. However, this counter is incremented after each renaming operation, regardless of whether the temporary file name was actually used or not. This could lead to situations where the program runs out of temporary file names, especially if the number of renaming operations is large.

Another issue is that the program does not handle the case where a file is being renamed to a name that is already occupied by another file. In the given code, the line `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:` is intended to find a temporary file name that is not occupied. However, this approach is not foolproof, as the `files_set` only contains the original file names and does not account for any intermediate renamings.

Here's an example of a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
3
1 1
2 1
3 0
```

In this case, the program will attempt to rename the file "3" to a temporary file name, but since "3" is already occupied, the program will fail to find a suitable temporary file name.

To fix these issues, the program would need to be modified to handle the temporary file name generation more robustly, and to account for potential conflicts between file names. 

For instance, the program could maintain a separate set of temporary file names that are currently in use, and use this set to avoid conflicts. Additionally, the program could use a more sophisticated approach to generating temporary file names, such as using a hash function or a UUID generator. 

Without these modifications, the program may not work correctly in all cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, files is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string of digits and small English letters (the filename) and an integer (the type, either 0 or 1) such that the filenames are distinct and the length of each filename is from 1 to 6 characters.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` and has been incremented based on the updates of `examples`, `i` equals `len(examples) - 1`, and `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `examples` that were updated.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)

        if regulars[i] != str(target):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type with potential updates in filenames due to move operations, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' where each filename is updated to match its target numeric filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` and has been incremented based on the updates of `regulars`, `i` equals `len(regulars) - 1`, and `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated.
    return moves
    #The program returns `moves`, which contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated to match their target numeric filenames.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of files `files`, where each file is a tuple containing a filename and a type. It then separates the files into `examples` (type '1') and `regulars` (not type '1'). The function renames `examples` and `regulars` to match expected numeric filenames (e.g., '1', '2', etc.) and generates a list of move commands (`moves`) for the updated filenames. The function returns the list of move commands. However, there are several issues with the provided code that affect its functionality: (1) the line `name, type_ = file.split()` will raise an error because `files` is a list of tuples, not strings; (2) the variable `files_set` is used but never defined; (3) the function does not handle potential errors, such as when `n` is outside the specified range or when `files` contains invalid data. Despite these issues, the function's purpose is to generate move commands to rename files to match expected numeric filenames, considering the file type and the number of files.
