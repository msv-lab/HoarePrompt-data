To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop.

The while loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`. For the loop to execute at least one time, this condition must be met.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 2 filenames.
- `i` is 1.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 2`.

We are not given the initial value of `temp_counter`, but we can infer from the condition that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute.

Since we do not have the exact value of `temp_counter`, we must consider the conditions that would allow the loop to execute. The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` implies that `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter`. 

However, the problem does not specify the initial value of `temp_counter` or the content of `files_set`. Given the provided information, we need to adjust the state so that `temp_counter` is within the bounds specified by `n` and its string representation is in `files_set`.

Considering `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^5, and assuming `temp_counter` should start at a value that allows the loop to potentially execute (given the lack of specific information about `temp_counter`), we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is such that `str(temp_counter)` can be in `files_set`.

Since `files` contains tuples of filenames and types, and assuming `files_set` is derived from `files`, for the loop to execute, `files_set` must contain at least one filename that matches the string representation of `temp_counter`. 

Given `i` is 1 and assuming `temp_counter` could be related to `i` or needs to be set to allow the loop to execute, we should consider `temp_counter` to be equal to `i` for simplicity, which is 1. This assumption is for the sake of providing a concrete adjustment, as the exact initial value of `temp_counter` is not specified.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the adjusted state considering the constraints and aiming for the loop to potentially execute would be:
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, but since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and assuming `temp_counter` starts at 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 to satisfy this.
- `files` should contain a tuple where the filename matches the string representation of `temp_counter` (assumed to be 1 for the sake of argument), meaning `files_set` should contain '1'.
- Other states (`examples`, `regulars`, `i`, `target`) do not directly affect the loop condition but are part of the overall state.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1', `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and assuming `temp_counter` equals `i` (which is 1) for the loop to potentially execute**
