`moves` is updated by appending a new move instruction. The instruction is to move the file `examples[i]` to the position `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `moves` contains its previous value and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}'**
