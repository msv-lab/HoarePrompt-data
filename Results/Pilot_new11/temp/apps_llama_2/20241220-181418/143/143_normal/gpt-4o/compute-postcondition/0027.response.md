The value of `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, where `i` is 29. So, `L` becomes `L - (1 << 29)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that `L` equals `L - (1 << 29)`, potentially reduced if initially `L` ≥ `1 << 30`, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `answer` is the minimum of `10^18` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`, with `current_cost` now being `2^30 * costs[0] + min(costs[29], 2^29 * costs[0])` if `n > 29` or more generally `2^30 * costs[0] + 2^29 * costs[0]` for `n <= 29`, considering `dp[i]` for `i >= n` equals `2^i * costs[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that `L` equals `L - (1 << 29)`, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `answer` is the minimum of `10^18` and `current_cost + (L - (1 << 29) > 0) * dp[i]`, with `current_cost` now being `2^30 * costs[0] + min(costs[29], 2^29 * costs[0])` if `n > 29` or more generally `2^30 * costs[0] + 2^29 * costs[0]` for `n <= 29**, considering `dp[i]` for `i >= n` equals `2^i * costs[0]`.**
