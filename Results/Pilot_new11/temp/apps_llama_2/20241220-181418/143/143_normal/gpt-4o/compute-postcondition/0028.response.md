Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`, `i` is 29. If `L` is initially greater than or equal to `1 << 29`, `L` is updated to `L - (1 << 29)`, `answer` is updated to the minimum of `10^18` and `current_cost + (L - (1 << 29) > 0) * dp[i]`, with `current_cost` being `2^30 * costs[0] + min(costs[29], 2^29 * costs[0])` if `n > 29` or `2^30 * costs[0] + 2^29 * costs[0]` for `n <= 29`. If `L` is initially less than `1 << 29`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
