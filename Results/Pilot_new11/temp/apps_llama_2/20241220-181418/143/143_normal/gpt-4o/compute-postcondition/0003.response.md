According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, which means `n` is already at least 1. So, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all of which are equal to `max_cost` (10^18), `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 0**
