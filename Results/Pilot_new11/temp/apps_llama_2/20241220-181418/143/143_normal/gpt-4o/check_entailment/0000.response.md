Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to find the smallest number of roubles that must be spent to buy at least L liters of lemonade. However, the program contains several errors. 

One of the main issues with the provided program is the function `func_1(n, L, costs)`. This function tries to calculate the minimum cost to buy L liters of lemonade. However, the way it calculates `dp[i]` is incorrect. The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` is not the correct way to update `dp[i]`. This line seems to be trying to use the fact that the cost of a bottle of type `i` is at most twice the cost of a bottle of type `i-1`, but this is not a valid assumption.

Another issue with the function is that it tries to find the minimum cost by subtracting the largest possible bottle from `L` and then recalculating the cost. However, this approach does not consider all possible combinations of bottles.

A correct solution would use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each possible amount of lemonade from 1 to L. For each amount, it would try to use each type of bottle and update the minimum cost accordingly.

Here's a counterexample that shows the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
2 6
10 100
```
In this case, the program outputs `20`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `20` because we should buy two 2-liter bottles for 10 roubles each and two 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each. However, the program does not consider this possibility.

Here's the correct code for this problem:

```python
def min_cost(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = (1 << (j + 1)) - 1
            if i >= volume:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(min_cost(n, L, costs))
```
This code uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each possible amount of lemonade from 1 to L. For each amount, it tries to use each type of bottle and updates the minimum cost accordingly.
