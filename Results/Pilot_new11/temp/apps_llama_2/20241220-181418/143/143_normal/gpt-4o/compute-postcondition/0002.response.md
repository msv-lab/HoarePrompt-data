The provided code `c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` modifies the state by creating a new list `c` that is a combination of the `costs` list and additional elements of `max_cost` to ensure the total length of `c` is 31.

`c` is assigned the value of `costs` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9) concatenated with a list of `max_cost` (10^18) repeated `31 - n` times. This ensures that `c` has 31 elements in total.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, `dp`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all of which are equal to `max_cost` (10^18), and `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all of which are equal to `max_cost` (10^18), and `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18)**
