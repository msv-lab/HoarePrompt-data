The code `max_cost = 10 ** 18` assigns a specific value to the variable `max_cost`. The initial state of the program defines the values of `n`, `L`, and `costs`, but this code does not affect these variables. It only introduces a new variable `max_cost` with the value `10 ** 18`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `max_cost` is 10^18**
