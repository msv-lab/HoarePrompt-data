Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, if `vol` is less than or equal to 2, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` (if `vol` is 1) and `costs[0]` (if `vol` is 2), `j` is 0, and `vol` is less than or equal to 2; if `vol` is greater than 2, then the state remains unchanged***
