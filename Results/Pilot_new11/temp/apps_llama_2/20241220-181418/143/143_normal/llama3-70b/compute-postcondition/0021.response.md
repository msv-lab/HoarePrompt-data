The code calculates the value of `vol` as `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 0, we can calculate `vol` as `2 ** 0 - 1`, which equals `1 - 1` equals `0`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0.
