According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `L`. If `i` is less than `L + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `L` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, and `j` is `n-1`**
