Precondition: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of types of bottles in the store and L is the required amount of lemonade in liters. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2,..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9), which represent the costs of bottles of different types, where a bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters.**
