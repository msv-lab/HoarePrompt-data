According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be between 1 and 30 (inclusive), it is guaranteed that the loop will execute. The variable `j` is introduced in the loop, so its state needs to be adjusted to be initialized before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
