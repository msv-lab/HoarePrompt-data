`dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. Given that `i` is 3, `vol` is 3, and `j` is 2, `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[3 - 3] + costs[2]`, which simplifies to `dp[0] + costs[2]`. 

Since `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `0 + costs[2]`, which is `costs[2]`. The current value of `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and at least 3, `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `dp[3]` is the minimum between the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]` and `costs[2]`, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3.
