The code increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `j` is at most `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list and equal to `sofas[j]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j+1` in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1**
