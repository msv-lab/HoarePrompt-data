Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the second sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the second sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the second sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the second sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas to the left of the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `top_count` is a list where the `i-th` element is the number of sofas above the `i-th` sofa plus 1 if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, otherwise it is a list where the first element is the number of sofas above the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `bottom_count` is a list, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the `j-th` sofa. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then the `i-th` element of `top_count` is the number of sofas above the `i-th` sofa plus 1. If `y1` is not greater than `y2_j` or `y2` is not greater than `y2_j`, then the state remains unchanged. Additionally, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then the `i-th` element of `bottom_count` is the number of sofas below the `i-th` sofa plus 1 and if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the `i-th` element of `left_count` is incremented by 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
