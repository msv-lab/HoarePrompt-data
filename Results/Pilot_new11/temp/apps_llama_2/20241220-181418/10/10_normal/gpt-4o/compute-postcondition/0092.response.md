Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the third sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the third sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the third sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the third sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `y1` < `y1_j` and `y2` < `y1_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1 and `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, with `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, with `left_count[i]`, `top_count`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `right_count[i]` retaining their previous values, and the rest of the variables maintaining their initial values.**
