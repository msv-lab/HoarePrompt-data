The code appends a new tuple element `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the `sofas` list. The initial state of `sofas` is a list containing two tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. After executing the code, the `sofas` list will contain three tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer from the latest input, `y1` is an input integer from the latest input, `x2` is an input integer from the latest input, `y2` is an input integer from the latest input, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing three tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
