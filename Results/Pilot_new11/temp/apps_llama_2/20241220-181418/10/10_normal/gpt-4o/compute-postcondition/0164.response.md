Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the last sofa, `cntl` is an input integer, `cntr` is an input integer, `cntt` is an input integer, `cntb` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements representing all input coordinates, `left_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `i` is the previous index plus 2, if `left_count[i]` equals `cntl` and `right_count[i]` equals `cntr` and `top_count[i]` equals `cntt` and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cntb`, then `target_sofa` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `d` is greater than `i`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
