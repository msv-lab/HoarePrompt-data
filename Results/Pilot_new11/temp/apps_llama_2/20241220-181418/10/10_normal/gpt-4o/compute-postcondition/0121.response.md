Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, and `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa, and `left_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa or the number of sofas to the left plus one if `i` equals 1, with their values updated according to the changes in `i`, `j`, and `bottom_count[i]`.**
