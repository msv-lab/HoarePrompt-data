The code snippet `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` appends another tuple element `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. 

Initially, `sofas` contains one tuple element: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. After executing the code, `sofas` will contain two identical tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing two tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing two tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
