Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `j` is at most `d-1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j+1` in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, and if `i` equals `j`, the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop***
