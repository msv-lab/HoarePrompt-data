Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The issue lies in the way it compares the coordinates of two sofas to determine their relative positions.

For example, when checking if sofa `j` is to the right of sofa `i`, the code checks if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`. However, this is not sufficient because it doesn't consider the case where sofa `j` is to the right of sofa `i` but `x1_j` is less than `x2`. A correct check should compare the minimum x-coordinate of sofa `i` with the maximum x-coordinate of sofa `j`.

A similar issue exists when checking the positions in the vertical direction.

For instance, given two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 2, 1) and (2, 2, 3, 2), the code will incorrectly determine their relative positions.

To correctly calculate the relative positions, the code should compare the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates of each sofa. 

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((min(x1, x2), min(y1, y2), max(x1, x2), max(y1, y2)))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if x2 < x1_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if x1 > x2_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y2 < y1_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if y1 > y2_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
