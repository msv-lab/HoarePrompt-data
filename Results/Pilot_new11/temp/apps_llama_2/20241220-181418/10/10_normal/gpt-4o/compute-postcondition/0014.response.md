The code initializes a list `left_count` with `d` elements, all set to 0. The initial state provides information about various variables, but only `d` is relevant to this code snippet.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the latest input integers between 1 and `n` and between 1 and `m` respectively, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuple elements, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, and `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros**
