The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are updated to be equal to the elements of the `i-th` tuple in the `sofas` list. The `i-th` tuple is `sofas[i]`. Since `i` is 1, we are looking at the second tuple in the list (because indexing starts at 0), but the problem statement says `i` is 1, so we consider it as the second element as per the given value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the second sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the second sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the second sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the second sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas to the left of the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `right_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas to the right of the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `top_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas above the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `bottom_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas below the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**
