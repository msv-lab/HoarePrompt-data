You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False** 

The issue lies in the fact that there are undefined variables `n`, `m`, `r` in the function `coverage(x, y)`. This function is supposed to calculate the coverage for a given cell `(x, y)`, but it is trying to use the parameters `n`, `m`, `r` which are only defined in the function `func_1(n, m, r, k)`.

Here is an example where the program does not work: 
If you call `func_1(10, 10, 5, 50)`, the program will throw a `NameError` because `n`, `m`, `r` are not defined in the scope of `coverage(x, y)`.

Another issue is that the function `coverage(x, y)` does not correctly calculate the coverage of a cell. It seems to be trying to calculate the number of positions where the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell `(x, y)` is covered, but it does not do this correctly.

To fix this issue, we would need to redefine the `coverage(x, y)` function to correctly calculate the coverage of a cell, and also make sure that it has access to the parameters `n`, `m`, `r`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
import heapq
import sys

def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    def coverage(x, y, n, m, r):
        return max(0, min(x + r, n) - x) * max(0, min(y + r, m) - y)

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y, n, m, r), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

print(func_1(3, 3, 2, 3))
print(func_1(12, 17, 9, 40))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the rectangular pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the square scoop and is less than or equal to the minimum of n and m, and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes and is less than or equal to the minimum of the product of n and m and 10^5.
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, and `heap` is a list of `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all positions `(x, y)` in the pond.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond.
    #   - `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
    #   - `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5.
    #   - `heap` is a list of `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all positions `(x, y)` in the pond.
    #   - `total_coverage` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop runs `k` times.
    #   - In each iteration, it pops the tuple with the highest coverage (due to the `-coverage(x, y)` in the tuple, the highest coverage becomes the smallest value and thus gets popped first from the heap) from the `heap`, and subtracts its coverage value from `total_coverage`.
    #
    #3. **Analysis of Loop Executions**:
    #   - After the loop executes once, `heap` has one less element, and `total_coverage` has increased by the value of the highest coverage.
    #   - This pattern continues for each execution of the loop, with `heap` losing one element and `total_coverage` increasing by the next highest coverage value each time.
    #   - The loop will execute `k` times if `k` is less than or equal to `n*m` and if `heap` initially contains at least `k` elements.
    #
    #4. **Output State After All Iterations**:
    #   - Since the loop runs `k` times, after all iterations, `heap` will have `n*m - k` elements left.
    #   - `total_coverage` will be the sum of the `k` highest coverage values (because in each iteration, we subtract the negated highest coverage value, effectively adding it to `total_coverage`).
    #   - `k` must be less than or equal to the minimum of `n*m` and 10^5 for the loop to execute `k` times.
    #   - If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total_coverage` remains 0, `heap` remains unchanged with `n*m` elements.
    #
    #5. **Variables Not Changing**:
    #   - `n`, `m`, and `r` do not change during the loop as their values are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with `n*m - k` tuples if `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n*m`, otherwise `heap` remains a list of `n*m` tuples, and `total_coverage` is the sum of the `k` highest coverage values if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `total_coverage` is 0.**
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average coverage per position, which is the sum of the k highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) in the rectangular pond, where k is the number of highest coverage values considered, limited by the minimum of the pond's area and 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the average coverage per position in a rectangular pond based on the k highest coverage values. It accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, representing the dimensions of the pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes. The function returns the sum of the k highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) in the pond. If k is 0, the function returns 0 or a very small value (in case total_positions is not zero) because the loop does not execute and total_coverage remains 0. If k is greater than n*m, the function will only consider n*m positions because the loop will stop after popping all elements from the heap. The function also handles the case where the pond's area (n*m) is less than 10^5, in which case it will only consider the pond's area for k. The return value represents the average coverage per position, which can be used to evaluate the distribution of coverage in the pond.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, and n, m, and r are non-negative integers where 1 <= n, m <= 10^5 and 1 <= r <= min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns a non-negative integer value that is the product of two calculated "window" sizes related to x, y, n, m, and r, where x and y are non-negative integers less than n and m respectively, and r is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of n and m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage(x, y)` calculates and returns the product of two window sizes, one related to position `x` within bounds `n` and `r`, and the other related to position `y` within bounds `m` and `r`. The window sizes are calculated as `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0))` and `(min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`, where `x`, `y` are non-negative integers less than `n` and `m` respectively, and `r` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The function handles edge cases where `x - r + 1 + 1` is less than 0, in which case the window size is calculated from 0. It also handles cases where `x + 1` or `y + 1` exceeds `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1` respectively, by limiting the window size to `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1`. The function returns a non-negative integer value, which is the product of the two calculated window sizes. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has calculated and returned this product, leaving the input variables `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r` unchanged.
