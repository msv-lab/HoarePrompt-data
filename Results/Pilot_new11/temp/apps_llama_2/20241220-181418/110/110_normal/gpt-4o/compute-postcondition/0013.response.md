The `heapq.heappush` function adds a new element to the `heap` list. The new element is a tuple containing the values `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. 

Given the initial state, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. The function `coverage(x, y)` is not defined in the problem statement, so we will leave it as is. 

The `heap` list initially includes at least `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, and after executing the code, it will also include `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of tuples including at least `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of tuples including at least `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
