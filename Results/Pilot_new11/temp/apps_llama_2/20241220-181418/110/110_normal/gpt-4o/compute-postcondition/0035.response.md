The code `total_coverage -= cov` subtracts the coverage of the popped element (`cov`) from the `total_coverage`. 

The value of `total_coverage` is updated to `total_coverage - cov`, but its previous value was already `total_coverage - cov` as given in the initial state, so this operation does not change the value of `total_coverage` from its previous state. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with one less element, `cov` is the coverage of the popped element, `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the popped element, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`, and the loop has executed 1 iteration.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with one less element, `cov` is the coverage of the popped element, `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the popped element, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`, and the loop has executed 1 iteration.**
