To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 2,
- `m` is a positive integer,
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`,
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5,
- `heap` is a list of `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`,
- `x` is 2,
- `y` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

The impact of this code on the program is the addition of a new tuple to the `heap` list. The tuple is `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `x` is 2 and `y` is 0. Thus, the new tuple is `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`.

The `coverage` function is not defined in the given problem, so we will keep it as is in our output state.

The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code snippet. The state of `heap` is updated by adding a new tuple to it.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 2,
- `m` is a positive integer,
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`,
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5,
- `heap` is a list of `m+1` tuples, with `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, and an additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`,
- `x` is 2,
- `y` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of `m+1` tuples, with `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, and an additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0**
