You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False** 

The issue lies in the fact that there are undefined variables `n`, `m`, `r` in the function `coverage(x, y)`. This function is supposed to calculate the coverage for a given cell `(x, y)`, but it is trying to use the parameters `n`, `m`, `r` which are only defined in the function `func_1(n, m, r, k)`.

Here is an example where the program does not work: 
If you call `func_1(10, 10, 5, 50)`, the program will throw a `NameError` because `n`, `m`, `r` are not defined in the scope of `coverage(x, y)`.

Another issue is that the function `coverage(x, y)` does not correctly calculate the coverage of a cell. It seems to be trying to calculate the number of positions where the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell `(x, y)` is covered, but it does not do this correctly.

To fix this issue, we would need to redefine the `coverage(x, y)` function to correctly calculate the coverage of a cell, and also make sure that it has access to the parameters `n`, `m`, `r`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
import heapq
import sys

def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    def coverage(x, y, n, m, r):
        return max(0, min(x + r, n) - x) * max(0, min(y + r, m) - y)

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y, n, m, r), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

print(func_1(3, 3, 2, 3))
print(func_1(12, 17, 9, 40))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `coverage(x, y)` calculates and returns the product of two window sizes, one related to position `x` within bounds `n` and `r`, and the other related to position `y` within bounds `m` and `r`. The window sizes are calculated as `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0))` and `(min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`, where `x`, `y` are non-negative integers less than `n` and `m` respectively, and `r` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The function handles edge cases where `x - r + 1 + 1` is less than 0, in which case the window size is calculated from 0. It also handles cases where `x + 1` or `y + 1` exceeds `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1` respectively, by limiting the window size to `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1`. The function returns a non-negative integer value, which is the product of the two calculated window sizes. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has calculated and returned this product, leaving the input variables `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r` unchanged.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
