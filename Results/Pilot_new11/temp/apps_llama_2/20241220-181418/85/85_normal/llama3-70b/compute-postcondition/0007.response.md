The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `n` is a multiple of 10, then `ans` is 1, otherwise, `ans` is 0. So, after incrementing by 1, if `n` is a multiple of 10, then `ans` becomes 2, otherwise, `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 2, if `n` is a multiple of 10, then `ans` is 2, otherwise, `ans` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 2, if `n` is a multiple of 10, then `ans` is 2, otherwise, `ans` is 1**
