The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 3, and `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 3, and `ans` is increased by 1**
