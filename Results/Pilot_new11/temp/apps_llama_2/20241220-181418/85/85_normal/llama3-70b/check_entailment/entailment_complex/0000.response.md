Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The problem states that Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. The program, however, checks if the sum of `i` and `n - i` is a multiple of 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus 1, which does not necessarily correspond to the maximum possible number of trailing nines.

In particular, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not ensure that the sum of the costs of the two shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines. It only checks if the sum is a multiple of a certain power of 10, which may not be the case for the maximum number of trailing nines.

For example, consider the case where `n = 50`. The maximum possible number of trailing nines is 2, which is achieved by the pair of shovels with costs 49 and 50, resulting in a sum of 99. However, the program's condition does not capture this case, as `49 + 1 == 50` and `50 % 10 ** (len(str(50)) - 1) == 50 % 10 ** 1 == 0`, but the number of trailing nines is not maximized.

To fix this, the program should find the maximum possible number of trailing nines that can be achieved by any pair of shovels, and then count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. This requires modifying the condition and the loop to correctly identify the maximum number of trailing nines and count the corresponding pairs. 

Here is an example of how to fix the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_trailing_nines = 0
    max_trailing_nines_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        sum_of_costs = i + (n - i)
        trailing_nines = 0
        while sum_of_costs % 10 == 9:
            trailing_nines += 1
            sum_of_costs //= 10
        if trailing_nines > max_trailing_nines:
            max_trailing_nines = trailing_nines
            max_trailing_nines_count = 1
        elif trailing_nines == max_trailing_nines:
            max_trailing_nines_count += 1
    print(max_trailing_nines_count)
```
This corrected version of the program finds the maximum possible number of trailing nines and counts the number of pairs that achieve this maximum, as required by the problem description.
