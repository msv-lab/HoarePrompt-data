The code increments `ans` by 1. The value of `n` is at least 2 and is an input integer, `i` is 1, and the last digit of `(i + (n - i))` is 0. The expression `(i + (n - i))` simplifies to `n`. Since the last digit of `n` is 0, `n` is a multiple of 10. 

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by the code. The value of `ans` becomes `ans + 1`, which is `0 + 1`, so `ans` becomes 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 2 and is a multiple of 10, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
