The value of `n` is adjusted by performing integer division by 10. Since `n` is one less than the number of tens in the original number and must be adjusted to be one less than a multiple of 10, after the division, `n` will be one less than the number of hundreds in the original number, divided by 10. The state of `max_9s` is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is one less than the number of hundreds in the original number divided by 10, `max_9s` is 2**
