The print statement has the effect of outputting the value of `pairs` to the console, which is equal to `(n + 1) * max_9s`. The values of the variables `max_9s`, `n`, and `pairs` do not change. 
The value of `pairs` has been returned at the output state and is equal to `(n + 1) * max_9s`.
Output State: **`max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `pairs` is equal to `(n + 1) * max_9s` and the value of `pairs` which is `(n + 1) * max_9s` has been returned**
