The function `func` does not accept any parameters. 

However, based on the provided constraints, there is an integer `n` that represents the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^9.

To determine the return value, we need the output description which is missing. 

If we were to follow the format of the previous examples, the output description would be necessary to complete the functionality description. 

Assuming a hypothetical output description for illustration purposes:

Output: The function returns the maximum number of shovels that can be bought, given the constraint that `n` is the total number of shovels available.

Functionality: **The function returns the maximum number of shovels that can be bought, given the constraint that `n` is the total number of shovels available, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^9.**
