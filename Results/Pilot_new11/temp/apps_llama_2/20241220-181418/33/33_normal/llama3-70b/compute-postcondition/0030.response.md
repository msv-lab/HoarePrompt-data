The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer and `curr_lat` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only express `curr_lat` as its original value minus `t / 111.195`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `curr_lat` is its original value - `t / 111.195`**
