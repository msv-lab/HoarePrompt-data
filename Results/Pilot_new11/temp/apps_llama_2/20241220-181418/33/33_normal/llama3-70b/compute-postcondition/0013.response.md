Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains 90 and we proceed to the next iteration with `dir` being either 'East' or 'West'.**
