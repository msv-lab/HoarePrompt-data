The given code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This statement does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string. If `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the current value of `curr_lat` is 90. The string 'NO' has been printed, and the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90.**
