The code prints 'NO' to the console. Given the initial state, 'NO' is printed when `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90] or when `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, the program has printed 'NO' to the console, `curr_lat` is either outside the range [-90, 90] or -90 with `dir` not being 'North', and the program has terminated**
