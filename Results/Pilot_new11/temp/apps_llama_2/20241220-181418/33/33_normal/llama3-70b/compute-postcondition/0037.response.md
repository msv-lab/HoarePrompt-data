The code snippet prints 'NO', which indicates that the program has terminated due to `curr_lat` being less than -90 or greater than 90. As a result, the execution of the program stops, and no further updates to the variables occur.

Output State: **The program has terminated, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, and `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. The variable values remain unchanged as the program terminated after printing 'NO'.**
