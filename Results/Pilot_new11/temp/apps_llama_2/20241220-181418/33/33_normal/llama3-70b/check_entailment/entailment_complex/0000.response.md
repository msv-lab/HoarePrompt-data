Correctness: **True**

The given Python program accurately follows the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of parts in the journey (`n`) and the time and direction for each part, just as specified in the problem description.

2. **Simulating Journey**: The program simulates the journey by maintaining the current latitude (`curr_lat`). It correctly updates the latitude based on the direction and time of each part of the journey. The approximation of 111.195 kilometers per degree of latitude is used, which is a standard conversion factor.

3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks the conditions specified in the problem description:

   - If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South.
   - If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North.
   - The journey must end at the North Pole.

4. **Handling Invalid Movements**: If any invalid movement is detected (e.g., moving away from the pole when already at it, or resulting in a latitude outside the range of -90 to 90 degrees), the program immediately prints 'NO' and exits.

5. **Conclusion**: Finally, the program checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees North (i.e., back at the North Pole) and prints 'YES' if so, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program ignores east and west movements, as specified in the problem description, since they do not affect the latitude.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all specified conditions, it is correct. 

Note that, as you mentioned, we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the program's correctness is evaluated based solely on its adherence to the problem description, without considering potential edge cases related to invalid input.
