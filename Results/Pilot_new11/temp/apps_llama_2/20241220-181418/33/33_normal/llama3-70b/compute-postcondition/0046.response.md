The code affects the variable `curr_lat` by incrementing it by `t / 111.195`. The previous value of `curr_lat` is unknown, but we know that `t` is an input integer and the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`**
