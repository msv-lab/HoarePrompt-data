The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately, regardless of the current state of the variables. The values of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, `t`, `dir`, and the printed output 'NO' are not affected by the `exit()` function, but the program execution stops. The conditions related to `curr_lat` and `dir` are no longer relevant because the program terminates.

Output State: **The program has terminated. `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, and 'NO' has been printed.**
