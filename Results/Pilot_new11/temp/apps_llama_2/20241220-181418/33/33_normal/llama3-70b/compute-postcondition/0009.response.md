The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. The value of `t` is an integer, but its exact value is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South', and the input direction `dir` is not 'North'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'**
