The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution stops. The string 'NO' has been printed, and the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string, 'NO' has been printed, the program has been terminated, and the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, specifically if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, otherwise `curr_lat` is 90**
