Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` pairs of values must exist for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is not 'South', then if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `valid` is `False` when `position` is 0 or 20000, otherwise the state of `valid` and `position` depend on the conditions related to `dir` and `t` as initially specified.**
