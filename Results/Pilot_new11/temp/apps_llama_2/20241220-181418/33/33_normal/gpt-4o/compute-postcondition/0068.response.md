Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and `valid` is `True`, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console and `valid` remains `False`.**
