Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is 'South', `position` is 0, and if the sum of `position` and `t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is False, otherwise the postcondition remains the same as the precondition with `valid` still True**
