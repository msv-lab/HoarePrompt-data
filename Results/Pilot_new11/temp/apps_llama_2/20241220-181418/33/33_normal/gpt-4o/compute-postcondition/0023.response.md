Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is not 'North'. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `t` and `valid` is False if `2t` is greater than 20000, otherwise `valid` is True. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then if `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `valid` is False if `position` is 0 or 20000, otherwise `valid` remains True and the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position` are unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'West', 'East', nor 'South', then the state of the program remains unchanged.***
