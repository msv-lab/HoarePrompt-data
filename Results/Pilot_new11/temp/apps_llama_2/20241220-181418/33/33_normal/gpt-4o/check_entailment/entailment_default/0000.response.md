Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to accurately implement the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks for the three conditions: 

1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The code correctly handles these conditions by checking if the position is at the North or South Pole before moving in any direction, and by checking if the final position is at the North Pole. The function also checks for boundary conditions and does not allow Limak to move West or East when at the boundary positions 0 or 20000.

The output hints agree with the code and help to verify that the code is indeed checking all the required conditions. The provided examples also demonstrate that the code produces the expected output for different scenarios.

Since the code accurately implements the conditions and handles the boundary cases, and there are no apparent cases where it would not work as expected according to the problem description, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
