The given Python code sets the `valid` variable to `False`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

So, `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `position` is either 0 or 20000, and `valid` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is False**
