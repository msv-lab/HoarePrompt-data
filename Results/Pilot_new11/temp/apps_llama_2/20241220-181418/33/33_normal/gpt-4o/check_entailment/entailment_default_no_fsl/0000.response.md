Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description, handling all potential cases as specified. It checks for the three main conditions: 

1. If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as preventing Limak from moving West or East from the poles, ensuring that the total distance traveled does not exceed the maximum allowed (20000 km from North to South), and validating the position after each move.

All examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. The program updates the `position` variable based on the direction and distance of each move and checks for any invalid conditions. If any condition is not met, the `valid` flag is set to `False`, and the program prints "NO" at the end. If the journey is valid and ends at the North Pole, the program prints "YES".

The output hints provided match the behavior of the program, indicating that it correctly evaluates the journey based on the provided steps and constraints. Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, meeting all the specified conditions.
