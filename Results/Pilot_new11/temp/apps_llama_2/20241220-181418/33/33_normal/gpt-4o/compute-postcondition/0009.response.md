Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is 'North', if `position` is less than `t`, then `position` is an integer and `valid` is `False`. If `position` is not less than `t`, then the state of `position` and `valid` remains unchanged.**
