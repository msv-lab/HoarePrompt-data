Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum. The program takes an integer input representing a camera angle in degrees and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 (inclusive) by taking the modulus of the input with 360. If the normalized angle is 0, the function prints and returns 0. For non-zero normalized angles, it calculates and prints a value between 0 and 3 (inclusive) using the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. 

The provided output hints and examples suggest that the program behaves as expected. For instance, when the input is 60, the program correctly outputs 1. Similarly, when the input is -60, the program outputs 3, which aligns with the problem description. 

The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` seems to be correctly implemented to categorize the camera angle into one of four quadrants. The modulus operation ensures that the angle is normalized within the range of 0 to 359 degrees, and the formula then calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

Given that the program handles the provided examples correctly and the output hints align with the code, it appears that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
