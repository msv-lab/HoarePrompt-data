The camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), and `x` is an input integer. The code `x = x % 360` updates the value of `x` to be the remainder of `x` divided by 360.

Since the remainder of any integer divided by 360 is between 0 and 359 (inclusive), `x` will now be an integer between 0 and 359 (inclusive). However, because the original value of `x` could be negative, we need to consider the effect of the modulo operation on negative numbers. In Python, the modulo operation on a negative number `a` and a positive number `b` returns a result with the same sign as `b` (which is positive in this case), and the magnitude of the result is the remainder of `abs(a)` divided by `b`. 

But since `x % 360` is equivalent to `x - 360 * (x // 360)`, and `x // 360` is the integer division of `x` by 360 (which truncates towards negative infinity for negative `x`), the actual effect for negative `x` is to add or subtract multiples of 360 until `x` falls within the range [-359, 0) or [0, 359], depending on the magnitude and sign of `x`. 

For instance, if `x` was originally -370, `x % 360` would equal -10 because `x` is adjusted by adding 360 to reach the smallest non-negative value less than 360 (which doesn't apply here since the modulo operation adjusts the value directly). If `x` was originally 370, `x % 360` would equal 10 because 360 is subtracted once from `x`.

Thus, after the operation `x = x % 360`, `x` will indeed be an integer, but its range considering original negative values would technically span from -359 (for an original `x` of -1) up to 359 (for an original `x` of 719 or any value that when divided by 360 leaves a remainder of 359). However, all values are adjusted to fall within this modular range.

The state of the camera angle is not affected by this operation, as it only modifies the value of `x`.

Output State: **The camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive)**
