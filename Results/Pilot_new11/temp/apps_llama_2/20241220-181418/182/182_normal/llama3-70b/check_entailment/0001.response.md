Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

- The program first takes the input angle and computes the equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 360 degrees using the modulo operator (`x = x % 360`).
- It then handles the case where the input angle is equivalent to 0 degrees (i.e., no rotation is needed), in which case it outputs 0.
- For non-zero angles, it uses the formula `print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)` to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical.
- This formula works because it effectively computes the smallest multiple of 90 degrees that is greater than or equal to `x + 90`, and then takes the remainder modulo 4 to get the minimum number of turns.
- This approach works for all possible input angles, including negative angles and angles greater than 360 degrees, because the program first reduces the angle to its equivalent value within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.
- The program correctly handles the sign of the input angle (positive for clockwise rotation and negative for counter-clockwise rotation), as demonstrated by the provided examples.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I was unable to find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
