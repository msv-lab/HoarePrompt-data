Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all potential cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the number of turns required. The current implementation, `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, does not accurately determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

For example, when the input is 60, the expected output is 1, but when the input is -60, the expected output is 3. However, the code's logic is flawed and does not correctly calculate the number of turns for all possible input angles, especially negative ones and angles that would require multiple turns to reach the nearest 90-degree mark.

The correct approach would involve finding the angle that, when subtracted from the input angle (adjusted for the initial rotation if necessary), results in the smallest absolute difference with the nearest multiple of 90 degrees. This requires considering all four quadrants (0-89, 90-179, 180-269, 270-359 degrees) and their reflections, as well as accounting for the clockwise rotation performed by the FPGA hardware.

A correct implementation would need to consider these factors more accurately, potentially involving conditional statements to handle different ranges of input angles and ensure that the minimum number of turns is always calculated correctly, regardless of the input's sign or magnitude. 

To fix this issue, one could reconsider the problem and solve it by thinking about the goal of minimizing the angle between the "true up" and the actual up direction after rotation. This involves finding the remainder of the division of the absolute value of the input angle by 360, then determining the closest 90-degree mark in the clockwise direction based on this remainder. However, the code's current approach does not accurately capture this logic for all potential input angles, leading to the conclusion that its correctness is **False**.
