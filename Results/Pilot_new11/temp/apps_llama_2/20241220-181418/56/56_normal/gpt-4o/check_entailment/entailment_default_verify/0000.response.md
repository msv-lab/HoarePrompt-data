The original assessment states that the program is correct. After analyzing the code and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. 

The program correctly checks whether it's possible to set exactly `k` bits to 1 in the binary representation of a non-negative integer `n` by potentially shifting bits to the right. The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to 1 in `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it tries to meet the requirement of having exactly `k` bits set to 1 by shifting the rightmost set bit to the right and duplicating it until `k` bits are set. 

The output hints provide examples of the code functionality and handle potential edge cases. The code also maintains the lexicographically largest sequence by sorting the bits in descending order after the splitting process.

The reason why I think the original assessment is accurate is that the code handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for the provided examples. It's also efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only requires a single pass over the binary representation of `n`. The code is also well-structured and easy to understand, which supports the conclusion that it is correct.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
