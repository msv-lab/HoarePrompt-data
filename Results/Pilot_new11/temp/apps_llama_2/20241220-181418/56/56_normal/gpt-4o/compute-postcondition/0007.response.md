Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`. If the 61st bit of `n` (from the right, 0-indexed, but since we are at position 60 and bits are usually 0-indexed, it's actually the 61st bit) is 1, then `bits` is a list containing 60 and `i` is 60. Otherwise, `bits` remains an empty list and `i` is still 60, as there are no changes made in the else part, but since there is no else part in this case, `bits` remains an empty list and `i` is still 60.**
