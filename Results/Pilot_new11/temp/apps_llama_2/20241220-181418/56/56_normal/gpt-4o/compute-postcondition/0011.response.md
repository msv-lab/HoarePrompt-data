To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(60, -1, -1):`, which means `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

Given the current state: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits,
- `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, 
- `k` is less than or equal to `n`, 
- `i` is 59.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1. So, `i` becomes 58.

If the 59th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60 and must contain 59. 
If the 59th bit of `n` is 0, then `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60.

Since `i` is now 58, we need to consider the 58th bit of `n`. 
- If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` must contain 58 (in addition to any other bits it may contain, including 59 and possibly 60).
- If the 58th bit of `n` is 0, then there is no requirement for `bits` to contain 58, but it still may or may not contain 60, and if the 59th bit of `n` is 1, it must contain 59.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58. If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60 and must contain 58 (and 59 if the 59th bit of `n` is 1). If the 58th bit of `n` is 0, then `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60 (and must contain 59 if the 59th bit of `n` is 1).**
