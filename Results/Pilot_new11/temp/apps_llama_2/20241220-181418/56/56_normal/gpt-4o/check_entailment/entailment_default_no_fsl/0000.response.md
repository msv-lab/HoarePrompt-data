Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. 

One example where the code does not work as expected is when `n` can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2 with a larger exponent than 60, which is the limit used in the code to initialize the `bits` list. For instance, if `n = 2^61 + 2^0` and `k = 2`, the function should return `Yes` followed by `61 0`, but the code will not be able to handle this case because it only considers exponents up to 60.

Another issue is that the code does not correctly find the lexicographically largest sequence. For example, if `n = 2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0` and `k = 5`, the code should return `3 3 2 1 0`, but it may not always find this sequence because it modifies the `bits` list by popping and appending smaller values, which does not guarantee the lexicographically largest sequence.

Additionally, the code does not check if `n` can be expressed as the sum of `k` powers of 2 with the smallest possible maximum exponent. For example, if `n = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0` and `k = 4`, the function should return `Yes` followed by `4 1 1 0`, but the code may not find this sequence because it only checks if the number of bits set to 1 in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, but does not consider the actual values of the exponents.

Overall, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
