To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits.
- `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `i` is 58.
- The composition of `bits` depends on the values of the 58th and 59th bits of `n`. If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` must contain 58 (and 59 if the 59th bit of `n` is 1) and may or may not contain 60. If the 58th bit of `n` is 0, then `bits` must contain 59 (if the 59th bit of `n` is 1) and may or may not contain 60.

The code provided is `bits.append(i)`, where `i` is 58.

Given that `i` is 58, this code will append 58 to the `bits` list.

So, after executing `bits.append(i)`, the updated information is:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits.
- `k` remains a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to `n`.
- `i` remains 58.
- `bits` now definitely contains 58, in addition to any other elements it may have contained based on the initial conditions related to the bits of `n`.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios for the bits of `n`:
- If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` must contain 58 (which it now does due to the append operation) and may contain 59 (if the 59th bit of `n` is 1) and may or may not contain 60.
- If the 58th bit of `n` is 0, then `bits` now contains 58 (due to the append operation), must contain 59 if the 59th bit of `n` is 1, and may or may not contain 60.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58, `bits` is a list that contains 58 and may contain 59 (if the 59th bit of `n` is 1) and may or may not contain 60.**
