The code appends the value of `i` to the `bits` list. The initial state of `bits` is an empty list, and `i` is 60. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The new state of `bits` is a list containing `i`, which is 60. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing 60, `i` is 60, and the current value of the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `n` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing 60, `i` is 60**
