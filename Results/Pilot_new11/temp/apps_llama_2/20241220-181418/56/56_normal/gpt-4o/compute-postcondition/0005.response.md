Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60. The current value of the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `n` is 1, meaning `(n >> i & 1)` equals 1**
