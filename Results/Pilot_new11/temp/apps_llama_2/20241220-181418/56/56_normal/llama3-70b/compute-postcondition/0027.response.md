The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `n` is given as `n - 2`, but this seems to be an incomplete expression as it doesn't specify what `n` equals to. However, based on the instruction to be as specific as possible and considering `n` is mentioned as `n - 2`, it implies `n` itself is not directly modified by the given code but its expression or relation might have been previously established. Since `i` is the variable being directly affected, its new value is `i + 1`. The state of `n` or its expression doesn't change due to the given code snippet. Therefore, considering `n` was in a state described as `n - 2` before the execution (implying its value or a relation involving it), and `i` being incremented, the output state reflects the change in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**
