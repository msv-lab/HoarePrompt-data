According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 2`, which means `n` has been decreased by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after being decreased by 2. Therefore, the initial value of `n` must have been at least 2 more than its current value to ensure that the loop can execute again after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is `n - 2` and `n - 2` must be greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1**
