Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list, `i` is an integer, `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. Otherwise, the state of the program remains as it is before the if condition, as there is no specified action for the else part.**
