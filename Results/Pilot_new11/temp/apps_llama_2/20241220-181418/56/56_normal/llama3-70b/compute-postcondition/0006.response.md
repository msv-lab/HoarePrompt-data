To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `n > 0`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an input integer,
- `k` is an input integer,
- `n` is larger than or equal to `k`,
- `a` is an empty list, and
- `i` is 0.

The condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already stated to be larger than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` needs to be strictly greater than 0, as the condition is `n > 0`. The value of `k`, the emptiness of list `a`, and the value of `i` do not affect the loop's condition directly.

Therefore, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is that `n` must be greater than 0. The conditions regarding `k`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they do not impact the loop's ability to execute based on its condition.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, and `i` is 0**
