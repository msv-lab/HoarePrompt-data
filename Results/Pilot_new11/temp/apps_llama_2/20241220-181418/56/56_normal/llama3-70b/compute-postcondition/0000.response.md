The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided. Since `map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, `n` and `k` are assigned these integer values.

Given the initial state that `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^5, the new values of `n` and `k` are the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
