Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the cases correctly when the number of rows is 1. According to the problem description, if there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row. However, the given code does not take this into account.

For instance, consider the test case where n = 1, m = 3, k = 8, x = 1, y = 1. The code calculates max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked as follows:
- max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) = (8 + (1 - 1)) // (2 * 1) = 8 // 2 = 4
- min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1)) = max(1, 4 - (1 - 1)) = max(1, 4) = 4
- sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1) = (8 + 1 - 1) // (2 * 1) + ((8 + 1 - 1) % (2 * 1) >= 1 - 1 + 1) = 8 // 2 + (8 % 2 >= 1) = 4 + (0 >= 1) = 4

However, when n = 1, the correct calculation for max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked should be:
- max_asked = k // m = 8 // 3 = 2 (integer division)
- min_asked = k // m = 8 // 3 = 2 (integer division)
- sergei_asked = k // m = 8 // 3 = 2 (integer division) since y = 1

So, for the test case n = 1, m = 3, k = 8, x = 1, y = 1, the code does not produce the correct output. 

The correct code should consider the case where n = 1 separately to handle the scenario where there is only one row in the class. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 1:
        max_asked = k // m
        min_asked = k // m
        sergei_asked = k // m
    else:
        max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n - 2)
        min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
        sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n - 2) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```
This code will handle the case where n = 1 correctly and produce the expected output. 

This should be ran against a set of test cases (edge case n=1, n>1 to test them against all potential edge cases also normal test with multiple rows).
