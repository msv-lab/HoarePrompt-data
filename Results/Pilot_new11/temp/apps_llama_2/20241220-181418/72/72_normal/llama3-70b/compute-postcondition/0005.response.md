The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the seating arrangement, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of questions asked, and `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `n` and 1 <= `y` <= `m`, representing Sergei's row and position. 

However, the output of the function is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be fully described.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, where n and m are positive integers, k is a non-negative integer, and x and y are positive integers within the range of n and m, but the return value is undefined.**
