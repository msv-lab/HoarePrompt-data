Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

The problem description requires that the teacher asks pupils in a specific order, first from left to right in each row, then from right to left in each row, changing direction when reaching the end of a row. However, the program does not take into account this specific order when calculating the number of times each pupil is asked.

For example, when calculating `max_asked`, the program simply uses the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which does not accurately represent the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. This formula assumes that the teacher asks pupils uniformly across all rows and columns, which is not the case.

Similarly, when calculating `min_asked`, the program uses the formula `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, which also does not accurately represent the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked.

When calculating `sergei_asked`, the program uses the formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which also does not accurately represent how many times the teacher asked Sergei, given the specific order in which the teacher asks pupils.

To accurately solve this problem, the program would need to simulate the teacher's asking order and keep track of how many times each pupil is asked, or find a more sophisticated mathematical formula that takes into account the specific asking order. 

Here is an example of when the program fails:
Input: 
3 2 5 2 1
The program's output will be: 
1 1 1
However, the correct output is: 
2 1 1 

This is because the pupil at row 2, column 1 is asked twice (once when the teacher is moving down and once when the teacher is moving up), but the pupil at row 1, column 1 is only asked once, and the pupil at row 3, column 1 or column 2 is also only asked once. The correct output should reflect the correct number of times each pupil is asked, given the teacher's specific asking order. 

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
