The value of `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycles` is `k // m`. 
`n` is a positive integer input, 
`m` is a positive integer input, 
`k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, 
`x` is `x - 1`, 
`y` is an integer input minus 1, 
`full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, 
`full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycles` is `k // m`, 
`remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, 
`min_questions` is `full_cycles` which equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `min_questions` is `k // m`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `min_questions` is `k // m`**
