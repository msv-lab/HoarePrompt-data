Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, initially `x` is an integer input, then `x` is updated to `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1, if `n` > 1, then the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, the current value of `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, the current value of `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, the current value of `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`, the current value of `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, the current value of `sergei_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`, if `n` == 1, then the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `m`, the current value of `full_cycles` is `k // m`, the current value of `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, the current value of `min_questions` is `k // m`, the current value of `max_questions` is `k // m`, the current value of `sergei_questions` is `k // m`. The current value of `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`.**
