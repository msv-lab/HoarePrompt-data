Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1. If `n` > 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`, and `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` == 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, `min_questions` is `k // m`, and `max_questions` is `k // m`.**
