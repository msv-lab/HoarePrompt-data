The function calculates and prints the integer division result of `(n + k - 1)` by `(k * 2 + 1)`, and a list of numbers in arithmetic progression, where the first term is 1, the common difference is `(k * 2 + 1)`, and the number of terms is determined by the integer division result. The function accepts two input parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive and non-negative integers respectively, with constraints 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000. The function handles edge cases where `l` is 0 (i.e., `(n + k - 1)` is less than `(k * 2 + 1)`), in which case it prints 0 and an empty list. The final state of the program includes the printed integer division result and the list of numbers in arithmetic progression.
