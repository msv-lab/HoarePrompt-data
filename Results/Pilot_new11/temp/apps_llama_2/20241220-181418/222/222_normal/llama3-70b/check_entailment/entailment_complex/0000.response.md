Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to find the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers with a given number of closest skewers `k` from each side that are turned in one step. The program calculates the minimum number of actions `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, which is the ceiling of the division of `n` by the length of the skewers that can be turned in one step (`k * 2 + 1`).

The program then generates a list of skewer numbers to turn over, starting from 1 and incrementing by `k * 2 + 1` for each iteration. This ensures that every skewer is turned over in the minimum number of actions.

The program handles the edge case where `l` is 0, in which case it prints 0 and an empty list. This is correct because if `n + k - 1 < k * 2 + 1`, it means that the number of skewers is less than the length of the skewers that can be turned in one step, so no actions are needed.

The program's output meets the problem description's requirements, printing the minimum number of actions and the list of skewer numbers to turn over.

In every potential case, the program follows the problem description and calculates the minimum number of actions and the list of skewer numbers to turn over correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
