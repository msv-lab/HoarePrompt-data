Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. The logic behind the code is sound, as it calculates the minimum number of turns required to cover all skewers by dividing the total number of skewers (`n`) by the number of skewers that can be turned over in a single operation (`k * 2 + 1`).

The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when `l` is 0, in which case it prints 0 and an empty list. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For instance, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the code outputs `2` and `1 6`, which matches the expected output.

Additionally, the code's logic can be verified by analyzing the arithmetic progression of the skewer numbers that are turned over. The first term is always 1, and the common difference is `k * 2 + 1`, which ensures that each turn covers a non-overlapping set of skewers.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, including edge cases and examples, it can be concluded that the code is correct.
