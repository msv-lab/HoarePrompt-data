Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and provides the correct skewer numbers to turn over at each step. 

Here's why:

1. The formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates the minimum number of actions needed. This is because each action can turn over `k * 2 + 1` skewers, and we need to turn over `n` skewers in total. This formula ensures that we perform the minimum number of actions necessary to cover all `n` skewers.

2. The loop `for i in range(l)` generates the skewer numbers to turn over at each step. By adding `1` to `i * (k * 2 + 1)`, we ensure that we start turning over skewers from the leftmost side and move towards the right, which aligns with the problem description.

3. The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is less than or equal to `k * 2 + 1`, the program will perform only one action, which is the correct approach. 

Since the program handles all possible cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. 

Note that the program does not explicitly check if the final skewers are all turned over, but the calculation and algorithm used guarantee that this is the case. If an example were provided where the program does not work as expected, it would be possible to identify a specific case where the program fails. However, based on the problem description and the code provided, the program appears to be correct.
