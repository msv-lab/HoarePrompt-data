The value of `l` is assigned the result of the expression `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. The states of the variables `n` and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`**
