The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` by taking two integer inputs from the user. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000, the new values of `n` and `k` will be the input integers. 

However, it is important to note that the code does not check if the input integers are within the specified ranges. If the input integers are within the ranges, then the output state will be the input values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
