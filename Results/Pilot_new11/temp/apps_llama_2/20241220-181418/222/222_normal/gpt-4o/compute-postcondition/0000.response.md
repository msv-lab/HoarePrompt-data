The code snippet `positions = []` initializes a new empty list called `positions`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `k` but introduces a new variable `positions` into the program's state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 1000`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is an empty list `[]`.**
