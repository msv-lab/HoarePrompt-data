The code appends the value of `i` to the `positions` list. The value of `i` is 1, so the list `positions` becomes `[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 1000`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1]`, `i` is 1**
