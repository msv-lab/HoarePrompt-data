To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the pattern from the given examples and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
while i <= n:
    positions.append(i)
    i += 2 * k + 1
```

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The value of `i` increases by `2 * k + 1` after each iteration.
2. The list `positions` appends the current value of `i` at each iteration.
3. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and increments by `2 * k + 1` each time, the values appended to `positions` will be an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`. The sequence starts at 1, so the terms can be represented as `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1),...`.

The loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `n`. To find the number of iterations, let's consider the inequality that must hold for the loop to execute at least once: `1 <= n`. For the second iteration, `1 + (2 * k + 1) <= n`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 2 <= n`. For the third iteration, `1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1) <= n`, which simplifies to `4 * k + 3 <= n`.

Generalizing, for the `m`th iteration, the condition is `1 + (m - 1) * (2 * k + 1) <= n`, which simplifies to `(2 * k + 1) * m - 2 * k <= n`. Solving for `m` when the loop terminates gives us an idea of how many times the loop iterates.

However, without explicitly solving for `m`, we can deduce the final state based on the patterns observed:

- `i` will be the first value greater than `n` in the sequence `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1),...`.
- `positions` will contain an arithmetic sequence starting at 1, with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, and the last term will be less than or equal to `n`.
- `n` and `k` will retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.

To precisely define the output state, consider that the loop adds terms to `positions` until `i` would exceed `n`. Thus, the number of terms added to `positions` depends on `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest value greater than `n` in the arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, `positions` is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `2 * k + 1` starting at 1 and ending at the largest term less than or equal to `n`, `n` and `k` retain their original values.**
