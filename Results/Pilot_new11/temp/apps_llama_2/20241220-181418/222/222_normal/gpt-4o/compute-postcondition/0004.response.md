The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`, where `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`. The new value of `i` is `i + 2 * k + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 2` because the initial value of `i` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 1000`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1]`, `i` is `2 * k + 2`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 1000`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1]`, `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
