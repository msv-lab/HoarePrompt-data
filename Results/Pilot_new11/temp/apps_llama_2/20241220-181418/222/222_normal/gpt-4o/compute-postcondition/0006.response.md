The code appends the value of `i` to the `positions` list. The value of `i` is `2 * k + 2`, and the initial value of `positions` is a list `[1]`. 

So, `positions` becomes `[1, 2 * k + 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2]`, `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
