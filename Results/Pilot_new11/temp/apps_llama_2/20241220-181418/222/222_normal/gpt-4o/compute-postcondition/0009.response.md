The code appends the value of `i` to the list `positions`. The initial state is: `n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2]`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`. 

After running the code, `positions` becomes `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`**
