The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates under the conditions that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, without specific information about the output, we cannot directly describe the return value.


Given that the output details are missing, we can only outline the constraints:


The function `func` operates under the parameter constraints that x and y are integers where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. 
However, since we lack the specific output conditions (e.g., what the function returns based on x and y), we cannot provide a complete description of its functionality.


If we were to follow the format based on typical expectations for such a function (which might involve returning a value based on x and y), we might structure our response as follows, but please note this is speculative without specific output details:


Functionality: **The function operates with the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return values are not defined.**
