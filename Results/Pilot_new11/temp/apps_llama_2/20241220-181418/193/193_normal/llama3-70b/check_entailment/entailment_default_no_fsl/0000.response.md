Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` by changing one side at a time, ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate. However, the provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the specific constraints and rules of transformation (e.g., keeping the triangle non-degenerate and changing sides one at a time).

A counterexample can be seen in the first example given in the problem description, where `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The correct minimum number of steps is `4`, as demonstrated by the transformation sequence `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`. However, the code would simply output `3`, which is the absolute difference between `6` and `3`, not accounting for the required steps to maintain a non-degenerate triangle during the transformation.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements described in the problem for every potential case.
