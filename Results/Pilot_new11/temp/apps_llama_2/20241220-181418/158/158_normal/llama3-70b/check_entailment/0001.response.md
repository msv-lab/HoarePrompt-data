Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The key to this program is the line where it calculates `min_lemon`, which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available quantities of apples and pears.

The formula `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons used is within the limits imposed by the quantities of apples and pears, given the required ratio of 1:2:4. After determining `min_lemon`, the program then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is `min_lemon` (for lemons) + `min_lemon * 2` (for apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (for pears).

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including when Nikolay can't use any fruits because the quantity of one type of fruit is insufficient to meet the required ratio, in which case `min_lemon` will be 0, resulting in a total of 0, which aligns with the problem description.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by this program:

- For input 2, 5, 7, `min_lemon` is 1 (limited by the lemons and the ratio), so the total is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
- For input 4, 7, 13, `min_lemon` is 3 (limited by the lemons and the ratio), so the total is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.
- For input 2, 3, 2, `min_lemon` is 0 (limited by the pears), so the total is 0.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all provided examples correctly, it seems to be a correct solution.
