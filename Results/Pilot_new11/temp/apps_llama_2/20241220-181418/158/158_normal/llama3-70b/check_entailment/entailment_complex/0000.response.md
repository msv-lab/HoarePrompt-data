Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The problem description requires the function to read the number of lemons, apples, and pears from the user and calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote in a ratio of 1:2:4.

2. The function reads three positive integers from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, which matches the problem description.

3. The function calculates the minimum quantity that can be used to make a lemon-apple-pear combination using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, where `a` is the number of lemons, `b` is the number of apples, and `c` is the number of pears. This formula ensures that the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is 1:2:4, which matches the problem description.

4. The function prints the total quantity of the combination, which is the sum of the minimum quantity of lemons, twice the minimum quantity of lemons (representing apples), and four times the minimum quantity of lemons (representing pears). This calculation is correct because it ensures that the total number of fruits used is the maximum possible while maintaining the required ratio.

5. The program assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, which is in line with the problem description.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct for every potential case.
