Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes three positive integer inputs: `a` (number of lemons), `b` (number of apples), and `c` (number of pears).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is limited by the minimum of the available lemons (`a`), half of the available apples (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the available pears (`c // 4`). This is done using the line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
3. The program then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by the corresponding ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). This is done using the line `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
4. Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of lemons, apples, or pears is limited, the program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used and the corresponding total number of fruits.
* When the number of lemons, apples, or pears is more than enough to cook the compote, the program still calculates the correct total number of fruits.
* When the number of lemons, apples, or pears is not enough to cook the compote (e.g., not enough pears), the program correctly prints 0, as the minimum function will return 0.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid input cases.
