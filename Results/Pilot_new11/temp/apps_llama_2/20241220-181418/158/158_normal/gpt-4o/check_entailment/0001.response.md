Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given recipe. 

Here's why:

1. It correctly calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of the number of lemons available (`a`), half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`). This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons, apples, or pears.

2. It correctly calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing the results.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it checks all three types of fruits to determine the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which in turn determines the maximum number of apples and pears that can be used. This approach ensures that the ratio of lemons to apples to pears is always 1:2:4, as required by the recipe.

The provided examples demonstrate this:

- In the first example, `max_lemons` is 1, so the total number of fruits is 1 (lemon) + 2 (apples) + 4 (pears) = 7.
- In the second example, `max_lemons` is 3, so the total number of fruits is 3 (lemons) + 6 (apples) + 12 (pears) = 21.
- In the third example, `max_lemons` is 0 because there are not enough pears, so the total number of fruits is 0.

The program handles all possible cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
