The variable `c` is updated to be an input integer. The previous constraint that `c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1000 is no longer valid. The values of `a` and `b` are still input integers and are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
