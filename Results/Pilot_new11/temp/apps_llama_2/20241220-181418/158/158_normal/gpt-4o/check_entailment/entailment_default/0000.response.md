Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make a fruit combination in the ratio 1:2:4. It does this by first determining the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is the minimum of the available lemons, half of the available apples, and a quarter of the available pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for the lemons themselves), 2 (for the apples), and 4 (for the pears), and prints the result. 

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including when there are not enough apples or pears to make a combination, in which case it will print 0. The code also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description. 

For instance, in the first example with 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is 1, so the total number of fruits is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which is the correct output.

In the second example with 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is 3, so the total number of fruits is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21, which is the correct output.

In the third example with 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is 0, because there are not enough pears to make a combination, so the total number of fruits is 0, which is the correct output.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases and produces the expected output.
