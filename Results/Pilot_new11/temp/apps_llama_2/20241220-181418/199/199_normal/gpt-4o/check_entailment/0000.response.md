Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The key idea is that in order to form a rectangle, two pairs of parts must have the same length, say `a` and `b`. The program correctly calculates the remaining length `rem` and checks if it is even and greater than 0, which means the remaining two parts can have the same length.

The condition `if a!= rem // 2` ensures that it is impossible to form a square, as if `a` equals `rem // 2`, all four parts would have the same length, forming a square.

The program iterates over all possible values of `a` and correctly counts the number of valid combinations.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and no counterexamples could be found. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
