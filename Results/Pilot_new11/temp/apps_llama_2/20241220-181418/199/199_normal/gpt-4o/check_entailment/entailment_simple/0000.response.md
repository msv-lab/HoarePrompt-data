Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. The program only considers cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 6, which is a necessary condition because Pasha has to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts, and each part must have some positive integer length.
2. The program uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`, where `a` represents the length of two parts of the stick. This is a valid approach because if `a` is greater than `n // 4`, it would not be possible to form four parts with positive integer lengths.
3. Inside the loop, the program calculates the remaining length `rem` of the stick after subtracting `2 * (a + b)`, where `b = a`. It then checks if `rem` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`. If all these conditions are met, it increments the count of valid combinations. This is a correct approach because it ensures that the four parts can be arranged to form a rectangle but not a square.
4. Finally, the program returns the count of valid combinations, which represents the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that meet the problem's conditions.

The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 4 because the problem statement assumes that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. However, the problem statement does mention that Pasha has to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts, and the program correctly handles this by only considering cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 6.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem and meets the problem description.
