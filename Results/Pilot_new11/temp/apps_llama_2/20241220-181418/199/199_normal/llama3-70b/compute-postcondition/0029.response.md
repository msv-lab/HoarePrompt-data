Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1, otherwise `ways` remains the initial total number of distinct `b` values, and `n`, `a`, `b` retain their initial values**
