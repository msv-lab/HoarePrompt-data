To determine the output state, we first need to understand the initial conditions and how the given code snippet affects these conditions.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 8.
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is 4.
- If `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1, otherwise `ways` remains the initial total number of distinct `b` values.

The condition `2 * (a + b)` equals `n` can be evaluated as follows:
- `2 * (a + b) = 2 * (3 + 4) = 2 * 7 = 14`.
- Since `n` is greater than 8 and in this case, `n` would be 14 for the condition to be true, we consider `n` could be 14 for the condition to hold.

Now, evaluating the condition:
- `a` is not equal to `b` (`3 ≠ 4`), so the first part of the condition is true.
- If `n = 14`, then `2 * (a + b) = n` is true.

Thus, if `n = 14`, `ways` would be the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1.

The given code snippet is `ways += 1`. This means, regardless of the initial condition, `ways` will be incremented by 1.

So, the output state will be:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 8 (specifically, it could be 14 for the initial condition to be relevant, but its exact value isn't changed by the code).
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is 4.
- `ways` is incremented by 1 from its initial value. If `n = 14`, initially `ways` would have been the total number of distinct `b` values plus 1, but after the increment, it's that value plus 1. If `n ≠ 14`, then `ways` was the initial total number of distinct `b` values and is now that value plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, if `n` equals 14, `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 2, otherwise `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1**
