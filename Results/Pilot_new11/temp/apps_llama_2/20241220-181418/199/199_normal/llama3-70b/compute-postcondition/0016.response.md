The code increments the `ways` variable by 1. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `a` is not equal to `b`, `b` starts at 2, and the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 equals `n`. After incrementing `ways` by 1, the new value of `ways` is the previous number of distinct `b` values plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `a` is not equal to `b`, `b` starts at 2, the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 equals `n`, and `ways` is the previous number of distinct `b` values plus 1**
