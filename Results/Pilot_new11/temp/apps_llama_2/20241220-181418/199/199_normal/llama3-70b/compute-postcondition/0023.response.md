Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ways` remains the same as before the if statement, which is increased by 1 if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.***
