Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Rectangle formation condition**: The program checks for the condition where it's possible to form a rectangle using the parts of the stick, but not a square. This condition is met when the sum of the lengths of two pairs of parts equals the total length of the stick, i.e., `2 * (a + b) == n`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parts. The program correctly identifies these pairs by iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the specified ranges.

2. **Distinct pairs condition**: The program counts distinct pairs of integers `a` and `b` where `a` is not equal to `b`. This ensures that the pairs represent different ways to split the stick into four parts, as required by the problem description.

3. **Range and bounds conditions**: The program correctly implements the range and bounds conditions for `a` and `b`. The outer loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n // 2`, and the inner loop iterates over `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. This ensures that `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified ranges and that `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.

4. **Counter and return condition**: The program maintains a counter `ways` to store the total number of distinct pairs that satisfy the conditions. The counter is incremented by 1 for each valid pair found. The program returns the total count of distinct pairs, which represents the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that meet the problem description's requirements.

Overall, the program accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description, ensuring that it correctly counts the number of distinct ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.
