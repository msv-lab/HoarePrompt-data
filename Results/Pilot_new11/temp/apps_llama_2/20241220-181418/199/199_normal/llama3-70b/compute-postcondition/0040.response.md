Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs of integers `a` and `b` where `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2`, `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 0, as the conditions `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 2` and `b` ranging from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1` cannot be satisfied. If `n` is an even number greater than 1, the function returns the count of such distinct pairs. If `n` is an odd number greater than 1, the function also returns the count of such distinct pairs, but since `2 * (a + b)` must equal `n`, which is odd, no pairs will satisfy this condition, resulting in a count of 0. The function effectively counts the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of two even numbers, where the two numbers are not equal and are less than or equal to `n // 2` and `(n - a) // 2` respectively.**
