According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the range defined by `a` and `n`. If `b` is less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` starts at 2. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1. So, `b` becomes 3. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 3**
