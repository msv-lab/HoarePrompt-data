To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions provided.

1. The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4.
3. We need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time.

Given the loop condition, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Since `b` is 4 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` should be incremented by 1, making it 5.

Now, let's verify if the new `b` value is within the loop's range. The upper limit of the range is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. We know `n` is greater than 8 and `a` is 3. For `b` to be 5, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be greater than 5.

Thus, `n - a` must be greater than 8 (since `(n - a) // 2 + 1 > 5` implies `(n - a) // 2 > 4`, which implies `n - a > 8`), and since `a` is 3, `n` must be greater than 11.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than 11 (to ensure `(n - a) // 2 + 1` is greater than 5, allowing `b` to be 5).
- `a` remains 3.
- `b` is incremented to 5.

Considering the conditions regarding `ways`, if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is updated based on whether `n` equals 14 or not. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration and not the outcome of the loop body, we do not need to calculate the new value of `ways` at this point. The focus is on ensuring the loop can execute again based on the iteration variable `b` and the loop's range condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 11, `a` is 3, `b` is 5**
