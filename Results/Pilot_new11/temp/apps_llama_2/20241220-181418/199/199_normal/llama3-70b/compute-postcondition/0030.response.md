According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `b` is less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` becomes 4. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `b` must be less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Since `a` is 3 and `n` is greater than 7, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again. Thus, `n` must be greater than 8 to satisfy this condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1, otherwise `ways` remains the initial total number of distinct `b` values**
