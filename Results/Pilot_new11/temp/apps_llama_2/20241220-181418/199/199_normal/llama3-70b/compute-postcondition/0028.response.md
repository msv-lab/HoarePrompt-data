To calculate the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet. 

Initially, `n` is a positive integer greater than 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, but it's stated that the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b`, which seems contradictory given the values provided. However, we'll proceed under the assumption that despite the initial values of `a` and `b` being equal, the condition implies that there's a consideration for when `a` and `b` can be different due to some unspecified context or additional conditions not directly provided in the snippet. Also, 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, which means `2 * (a + b) = n`. Given `a = 3` and `b = 3`, `n` would be `2 * (3 + 3) = 12`, fulfilling the condition that `n` is greater than 7.

The code snippet `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. 

Given the conditions and the operation performed:
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 7, specifically `n = 12` based on the initial values of `a` and `b`.
- `a` remains 3.
- `b` remains 3, though the condition suggests there's an expectation for `a` and `b` to be unequal under certain contexts.
- The sum of `a` and `b` times 2 equals `n`, so `2 * (a + b) = n` still holds.
- `ways`, initially the total number of distinct `b` values, is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, and `ways` is the initial total number of distinct `b` values plus 1**
