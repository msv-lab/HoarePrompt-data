`h` and `n` are reassigned using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `h` and `n` are now integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The initial constraints are that `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. Since the actual input values are not provided, we can only state that `h` and `n` are integers within these ranges.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h`; `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
