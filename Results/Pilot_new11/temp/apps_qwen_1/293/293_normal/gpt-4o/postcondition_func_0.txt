The function reads two integers \( h \) and \( n \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq h \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^h \). It then converts \( n \) into its binary representation (excluding the leading '1') and traverses a binary tree of height \( h \) according to the binary digits of \( n \). For each binary digit, it simulates moving left (if the digit is '0') or right (if the digit is '1') in the tree. The function counts the number of nodes visited during this traversal. After completing the traversal, it prints the count of visited nodes.
