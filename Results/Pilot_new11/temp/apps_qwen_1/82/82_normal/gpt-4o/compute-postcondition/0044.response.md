The code updates `current_lcm` to the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. However, since `func_2` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. But we know that `new_a` is assigned the value of `a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` remains as `(b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`.

The states of the other variables (`b`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is `(a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far, and `min_k` is the minimum \( k \) value found so far such that `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `new_candidate < min_k`).**
