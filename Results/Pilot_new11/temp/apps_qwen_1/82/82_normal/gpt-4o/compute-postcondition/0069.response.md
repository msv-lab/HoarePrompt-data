The code updates `current_lcm` to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The function `func_2` is called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments, which are defined as follows:

- `new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `diff // k`, `new_b`, and `min_lcm`, `min_k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`; `k` is a positive integer; `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`; `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**
