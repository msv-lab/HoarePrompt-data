Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a = (a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `b = b + new_candidate - 1`
- `new_b = (b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`
- `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm = current_lcm`
- `min_k = candidate`
- The loop updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`).

### Loop Body:
The loop iterates over `candidate` in the list `[k, diff // k]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute again if `candidate` in the list `[k, diff // k]` is not equal to the current value of `candidate` used in the last iteration.
   
2. **Updating Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are updated based on `new_candidate` and `candidate`.
   - `new_b` is calculated based on `b` and `candidate`.
   - `current_lcm` is updated using `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
   - If the conditions `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`) are met, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated.

### Next Iteration:
- Since we are considering the next iteration of the loop, we need to assume the loop will use the other candidate from the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- If the current `candidate` was `k`, the next candidate will be `diff // k`, and vice versa.

### Adjusted States:
- `a` will be recalculated based on the new candidate.
- `b` will be updated based on the new candidate.
- `new_b` will be recalculated.
- `current_lcm` will be updated based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if the conditions are met.

### Updated State:
Assume the current `candidate` was `k`. The next candidate will be `diff // k`.

- `a` will be recalculated using the new candidate.
- `b` will be updated.
- `new_b` will be recalculated.
- `current_lcm` will be updated.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if necessary.

Since we don't know the exact values of `k` and `diff // k`, we can generalize the states:

**State:**
- `a = (a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` where `candidate` is the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- `b = b + new_candidate - 1` where `candidate` is the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- `new_b = (b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate` where `candidate` is the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` where `candidate` is the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if the conditions are met.

To provide a concrete example:

**State:**
- `a = (a + new_candidate - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)` if the current `candidate` was `k`.
- `b = b + new_candidate - 1` if the current `candidate` was `k`.
- `new_b = (b + new_candidate + (diff // k) - 2) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)` if the current `candidate` was `k`.
- `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` if the current `candidate` was `k`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if the conditions are met.

Thus, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is `(a + new_candidate - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + (diff // k) - 2) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `min(current_lcm, min_lcm)` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `(diff // k) < min_k`), and `min_k` is `min((diff // k), min_k)` if the conditions are met.**
