The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. The previous value of `min_k` is unchanged, and `candidate` is assigned to `min_k`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`, and `candidate` is `candidate`.**
