The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means that `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is the new value of `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`.**
