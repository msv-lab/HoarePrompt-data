The code `a, b = b, a % b` performs a tuple unpacking operation. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 1. Let's break this down:

1. Calculate `a % b`: Since `a` is 1 and `b` is 1, `1 % 1` equals 0.
2. Assign the result to `b`: Now `b` is 0.
3. Assign the original value of `b` (which was 1) to `a`.

After these operations, the new values are `a` is 1 and `b` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 0**
