The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, where `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10. It calculates the total distance traveled over `t` time units given initial speed `v_1`, final speed `v_2`, and a constant acceleration `d`. For each time unit from 1 to `t-1`, the speed is determined as the minimum of either the previous speed plus `d` or a linearly decreasing value starting from `v_2` and decreasing by `d` per unit time. Finally, it prints the total distance traveled.
