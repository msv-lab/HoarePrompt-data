`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**
