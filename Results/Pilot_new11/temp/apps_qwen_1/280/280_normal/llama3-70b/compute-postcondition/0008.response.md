Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\)
   - `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\)
   - `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
   - `max_speed` is calculated as the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`
   - `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`
   - `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`
   - `min_length` is `min_speed * t`
   - `i` is `t - 1`

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
   ```

   - The `min_speed` variable is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - `min_speed` is updated based on its current value plus `d` and the value of `max_speed`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, we need to express the new value of `min_speed` in terms of the original values.

- If `min_speed + d <= max_speed`, then `min_speed` remains `min_speed + d`.
- If `min_speed + d > max_speed`, then `min_speed` is set to `max_speed`.

Given this, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\), `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
