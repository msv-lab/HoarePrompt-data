The code `visited[x] = True` changes the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. However, the precondition requires that `visited[p[2] - 1]` must be False at the start of the next iteration. Since the current state does not provide the value of `p[2]`, we cannot directly update `visited[p[2] - 1]` without knowing its exact value. But we know that `visited[x]` is now `True`.

Given this, the only change in the state is `visited[x]` becoming `True`. The precondition about `visited[p[2] - 1]` being False remains unchanged because the code only affects `visited[x]`.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is True, visited[p[2] - 1] must be False at the start of the next iteration.**
