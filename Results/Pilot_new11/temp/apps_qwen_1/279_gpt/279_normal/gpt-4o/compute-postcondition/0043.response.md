Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). If `not visited[i]` is true, `i` is marked as visited, and `cycle` containing elements from 1 until the last element `x` (where `x` is `p[x] - 1`) is appended to `cycles`. All elements in `cycle` are marked as `True` in the `visited` list. If `not visited[i]` is false, no changes are made to the `visited` list or `cycles`.***
