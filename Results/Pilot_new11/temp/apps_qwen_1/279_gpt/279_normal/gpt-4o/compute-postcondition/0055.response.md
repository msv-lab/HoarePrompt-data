Let's break down the given state and the `while` loop condition to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `visited[x]` is True
  - `visited[p[2] - 1]` is False
  - `cycle` contains `x`
  - `x` is `p[x] - 1`

- Loop Condition:
  ```python
  while not visited[x]:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `not visited[x]` is `True`, meaning `visited[x]` must be `False` for the loop to continue.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `visited[x]` is currently `True`.
   - For the loop to continue, `visited[x]` must be `False`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since `visited[x]` must be `False` for the loop to continue, we need to change this state from `True` to `False`.

### Final State:
- `visited[x]` must be `False`.
- Other states (`visited[p[2] - 1]` is False, `cycle` contains `x`, `x` is `p[x] - 1`) remain unchanged because they are not relevant to the loop condition.

### Answer:
State: **`visited[x]` must be False**
