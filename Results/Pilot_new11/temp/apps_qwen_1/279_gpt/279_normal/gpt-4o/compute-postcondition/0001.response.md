The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This affects the `data` variable, which is now assigned the result of this split operation. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all p_i are unique), `b` is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.**
