`best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. Given that `t` is 4, `best_t` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and 5 if they are greater than 4, otherwise it is 0, `min_cost` is the value of `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 4.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and 5 if they are greater than 4, otherwise it is 0, `min_cost` is the value of `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 4.**
