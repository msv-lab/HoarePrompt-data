The line `current_cost = 0` sets the value of `current_cost` to 0. This affects only the `current_cost` variable, while other variables like `t`, `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1**
