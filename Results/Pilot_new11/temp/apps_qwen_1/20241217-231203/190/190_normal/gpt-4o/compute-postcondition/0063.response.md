Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length less than 2 or greater than or equal to 2 (adjusted to 4 if necessary), `current_cost` is either 1 or 2 if the length of `a` is less than 2, otherwise `current_cost` is `n - 4`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` remains 2.***
