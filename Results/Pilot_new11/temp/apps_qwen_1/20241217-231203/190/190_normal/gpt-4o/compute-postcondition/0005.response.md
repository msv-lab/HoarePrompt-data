The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `current_cost` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1, `current_cost` is 0**
