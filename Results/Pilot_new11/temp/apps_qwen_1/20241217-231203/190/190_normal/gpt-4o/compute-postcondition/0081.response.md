The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\).

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but based on typical problem statements, it might return a value derived from processing the list `a`. However, since no specific return value is mentioned, we will consider the function's behavior based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and a list `a` of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\).**
