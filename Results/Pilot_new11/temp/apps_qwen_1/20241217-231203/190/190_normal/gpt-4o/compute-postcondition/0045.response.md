The current cost is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to `current_cost`. Given the initial state, `t` is 2 and `length` is the second element in the list `a`, which means `length` is `a[1]`. Since `t` is 2, the expression `t - 1 - length` simplifies to `2 - 1 - a[1]`, which further simplifies to `1 - a[1]`.

Therefore, `current_cost` is updated to be its original value plus `1 - a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 2, `current_cost` is its original value plus `1 - a[1]`, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, `length` is `a[1]`.**
