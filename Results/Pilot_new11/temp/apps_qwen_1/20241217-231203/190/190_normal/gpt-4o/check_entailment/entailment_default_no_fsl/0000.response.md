Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100 and calculates the cost of making all stick lengths almost good for \( t \). The cost calculation matches the given definition: if a stick length is less than \( t - 1 \), the cost is increased by \( t - 1 - a_i \), and if it is greater than \( t + 1 \), the cost is increased by \( a_i - (t + 1) \). The code then selects the value of \( t \) that minimizes the total cost and prints this value along with the minimum cost. Since the code handles all potential cases within the specified constraints and adheres to the problem description, it is correct.
