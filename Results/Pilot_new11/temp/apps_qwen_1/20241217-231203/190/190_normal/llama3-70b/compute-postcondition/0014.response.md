Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`.
   - `min_cost` and `min_t` are initialized or updated based on the condition `if cost < min_cost`.

2. **Loop Characteristics:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `mid - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `i_prev`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to decrease by 1.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev`.
- For the loop to continue, `i` should now be `i_prev - 1`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `min_cost` and `min_t` might have been updated if `cost` was less than `min_cost` during the previous iteration.
   - `cost` is recalculated for the new `i` value, but its exact value is not specified.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is `i_prev - 1`.
- `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their previous values unless they were updated in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (i_prev - 1)), abs(x - i_prev))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` must be equal to the previous `min_cost`, and `min_t` must be equal to the previous `min_t`.**

However, to simplify and provide a clear answer:
State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (i_prev - 1)), abs(x - i_prev))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` is unchanged, and `min_t` is unchanged.**

This reflects that `i` is decremented by 1, while `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their previous values unless updated in the current iteration.
