You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the optimal value of \( t \) and the minimum cost to make all stick lengths almost good for \( t \). Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Sorting and Initial Midpoint Calculation**: The program sorts the stick lengths and uses the median as an initial guess for \( t \). This helps to minimize the total cost since the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

2. **Optimal \( t \) Search**: The program searches for the optimal \( t \) by considering both lower and higher values around the initial median, checking each possible \( t \) from \( mid-1 \) to 0 and from \( mid+1 \) to 100. It calculates the cost for each and keeps track of the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \).

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each candidate \( t \), the program computes the cost using the formula \( \text{cost} = \sum_{x \in \text{sticks}} \min(|x - t|, |x - (t + 1)|) \). This ensures that the cost reflects the minimum necessary changes to make the sticks almost good for \( t \).

Given these steps, the program handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the given loop, let's break down the loop logic and the changes it makes to the variables involved.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `mid` is an integer.
    #- `cost` is initially undefined.
    #- `min_cost` is initially undefined.
    #- `min_t` is initially undefined.
    #- `sticks` is a list of integers.
    #
    #### Loop Logic
    #The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to `100` (inclusive).
    #
    #For each iteration:
    #- `cost` is calculated as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i-1`.
    #- If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, and `min_t` is set to the current value of `i`.
    #
    #### Analysis of Iterations
    #Let's analyze the loop based on the provided output states for the first few iterations:
    #
    ##### After 1 iteration
    #- `i` is `mid + 1`.
    #- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
    #- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 1`.
    #- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.
    #
    ##### After 2 iterations
    #- `i` is `mid + 2`.
    #- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
    #- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 2`.
    #- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.
    #
    ##### After 3 iterations
    #- `i` is `mid + 3`.
    #- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
    #- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 3`.
    #- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.
    #
    #From these patterns, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `100`, or until `min_cost` cannot be further improved by any subsequent iteration.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #- The loop will eventually execute for all `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`.
    #- `min_cost` will hold the minimum value of `cost` encountered during the loop.
    #- `min_t` will hold the value of `i` corresponding to the minimum `cost`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #**Output State: `i` is `100`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `cost` encountered during the loop, and `min_t` is the value of `i` corresponding to `min_cost`.**
    #
    #Note: If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `mid + 1` is greater than or equal to `100`), then `min_cost` and `min_t` will remain their initial undefined states.
    print(min_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on input from the user. It processes a list of integers `sticks` and determines the integer `t` that minimizes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and either `t` or `t+1`. The function sorts the list `sticks` and initializes `t` and `min_cost` with the median of `sticks`. It then iterates from `mid - 1` down to `1` and from `mid + 1` up to `100`, updating `min_cost` and `min_t` if a lower cost is found. After the loops, the function prints the value of `min_t` and `min_cost`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input list `sticks` has fewer than 2 elements, the function will raise an error because the median calculation (`mid = sticks[n // 2]`) will be invalid.
- If the input list `sticks` is empty, the function will also raise an error due to the same reason as above.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `sticks` contains duplicate values. The median calculation and subsequent operations assume unique values in `sticks`.
