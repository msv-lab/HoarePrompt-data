The code calculates the cost using the formula `sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)`. Given the initial state, `i` is `mid + 1`, and `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101, the value of `i` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). However, the value of `i` itself is not specified, only its relationship to `mid`. Additionally, `sticks` is a list of integers, and their values are not specified. Since the exact values of `sticks` are not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `cost`. 

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101, and `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.**
