Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `mid + 1`
- `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101
- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`
- If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 1`

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to 100 (inclusive).

### End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `mid + 1`
- The loop condition `i < 101` was true, so `i` must be incremented to `mid + 2`.

### Updated States:
- `i` must now be `mid + 2`
- Since `i` is incremented, the new value of `i` is `mid + 2`.
- The conditions for `mid` remain the same as `mid` does not change within the loop.
- `cost` and `min_cost` are only updated if `cost` is less than `min_cost` for the current `i`. Since we don't know if this condition was met, we keep `cost` and `min_cost` unchanged unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

### New State:
State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 2` is less than 101, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, and `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far or the initial value.**

Since `i` is now `mid + 2`, the loop will continue to check the next value of `i` until it reaches 101.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 2` is less than 101, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, and `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far or the initial value.**
