You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only considers changing the sticks to the nearest values around the median without considering the possibility of choosing a different \( t \) that could potentially result in a lower cost.

Let's consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
3
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 0
```

Explanation: All sticks are already almost good for \( t = 1 \), so no changes are needed, and the cost should be 0.

However, the program outputs:
```
1 1
```

This is incorrect because the program calculates the cost based on the median value, which in this case is 1. It computes the cost as follows:
- Changing 1 to 1 has a cost of 0.
- Changing 1 to 1 has a cost of 0.
- Changing 2 to 1 has a cost of 1.

Thus, the total cost is 1, which is higher than the expected cost of 0.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on input from the user. It processes a list of integers `sticks` and determines the integer `t` that minimizes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and either `t` or `t+1`. The function sorts the list `sticks` and initializes `t` and `min_cost` with the median of `sticks`. It then iterates from `mid - 1` down to `1` and from `mid + 1` up to `100`, updating `min_cost` and `min_t` if a lower cost is found. After the loops, the function prints the value of `min_t` and `min_cost`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input list `sticks` has fewer than 2 elements, the function will raise an error because the median calculation (`mid = sticks[n // 2]`) will be invalid.
- If the input list `sticks` is empty, the function will also raise an error due to the same reason as above.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `sticks` contains duplicate values. The median calculation and subsequent operations assume unique values in `sticks`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
