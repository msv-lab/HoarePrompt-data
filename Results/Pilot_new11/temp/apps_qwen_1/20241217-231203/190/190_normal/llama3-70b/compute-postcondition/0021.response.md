The code sets `min_cost` to the value of `cost`. This means `min_cost` will now hold the same value as `cost`. The values of `min_t` and the calculation of `cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `min_t`.**
