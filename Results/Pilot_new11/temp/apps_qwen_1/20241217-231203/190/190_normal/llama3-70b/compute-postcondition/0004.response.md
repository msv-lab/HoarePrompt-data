The code calculates the cost as the sum of the absolute differences between each element in the list `sticks` and the median element `mid`. The value of `cost` is computed but none of the other variables (`n`, `sticks`, or `mid`) are changed. Therefore, the only updated variable is `cost`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100
- `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`

After executing the code, `cost` is assigned the value of the sum of `abs(x - mid)` for each `x` in `sticks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`.**
