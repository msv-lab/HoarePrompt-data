The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, with the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b. The function returns `True` if `a // x + b // x >= n`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept an integer `x`, and return `True` if the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition is not met, it returns `False`.
