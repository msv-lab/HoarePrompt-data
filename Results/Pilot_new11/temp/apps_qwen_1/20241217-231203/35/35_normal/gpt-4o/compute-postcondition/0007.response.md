Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns True, then `low` is 2 and `high` is 2. Otherwise, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1. `mid` remains 1.***
