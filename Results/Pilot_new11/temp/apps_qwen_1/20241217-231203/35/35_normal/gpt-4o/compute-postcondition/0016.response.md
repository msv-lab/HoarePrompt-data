The code `high = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. The value of `low` remains unchanged from its previous state. The value of `mid` is defined as `low + high` divided by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is not its original value or if `low` is its original value, `high` must be greater than `low`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `high` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`low` is not its original value or if `low` is its original value, `high` must be greater than `low`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `high` is equal to `mid`**
