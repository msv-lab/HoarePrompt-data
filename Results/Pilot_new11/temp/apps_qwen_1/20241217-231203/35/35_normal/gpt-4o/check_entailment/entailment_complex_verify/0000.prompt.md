You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the maximum possible number \(x\) such that each plate will contain at least \(x\) pieces of cake. However, there are edge cases that the current implementation does not handle correctly.

Consider the following input:
```
n = 4
a = 2
b = 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate. In this case, the total number of pieces is \(a + b = 2 + 3 = 5\). With 4 plates, the minimum number of pieces per plate should be at least \(\lceil \frac{5}{4} \rceil = 2\).

However, the `can_distribute` function checks if \(a // x + b // x \geq n\). For \(x = 2\):
- \(a // 2 = 1\)
- \(b // 2 = 1\)
- \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than \(n = 4\)

This means that \(x = 2\) cannot be distributed. However, since \(x = 1\) satisfies the condition (\(a // 1 + b // 1 = 2 + 3 = 5 \geq 4\)), the program should return \(x = 1\).

But the binary search implementation in `func_1` returns \(x = 0\) because the loop does not correctly handle the boundary conditions. Specifically, when `mid` is 1, the `can_distribute` function returns true, but the loop does not update `low` correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this and other similar cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, and both are the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. `mid` is equal to `low` and `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1 where low is equal to high and both are the smallest values for which can_distribute(mid) returns True, and mid is equal to low and high
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). It performs a binary search to find the smallest value `x` for which the function `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. After the loop, `low` equals `high` and both represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. The function returns `low - 1`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `low - 1`, where `low` and `high` are equal and represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. If no such value exists, `low - 1` will be 0.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n`, `a`, and `b` are such that `can_distribute(mid)` never returns `True`, the function will still execute the loop but will eventually set `low` to `min(a, b) + 1`. In this case, `low - 1` will be 0.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `can_distribute(mid)` is defined and works correctly within the given constraints. If `can_distribute(mid)` is not implemented or does not work as expected, the function behavior could be incorrect.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`a // x + b // x >= n` where `x` is an unspecified variable, `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Here, `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, with the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b. The function does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, or `n`; it only evaluates the given condition. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 or when `x` is greater than `a + b`, which would always result in `False` since `a // 1 + b // 1 = a + b` and `a + b` cannot be greater than or equal to `n` if `n > a + b`. The function does not handle negative values for `a`, `b`, or `n`, nor does it check if `x` is a non-integer or zero.
