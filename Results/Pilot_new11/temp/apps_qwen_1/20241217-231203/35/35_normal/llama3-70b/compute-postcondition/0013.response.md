Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer such that \(a < 4x_start - 2 - b\), `b` is an integer such that \(b < 4x_start - 2 - a\), and `x` is `x - 1`. If `a >= x` and `b >= x` and \((a - x + (b - x) >= x)\), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x`.***
