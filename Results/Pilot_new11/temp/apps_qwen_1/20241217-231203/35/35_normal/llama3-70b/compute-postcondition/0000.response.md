The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Given the initial state where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the integers entered by the user, and these values will replace the initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input**.
