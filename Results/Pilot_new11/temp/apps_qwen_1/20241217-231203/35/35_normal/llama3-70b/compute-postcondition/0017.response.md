The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but seems to imply that it should operate within certain constraints involving three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b). However, since the function definition itself does not list any parameters, we need to infer from the provided constraints.

Given the constraints, the function likely needs to validate the inputs indirectly through some mechanism, but as defined, it doesn't explicitly accept any parameters.

Since the function does not have any parameters listed in its definition, we will focus on the implied inputs and their constraints:

Functionality: **The function operates within the constraints that n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, and returns a value based on these constraints.**
