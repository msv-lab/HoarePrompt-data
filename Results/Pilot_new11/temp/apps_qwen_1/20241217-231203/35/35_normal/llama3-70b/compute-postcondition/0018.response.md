Functionality: **The function reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \). It then finds the largest integer \( x \) such that \( a \geq x \), \( b \geq x \), and \( a - x + (b - x) \geq x \). The function prints this integer \( x \) as the output. The function handles edge cases where \( a \) or \( b \) might be equal to 1, and ensures that \( n \) is always valid within the given constraints. If no such \( x \) exists, the function will decrement \( x \) until it finds a valid solution or reaches 1.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If \( a = 1 \) or \( b = 1 \), the only possible \( x \) would be 1, because \( a \) or \( b \) cannot be less than \( x \).
- If no valid \( x \) can be found during the loop, the function will eventually set \( x \) to 1, which is the smallest possible value.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where \( a \) or \( b \) is exactly 1, though it implicitly does so by setting \( x \) to 1 in those scenarios. However, it should clearly document this behavior.
