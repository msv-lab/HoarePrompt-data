Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either `[ (0, i - 1) ]` where `i` is the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index 0, `start` is 0, and `trophies[i + 1]` is not 'G', or an empty list `[]`, `i` is 3, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `start` is its original value, `m` is the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index 0, `i` is `2 + m`, and `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1). Otherwise, `i` is 3 and `segments` remains unchanged.**
