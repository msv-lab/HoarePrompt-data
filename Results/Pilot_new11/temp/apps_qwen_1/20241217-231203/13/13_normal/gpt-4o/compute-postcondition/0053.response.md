Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's found in `trophies`; `i` is 1; `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; and `len(segments) > 1`; `prev_start` is the start of the first segment in `segments`; `prev_end` is the end of the first segment in `segments`; `curr_start` is the start of the second segment in `segments`; `curr_end` is the end of the second segment in `segments`. The current value of `curr_start` is 2 more than the current value of `prev_end`**.
