Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either `[ (0, i - 1) ]` where `i` is the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index 0, `start` is 0, `i` is 4, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `trophies[i]` is 'S'**
