Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either `[ (0, i - 1), (4, i - 1) ]` or `[ (0, i - 1) ]` where `i` is the last index where `trophies[i]` is 'G', `start` is either 4 or 0, depending on whether `trophies[i]` is 'G' or 'S', and `i` is the last index where `trophies[i]` is 'G'.**
