Output State: **`left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found, `right` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` from the start to the end.
- `curr_beauty` keeps track of the current number of consecutive 'G's.
- When a 'G' is encountered, `curr_beauty` is incremented.
- When a 'S' is encountered, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `curr_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` is reset to 0.
- The `while` loop inside the `else` block moves the `left` pointer to the next 'G' after the current 'S', ensuring that the next segment starts at a 'G'.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed the entire string `s`. At this point:
- `left` will be the index of the last 'G' in `s` (or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found).
- `right` will be the length of `s`.
- `max_beauty` will be the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop.
- `curr_beauty` will be 0 since the loop has finished and there are no more characters to process.

The `golden` list remains unchanged throughout the loop and contains the indices of all 'G's in the string `s`.
