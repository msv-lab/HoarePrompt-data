Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is at least 5, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started, and `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `j` up to `i-2` inclusive, or 1 if no such sequence exists, and `s[j] != 'G'`**
