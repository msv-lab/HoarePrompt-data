The code updates `max_beauty` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since `curr_beauty` is either 1 or remains unchanged (and given that `n` is greater than 0, it implies `curr_beauty` is 1 because if it were 0, it wouldn't change the max_beauty since `max_beauty` starts at 0), `max_beauty` will be updated to 1 if `curr_beauty` is 1, or remain unchanged if `curr_beauty` is 0.

Therefore, the updated value of `max_beauty` depends on the initial value of `curr_beauty`. Given the conditions, `max_beauty` will be 1 if `curr_beauty` is 1, and otherwise, it will stay as the maximum of 0 and the current value of `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `right` is 2**
