The code `print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))` does not change any variable values. It simply prints the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. Since the values of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` are not modified by this code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in `s` after swapping at most one 'S' with 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in `s` without any swaps, `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found, `right` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.**
