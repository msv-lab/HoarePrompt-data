`left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is 4, so the new value of `left` is 5. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 5, `right` must be greater than or equal to 4, `s` must be a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0.
