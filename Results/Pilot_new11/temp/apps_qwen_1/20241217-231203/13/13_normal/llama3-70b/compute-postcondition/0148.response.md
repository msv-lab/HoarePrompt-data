To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`.
- `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 2` to `n - 1` (inclusive).

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`.
- `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute again, `j` must be set to `i + 2` (which is 6), and the loop will iterate until it reaches `n - 1`.

### Adjusted States:
1. **`i`**: Remains 4.
2. **`j`**: Should be set to `i + 2`, which is 6.
3. **`s`**: Remains unchanged.
4. **`golden`**: Remains unchanged.
5. **`max_beauty_one_swap`**: Remains unchanged.
6. **`beauty`**: The value of `beauty` from the previous iteration will be used unless a new maximum is found during this loop iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to 6.

State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, and `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.**
