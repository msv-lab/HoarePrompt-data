`left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 1, so the new value of `left` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 2, `s[1]` is not 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0.
