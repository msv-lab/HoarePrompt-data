Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to `right`, `s[left-1]` is 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'. If `left < right`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and 1, and `curr_beauty` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` remain unchanged.***
