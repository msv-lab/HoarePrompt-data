The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Initially, `beauty` is either 3 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 2 (if `s[0]` is not 'G'). After incrementing by 1, `beauty` will be 4 (if `s[0]` was 'G') or 3 (if `s[0]` was not 'G'). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, `beauty` is 4 (if `s[0]` was 'G') or 3 (if `s[0]` was not 'G')**
