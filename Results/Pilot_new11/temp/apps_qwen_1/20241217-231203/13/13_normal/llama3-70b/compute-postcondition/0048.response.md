Output State: **'left' is equal to the length of 's', 'right' is 2, 's' is a string where 's[0]' is 'S', 's[1]' is not 'G', and 's[2]' is 'G', 'max_beauty' is the maximum of its current value and 0, 'curr_beauty' is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `left` until it either reaches the end of the string (`left` equals the length of `s`) or `s[left]` is 'G'.
- Given the initial conditions and the fact that the loop continues to execute, `left` will eventually reach the length of `s` because `s[2]` is 'G' and the loop will stop once `s[left]` becomes 'G'.
- Since `s[2]` is the last character and it is 'G', `left` will become the length of the string `s` (i.e., `len(s)`).
- `right` remains 2 throughout the loop as no operations change its value.
- The string `s` does not change during the loop, so `s[0]` remains 'S', `s[1]` remains not 'G', and `s[2]` remains 'G'.
- Both `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` remain unchanged at their initial values of the maximum of its current value and 0, which is 0.
