The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since `curr_beauty` is not mentioned in the initial state and there is no predefined value for it, we can assume it starts at 0 (a common default value for such operations). After executing this line, `curr_beauty` will be 1.

The states of the other variables (`left`, `right`, and `s`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is 1**
