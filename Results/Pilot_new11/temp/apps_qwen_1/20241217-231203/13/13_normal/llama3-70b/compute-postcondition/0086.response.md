The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions specified for the variables are also preserved.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` must be in the range (5, n), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1), and `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise `beauty` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
