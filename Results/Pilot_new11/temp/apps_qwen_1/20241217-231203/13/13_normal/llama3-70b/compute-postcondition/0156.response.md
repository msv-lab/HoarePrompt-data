Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- \( i \) is 4.
- \( j \) is the index of the last 'G' in \( s \) that is at least 2 positions after 4.
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- \( golden \) contains all indices of 'G' in \( s \).
- \( max\_beauty\_one\_swap \) is the maximum of its current value and the final value of \( beauty \).
- \( beauty \) is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from \( j \) up to but not including \( i \).

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration (j = 6):**
   - If \( s[6] \) is 'G', then \( beauty \) is incremented by 1.
   - If \( s[6] \) is not 'G', the loop breaks.

2. **Second Iteration (j = 7):**
   - If \( s[7] \) is 'G', then \( beauty \) is incremented by 1.
   - If \( s[7] \) is not 'G', the loop breaks.

3. **Third Iteration (j = 8):**
   - If \( s[8] \) is 'G', then \( beauty \) is incremented by 1.
   - If \( s[8] \) is not 'G', the loop breaks.

4. **General Case:**
   - The loop continues to increment \( beauty \) until it encounters an 'S' or reaches the end of the string.

5. **Final State of the Loop:**
   - The loop will terminate when \( s[j] \) is not 'G' or \( j \) reaches the end of the string.
   - Therefore, \( j \) will be the largest index such that \( s[j] = 'G' \) and \( j \geq i + 2 \).
   - \( beauty \) will be the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from \( j \) up to but not including \( i \).

### Final Output State:

- \( i \) remains 4 because the loop does not change \( i \).
- \( j \) is the largest index such that \( s[j] = 'G' \) and \( j \geq i + 2 \).
- \( s \) remains the same string of length \( n \) consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- \( golden \) remains the same, containing all indices of 'G' in \( s \).
- \( max\_beauty\_one\_swap \) is the maximum of its current value and the final value of \( beauty \).
- \( beauty \) is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from \( j \) up to but not including \( i \), where \( j \) is the largest index such that \( s[j] = 'G' \) and \( j \geq i + 2 \).

### Output State:
**Output State: `i` is 4, `j` is the largest index such that `s[j]` is 'G' and `j` is at least `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, and `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.**
