The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block directly associated with the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the state of any variables. The `break` statement itself indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside, but no such block exists here.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`, and `beauty` is 1, `s[j]` is not 'G'**
