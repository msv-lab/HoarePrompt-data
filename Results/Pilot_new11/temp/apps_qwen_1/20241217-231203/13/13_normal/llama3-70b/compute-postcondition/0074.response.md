Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `curr_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in `s`.
- `beauty` is the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in `s`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is within the valid range (0 to n-1).
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.
- `beauty` reflects the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks.

### For Loop:
The for loop iterates over the range from `i + 2` to `n`:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Given: `i` is 2.
   - The loop will start from `i + 2`, which is `4`.

2. **Range of `j`:**
   - `j` must be in the range from `4` to `n-1` for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one valid `j` in this range.

3. **String `s`:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - Since `i` is 2, `j` will start from 4, so we need to ensure that the substring `s[4:n]` contains at least one 'G'.

4. **List `golden`:**
   - `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'.
   - We need to ensure that there is at least one 'G' in the substring `s[4:n]`, meaning there must be at least one index in `golden` that is in the range `[4, n-1)`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `curr_beauty`, `beauty`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` do not directly affect the loop condition but may be updated inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that there is at least one valid `j` in the range `[4, n-1)`, meaning there must be at least one 'G' in the substring `s[4:n]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is within the valid range (4 to n-1), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', and `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1)**.
