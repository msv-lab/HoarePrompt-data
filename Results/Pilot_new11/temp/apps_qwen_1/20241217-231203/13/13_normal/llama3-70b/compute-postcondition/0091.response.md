According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `j` will be recalculated as the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`**.
