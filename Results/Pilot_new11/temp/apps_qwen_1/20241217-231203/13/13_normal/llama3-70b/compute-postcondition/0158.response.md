Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `j` is the largest index such that `s[j]` is 'G' and `j` is at least `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and `beauty`, and `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is incremented by 1; otherwise, no changes occur.**
