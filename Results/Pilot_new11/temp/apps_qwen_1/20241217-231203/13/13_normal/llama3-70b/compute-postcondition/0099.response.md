Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`
   - `beauty` is either 2 (if `s[j]` is 'G') or 1 (if `s[j]` is not 'G')

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)` iterates from `i - 1` down to 0.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be decremented until it reaches -1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 0 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` will be 0.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `s`.
   - `s` remains unchanged as the string does not change within the loop.
   - `golden` remains unchanged as the set of indices does not change.
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged as the calculation of `max_beauty` does not depend on `j`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged as it is initially equal to `max_beauty` and does not change within the loop.
   - `beauty` will be updated based on the value of `s[j]` (which is now `s[0]`).

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `j` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`
- `beauty` is either 2 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 1 (if `s[0]` is not 'G')

**State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`, `beauty` is either 2 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 1 (if `s[0]` is not 'G')**.
