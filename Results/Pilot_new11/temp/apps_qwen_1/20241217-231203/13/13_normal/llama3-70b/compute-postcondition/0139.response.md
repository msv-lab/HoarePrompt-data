The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, or `s`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 0, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`**
