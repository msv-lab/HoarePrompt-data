The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, it will exit the context it was inside, which could be an implied loop or if-else statement.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
