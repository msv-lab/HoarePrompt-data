Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
   - `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop
   - `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0
   - `beauty` is 4 if `s[j]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 3 if `s[j]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', 2 if `s[j]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G'.
   - If `s[j]` is not 'G', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):` starts from `j = i - 1` and decrements `j` until `j < 0`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be >= 0.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `j` would be `j - 1`.
   - Since `j` was 1, the next value of `j` would be 0.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `total` remains 10.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `j` is now 0.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `golden` remains unchanged.
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged.
   - `curr_beauty` will be updated based on the value of `s[0]`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0.
   - `beauty` will be updated based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is 4 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 3 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', 2 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G'.**
