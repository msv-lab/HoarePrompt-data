The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the loop or the innermost if-else statement the program was in, but since no such context is provided in the initial state, we assume it exits without changing any variables.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
