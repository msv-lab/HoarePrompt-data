Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', representing golden and silver trophies respectively. It calculates and prints the maximum number of consecutive golden trophies ('G') either without any swaps or with at most one swap of a silver trophy ('S') to a golden trophy ('G'). The function handles all potential edge cases, such as strings containing no golden trophies or no suitable positions for swapping.**
