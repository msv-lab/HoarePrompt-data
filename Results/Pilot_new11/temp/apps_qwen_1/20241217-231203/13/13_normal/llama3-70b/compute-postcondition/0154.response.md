The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that `break` is directly inside, it does not affect any of the variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 7, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, and `beauty` is either incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', or remains unchanged as the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.**
