Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of actions `l` and the skewers to be turned over is flawed.

To see why, consider the following example:

### Example:
- Input:
  ```
  5 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  1 6
  ```

In this example, the program outputs `6`, which is out of bounds since the maximum index is `5`. Additionally, turning skewers `1` and `6` is incorrect because skewer `6` does not exist.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Actions (`l`)**:
   - The formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` does not correctly determine the minimum number of actions required. This formula assumes a uniform distribution of actions, which is not always accurate.

2. **Incorrect Selection of Skewers**:
   - The program incorrectly selects skewers based on the calculated indices, leading to out-of-bound errors and incorrect skewers being turned.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the problem correctly in at least one case, hence the correctness is `False`.
