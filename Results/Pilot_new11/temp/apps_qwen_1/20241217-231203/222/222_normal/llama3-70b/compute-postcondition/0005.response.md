According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop will continue as long as `i < l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- `n > k + 2`
- `res` is a list containing the value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `l`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

We do not have information about `l` from the previous iteration, but we need to ensure that `i + 1 < l` for the loop to continue.

Given the information, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\), and `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing the value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
