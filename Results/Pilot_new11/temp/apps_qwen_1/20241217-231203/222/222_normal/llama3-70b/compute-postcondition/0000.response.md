`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the `input()` function, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The original constraints are maintained, so `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000**
