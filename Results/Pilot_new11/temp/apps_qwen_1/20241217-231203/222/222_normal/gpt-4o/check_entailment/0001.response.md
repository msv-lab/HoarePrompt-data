Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for certain cases. Specifically, it does not account for the requirement to minimize the number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Instead, it simply appends every $(2k+1)$-th skewer to the list, which does not necessarily result in the minimum number of actions.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, turning skewer 3 would affect skewers 2, 3, and 4. The optimal solution here is to turn skewers 2 and 5, which results in all skewers being turned over in just 2 actions. However, the provided program would incorrectly suggest turning skewers 1 and 4, which requires 2 actions but is not the optimal solution.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of actions needed to turn over all skewers, making it incorrect for some cases.
