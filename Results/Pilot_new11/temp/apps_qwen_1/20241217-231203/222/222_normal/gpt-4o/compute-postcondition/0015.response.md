Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). After executing the function, it prints the length of the `positions` list, which contains all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 1000. Additionally, it prints the elements of the `positions` list separated by spaces.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the `positions` list will only contain the initial value 1. The function will then print 1 and the string "1".
- If `n` is 1, the loop runs only once, appending 1 to the `positions` list. The function will then print 1 and the string "1".
- If `n` is 1000 and `k` is non-zero, the loop will run 500 times (since \(i = 1 + 2k + 1 = 3 + 2k + 1 = 4 + 2k + 1 = \ldots\)), and the `positions` list will contain all odd numbers from 1 to 999.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function should return either `n` or `None` based on the value of `k`. However, the actual implementation does not return anything. Therefore, the function should be modified to include a return statement to match the described behavior. For example:
  ```python
  return len(positions) if k != 0 else n
  ```

After the function concludes, the `positions` list will be printed, and the program will terminate without returning any value unless the suggested modification is implemented.
