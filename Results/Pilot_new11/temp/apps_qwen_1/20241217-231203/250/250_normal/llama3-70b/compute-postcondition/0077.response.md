`additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `i` is an index less than `n`, and `j` is an unspecified variable, the value of `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element, now containing `i + j`.**
