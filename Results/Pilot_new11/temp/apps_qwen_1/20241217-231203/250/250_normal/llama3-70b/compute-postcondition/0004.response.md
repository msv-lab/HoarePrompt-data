To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

Given states before the loop:
- `n` is between 2 and \(10^5\)
- `l` is between 2 and \(10^9\)
- `x` is less than `y` and both are between 1 and `l`
- `marks` is a set of integers from the input
- `x` is less than `y`
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers
- `need_x` is `False`
- `need_y` is `False`

For loop statement:
```
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The for loop `for j in range(i, n):` implies that `i` is the starting index and `n` is the upper limit of the range.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
3. Since `n` is already defined and within the specified range (2 to \(10^5\)), we don't need to adjust `n`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Specifically, `i` should be a value such that `i < n` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is between 2 and \(10^5\), `l` is between 2 and \(10^9\), `x` is less than `y` and both are between 1 and `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `x` is less than `y`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**

However, to explicitly state what needs to be adjusted:
State: **`i` is less than `n`**
