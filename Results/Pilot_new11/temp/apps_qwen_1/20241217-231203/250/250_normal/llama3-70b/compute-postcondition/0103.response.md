Output State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list minus the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks` minus the current `i` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks` and checks if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`.
- If the condition is satisfied, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `additional_marks` will contain all elements `i + j` that satisfy the conditions and were not previously in `additional_marks`.

Since the loop does not modify `i`, `n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `marks`, and `additional_marks` directly other than appending to `additional_marks`, these variables retain their properties and values as described in the initial state. Specifically, `additional_marks` will be the union of all valid `i + j` values found during the iterations, ensuring that no duplicates exist and all values satisfy the given conditions.
