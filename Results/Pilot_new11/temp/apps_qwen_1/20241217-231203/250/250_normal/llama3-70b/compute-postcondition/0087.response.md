Postcondition: ***`i` is the next element in the `marks` list. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes `i + j`. Otherwise, the condition does not change the state of `additional_marks`. `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains at least one element.***
