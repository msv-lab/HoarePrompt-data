Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an index less than `n`.
   - `marks[j+1] - marks[i]` equals either `x` or `y`.
   - If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` is `True`.
   - If `marks[j] - marks[i]` does not equal `y`, the condition of `need_x` remains as per the precondition, and `need_y` is `True`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new value of `j` and update the other relevant states.

Since the loop starts at `i` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `j` would be `i + 1` (if it hasn't reached `n-1` yet).

4. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains the same since it is the starting point of the loop and doesn't change within the loop.
   - `j` will be `i + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `marks[j+1] - marks[i]` should still be either `x` or `y` based on the initial conditions.
   - If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` is `True`.
   - If `marks[j] - marks[i]` does not equal `y`, then `need_x` remains as per the precondition, and `need_y` is `True`.

Given this, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `marks[j+1] - marks[i]` equals either `x` or `y`, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` is `True`, otherwise `need_x` remains as per the precondition and `need_y` is `True`.**
