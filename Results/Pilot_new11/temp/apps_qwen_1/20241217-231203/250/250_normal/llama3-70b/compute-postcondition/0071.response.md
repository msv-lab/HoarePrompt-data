The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `i + j` is not already in `additional_marks` (as per the precondition), it will now be added to the list.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element and now includes `i + j`, the current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`**
