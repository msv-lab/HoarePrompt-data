Postcondition: ***`i` is an index less than `n`, `need_x` is `False` because there does not exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`; `additional_marks` is an empty list***
