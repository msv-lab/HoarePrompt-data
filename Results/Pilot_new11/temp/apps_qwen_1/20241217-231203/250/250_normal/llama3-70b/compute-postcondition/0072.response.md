Postcondition: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, then `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`.**
