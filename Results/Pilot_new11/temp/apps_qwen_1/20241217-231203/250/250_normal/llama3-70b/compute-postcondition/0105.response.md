The code prints the length of the `additional_marks` list but does not modify any variables. Therefore, the length of `additional_marks` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `marks` is a list that initially contains unique elements and may be modified by appending new elements during the loop, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks`. The length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
