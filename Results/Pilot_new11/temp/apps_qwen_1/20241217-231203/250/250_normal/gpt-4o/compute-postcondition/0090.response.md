Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True` or `False`, and the output is either `0` or `1` depending on the conditions inside the if and else blocks. Specifically, if `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, the output is `0`. Otherwise, `1` is printed to the console, and `new_marks` is either the set of elements derived from the operations involving `x` and `y` with the last element removed, or an empty set, and `x` and `y` are both set to `1`.***
