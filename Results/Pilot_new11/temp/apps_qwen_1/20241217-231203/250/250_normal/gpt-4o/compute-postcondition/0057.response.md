Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is False. If `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` has at least one less element and `y_found` remains False, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least one more element (equal to `mark - x`). If none of these conditions are met, then `marks` has at least one less element and `y_found` remains False.***
