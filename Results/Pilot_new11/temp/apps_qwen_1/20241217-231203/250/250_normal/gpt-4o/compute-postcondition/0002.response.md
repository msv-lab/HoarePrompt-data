The code `marks_set = set(marks)` creates a set from the list `marks`. The set data structure does not allow duplicate elements, which means if there are duplicate elements in `marks`, they will be removed in `marks_set`. The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list.**
