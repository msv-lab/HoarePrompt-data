The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `marks`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as the input for `marks` does not depend on these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks` is a list of integers read from the input**
