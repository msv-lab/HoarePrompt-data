The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the `new_marks` list. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `mark` and `x`. Therefore, the new element added to the list `new_marks` will be `mark + x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`**
