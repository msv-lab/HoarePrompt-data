The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the `new_marks` list. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `mark` and `x`. Additionally, `new_marks` is not initially defined in the given initial state. Given this, we can infer that `new_marks` is being modified, but its exact contents cannot be specified without further context.

The other variables, `marks` and `y_found`, are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a list containing the element `mark + x`.**
