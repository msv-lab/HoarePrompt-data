Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where neither `x` nor `y` can be derived from the existing marks, and it does not guarantee the minimum number of additional marks required.

Consider the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

Expected output:
```
2
185 230
```

However, the program prints:
```
2
230
```

This happens because the program only checks for `mark + x` and `mark - x` and `mark + y` and `mark - y`, but it does not ensure that both `x` and `y` can be measured. In this case, it only finds `230` as a possible mark to add, but it should also consider adding `185`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that both `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks or the newly added ones, and it should guarantee the minimum number of additional marks required.
