`y_found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`marks`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `x_found`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is found in `marks_set`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is found in `marks_set`.**
