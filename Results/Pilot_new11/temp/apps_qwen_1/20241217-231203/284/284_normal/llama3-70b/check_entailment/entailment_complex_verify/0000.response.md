Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. Let's re-examine the program with the annotated version to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `m`**: The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime by:
   - Returning `False` immediately if the number is less than 2.
   - Checking divisibility by integers from 2 to the square root of the number.
4. **Correct Logic**: If `n * m + 1` is not a prime number (as determined by `func_1`), the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program will find and print a valid `m` within the specified range, as guaranteed by the problem statement.

Given these points and the annotations, the program behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
