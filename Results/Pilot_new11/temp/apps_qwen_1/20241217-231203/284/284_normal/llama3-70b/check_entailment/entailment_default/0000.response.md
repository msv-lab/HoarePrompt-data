Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program reads an integer `n` from input, then iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop. The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by verifying if it is less than 2 or divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number. Given the constraints and guarantees, the program will always find a valid `m` within the specified range, thus meeting the problem description for every potential case.
