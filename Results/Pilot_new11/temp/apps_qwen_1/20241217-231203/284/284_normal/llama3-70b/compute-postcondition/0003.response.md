According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` and the range specified in the `range()` function. The loop will execute as long as `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and the upper limit of the range, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
2. **Range Calculation**: The loop runs from `2` to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 2 (since the loop starts from 2).

Let's break it down further:
- Since `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the smallest possible value for `num` is 2.
- When `num = 2`, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1 = int(2 ** 0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. This means the loop will run from 2 to 2, which is valid.
- For larger values of `num`, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will always be greater than 2 because the square root of any number \( \geq 4 \) will yield a result such that when incremented by 1, it remains greater than 2.

Therefore, we only need to ensure that `num` is within the given constraints and that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 2.

State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, and `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 2**
