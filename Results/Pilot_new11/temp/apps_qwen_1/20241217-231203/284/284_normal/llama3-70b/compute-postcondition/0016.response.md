Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` as input, where `1 ≤ num ≤ 1000`. It checks whether `num` is a prime number. The function returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, √num]`. If `num` is not divisible by any integer in this range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `num` is 1, the function returns `False` because 1 is not considered a prime number.
- If `num` is 2, the function returns `True` since 2 is the smallest prime number.
- If `num` is any prime number between 3 and 1000, the function will correctly identify it as prime and return `True`.
- If `num` is any composite number between 3 and 1000, the function will correctly identify it as non-prime and return `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation "The program returns False" is mentioned multiple times, which is redundant and does not add any new information. The function indeed returns `False` in multiple cases but it is more informative to explicitly list these cases.
