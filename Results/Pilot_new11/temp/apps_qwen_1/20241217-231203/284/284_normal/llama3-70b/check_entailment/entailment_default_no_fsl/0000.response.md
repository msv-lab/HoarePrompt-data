Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses the function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. If it finds an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop. The function `func_1` correctly determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the code will work for every potential case. The input \( n \) is within the specified range, and the code ensures that the output \( m \) is also within the required range. Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists for any \( n \), the code will always find and print a suitable \( m \).
