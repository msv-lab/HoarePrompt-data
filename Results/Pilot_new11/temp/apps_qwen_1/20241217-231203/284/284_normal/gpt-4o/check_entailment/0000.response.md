Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. For any given \( n \), the program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly identifies whether a number is prime or not, considering all necessary cases:

- It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
- It returns `True` for numbers 2 and 3.
- It efficiently checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
- It uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form \( 6k \pm 1 \) up to the square root of the number.

Since the program correctly identifies a non-prime number for any \( n \) within the specified range, it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
