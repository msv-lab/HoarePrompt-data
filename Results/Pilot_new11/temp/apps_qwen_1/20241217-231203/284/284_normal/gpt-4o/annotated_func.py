#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 1000 and returns `True` or `False` based on specific conditions. Specifically, it returns `False` if `x` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, or if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3. It returns `True` if `x` is greater than 3, not divisible by 2 or 3, and no prime factors smaller than or equal to the square root of `x` are found up to a certain point (i.e., when `i * i > x`). The function ensures that all integers within the specified range are checked according to these rules. Notably, the function handles edge cases where `x` is less than or equal to 1 or 3 by returning `False` immediately. For numbers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by 2 and 3 first, then uses a loop to check for other potential divisors up to the square root of `x`, stepping in increments of 6 to skip even numbers and multiples of 3. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
