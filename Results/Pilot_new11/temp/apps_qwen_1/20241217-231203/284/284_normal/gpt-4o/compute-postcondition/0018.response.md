The value of `i` is incremented by 6, but the exact initial value of `i` is not specified. However, since `i` was previously an integer such that if `x` (which is an integer greater than or equal to 144) is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`, the current value of `i` does not affect the condition unless it specifically makes `x` divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. Since the increment of `i` by 6 does not inherently make `x` divisible by `i` or `i + 2` (as long as the original condition did not hold), the return value of the function remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 144; i is increased by 6**
