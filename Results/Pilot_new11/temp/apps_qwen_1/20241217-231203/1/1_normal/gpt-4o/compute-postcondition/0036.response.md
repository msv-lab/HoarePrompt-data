To ensure the loop `for i in range(ind + 1, bind):` can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which this loop can run:

1. **Range Definition**: The `range()` function requires that the start value (`ind + 1`) is less than the stop value (`bind`). Therefore, `ind + 1` must be less than `bind`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or `-1` if no such character is found.
   - `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, or `-1` if no such character is found.
   - `i` is initially `-1`.
   - `ind` is either not `-1` and less than `bind`, or both are `-1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- If `ind` is `-1`, then `ind + 1` would also be `-1`, making the range invalid because `-1` is not less than `bind`. Hence, `ind` should not be `-1`.
- If `bind` is `-1`, then the range would be invalid because `-1` cannot be greater than `ind + 1`. Hence, `bind` should not be `-1`.
- Since `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[`, and `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]`, we need `ind` to be less than `bind`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute correctly.

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is `-1`, `ind` is not `-1` and less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `-1**.
