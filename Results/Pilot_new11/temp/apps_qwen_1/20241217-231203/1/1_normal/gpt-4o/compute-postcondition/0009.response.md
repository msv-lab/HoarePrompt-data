The code `ind = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ind`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 before this line of code, the new value of `ind` will be `i + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
