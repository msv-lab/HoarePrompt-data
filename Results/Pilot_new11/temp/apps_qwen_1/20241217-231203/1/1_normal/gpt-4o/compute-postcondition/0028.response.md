`bind` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is -1, `bind` is also set to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is -1, `i` is -1.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is -1, `i` is -1**
