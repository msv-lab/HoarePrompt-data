Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`; `i` is either `0` (if the condition `s[i] == ']'` is true) or continues to be decremented until it reaches `0` (if the condition is false).***
