Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `bind - 1` to `ind` in reverse order (decrementing `i` by 1 each time).
   - This means `i` will take values from `bind - 1` down to `ind`.
   - Therefore, the loop will only execute if there are indices in the range `[bind - 1, ind]`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`.
   - `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`.
   - `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`.
   - `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop.
   - `start_colon` is 1 if a colon (`:`) is found within the range `[ind + 1, bind)` during the loop, otherwise `start_colon` remains -1.
   - `end_colon` is -1.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, the range `[bind - 1, ind]` must contain valid indices.
   - Specifically, `bind - 1` should be greater than or equal to `ind` to ensure there are elements in the range.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` and `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]`, and given that `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`, we need to ensure the range `[bind - 1, ind]` is valid.
   - The initial state should reflect that there are elements in the range `[bind - 1, ind]`.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`.
- The range `[bind - 1, ind]` must contain valid indices.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**`total` is irrelevant here as it was not part of the initial conditions, `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - 1, ind]` must contain valid indices.**

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - 1, ind]` must contain valid indices.**
