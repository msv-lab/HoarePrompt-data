The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since there is no loop or if statement mentioned, it simply means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement context.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is now `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
