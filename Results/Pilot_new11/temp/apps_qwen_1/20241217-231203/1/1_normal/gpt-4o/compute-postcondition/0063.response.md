Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - 2, ind]` must contain valid indices; if `s[i] == ':'`, `end_colon` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `end_colon` is `i - 2` regardless of whether `s[i-2]` equals `':'` or not.***
