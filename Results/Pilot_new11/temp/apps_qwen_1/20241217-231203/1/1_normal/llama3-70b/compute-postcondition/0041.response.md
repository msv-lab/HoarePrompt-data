Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is -1, `bind` is equal to `i`, `s[i]` is equal to `':'`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `']'`. If `s[i]` is not `':'`, the original values of `f`, `ind`, `bind`, and `s[i]` are retained.***
