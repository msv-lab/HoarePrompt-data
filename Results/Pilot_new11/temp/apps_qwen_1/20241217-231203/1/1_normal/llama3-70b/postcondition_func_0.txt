The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive. It searches for the first occurrence of `['` and the last occurrence of `']'` that follow it, and if such occurrences are found, it calculates the number of `|` characters in the substring between them (excluding the delimiters). If no valid pair of `['` and `']'` is found, or if the substring between them is empty or starts with `]`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of `|` characters plus 4. The function does not modify the input string `s`.
