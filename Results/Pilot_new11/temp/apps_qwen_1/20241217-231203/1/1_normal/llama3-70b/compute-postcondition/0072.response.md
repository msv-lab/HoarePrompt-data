Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `ind` is an integer such that `ind <= bind`.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is `ind + 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `ind + 1` to `bind`.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `s[i]` is `|`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We don't have explicit information about `ans` from the given example. However, we can assume it starts as 0 unless stated otherwise.
   - The important states to consider are `ind`, `bind`, `s`, and `i`.

5. **Determine Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `bind`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `ind + 3` (since `i` was `ind + 2` at the start of the previous iteration).

6. **Updated States:**
   - `ind` remains the same.
   - `bind` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `ind + 3`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be updated is `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`ind` is an integer such that `ind <= bind`, `s` is a string, `i` is `ind + 3`**.
