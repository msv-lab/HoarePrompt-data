Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `f` is `True`.
   - `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`.
   - If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `bind` is `-1`, otherwise `bind` is equal to `i` and `s[i]` is `':'`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order (`range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1 from its value in the current iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range defined by `n-1` to `0`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is being decremented in each iteration, `i` will be one less than it was in the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, we assume `n` does not change.
   - `f` remains `True` unless modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, we assume `f` does not change.
   - `ind` and `bind` depend on the value of `s[i]`. Specifically, if `s[i]` is `']'`, `bind` is set to `-1`; otherwise, `bind` is set to `i` and `s[i]` is `':'`.

5. **Final State Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is being decremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `n-1` to `0`, the new value of `i` will be `n - 2` (assuming the previous `i` was `n - 1`).
   - Therefore, `ind` and `bind` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is -1. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `bind` is -1, otherwise `bind` is equal to `i` and `s[i]` is `':'`, where `i` is now `n - 2`.**
