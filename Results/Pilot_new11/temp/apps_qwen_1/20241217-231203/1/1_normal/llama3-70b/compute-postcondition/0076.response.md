The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` but will not change its value. The values of `ind`, `bind`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the last index `i` where `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is `True`, `ans` is `4` plus the number of `|` characters in the substring `s[ind+1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.**
