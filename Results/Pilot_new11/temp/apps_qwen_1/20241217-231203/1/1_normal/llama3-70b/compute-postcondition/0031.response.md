`f` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first ':' character that occurs after the first '[' character if such a '[' exists, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1.
