Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `bind` is -1, otherwise `bind` is equal to `i` and `s[i]` is `':'`, where `i` is now `n - 2`. After executing the if-else block, `bind` is `-1` if `s[i]` is `']'`, otherwise `bind` is either `n - 2` (if we break out of the loop or match-case) or remains as `i` (if no break occurs and `s[i]` is `':'`). `ind` remains unchanged unless `s[i]` is `']'` and `ind` was initially -1.***
