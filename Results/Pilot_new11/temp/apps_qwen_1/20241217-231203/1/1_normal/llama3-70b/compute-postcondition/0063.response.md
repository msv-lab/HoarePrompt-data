Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`. If `s[i]` is `']'` for any `i`, then `bind` is `-1`; otherwise, `bind` is the last index `i` where `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is `True`. `ind` is greater than `bind`. `ind` is not `-1` and `bind` is not `-1`**
