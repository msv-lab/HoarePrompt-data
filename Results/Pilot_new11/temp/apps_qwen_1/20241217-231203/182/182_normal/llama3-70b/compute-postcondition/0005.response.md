The code snippet calculates the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` and prints the result. Let's break down the steps:

1. The value of `x` is first adjusted by adding 90 and subtracting 1, resulting in `x + 89`.
2. The result of `x + 89` is then divided by 90 using floor division (`//`), which gives the quotient without the remainder.
3. The result of the floor division is taken modulo 4.

Since `x` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ x < 360 and `x` is not equal to 0, let's consider the possible values for the expression:

- If `x` is in the range -359 to -1 (excluding 0), the value of `x + 89` ranges from -270 to -1. Dividing by 90 gives -3 (since -270 // 90 = -3). Taking -3 % 4 gives 1.
- If `x` is in the range 1 to 359 (excluding 0), the value of `x + 89` ranges from 90 to 447. Dividing by 90 gives 1 to 4 (depending on the exact value). Taking these quotients modulo 4 gives 1, 2, 3, or 0.

Therefore, the value printed will be one of 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the specific value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ x < 360, and `x` is not equal to 0; print value is 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the value of `x`.**
