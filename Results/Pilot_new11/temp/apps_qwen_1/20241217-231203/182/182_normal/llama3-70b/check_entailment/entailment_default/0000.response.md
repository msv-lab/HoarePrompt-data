Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical. Instead, it normalizes the input angle `x` to the range of -359 to 359 degrees and then applies a modulo operation to determine the number of 90-degree clockwise turns. However, this approach does not consider the direction of rotation (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) and thus does not always yield the correct result.

For example, consider the following cases:
- For an input of `60` degrees (clockwise), the code calculates `(60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which results in `3`. However, the correct number of turns should be `1` because `60` degrees clockwise is equivalent to `300` degrees counter-clockwise, and one 90-degree clockwise turn would align the image with the vertical direction.
- For an input of `-60` degrees (counter-clockwise), the code calculates `(-60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which results in `2`. However, the correct number of turns should be `3` because `-60` degrees counter-clockwise is equivalent to `300` degrees clockwise, and three 90-degree clockwise turns would align the image with the vertical direction.

These examples demonstrate that the code does not accurately compute the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical for every potential case.
