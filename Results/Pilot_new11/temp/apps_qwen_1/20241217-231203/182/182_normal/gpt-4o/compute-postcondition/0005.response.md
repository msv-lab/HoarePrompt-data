Functionality: **The function reads an integer `x` from the user, normalizes `x` to an angle between 0 and 360 degrees by taking `x % 360`, calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to reach an angle of 0 from the normalized angle, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It handles the case where `x` is an integer within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\). The function also correctly accounts for negative values of `x` by normalizing them to the appropriate positive equivalent within the 0 to 360 degree range.**

Edge Cases:
- If `x` is exactly 0, the function will print `0` since no turns are needed.
- If `x` is a multiple of 360, the function will also print `0` since it is already aligned with the 0-degree mark.
- If `x` is a negative number, it will be correctly normalized to a positive equivalent within the 0 to 360 degree range before calculating the number of turns. For example, `-90` will be normalized to `270` and the function will print `3`.
