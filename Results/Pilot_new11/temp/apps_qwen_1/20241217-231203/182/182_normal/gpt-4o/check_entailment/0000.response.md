Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative input angles. The program normalizes the angle to within the range of 0 to 360 degrees using `x % 360`. It then calculates the required number of turns by determining how much to rotate the image to get the smallest possible deviation from vertical. The logic `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` ensures that the minimum number of turns is found, considering the constraints of rotating only 90 degrees at a time. This approach works for all potential cases as it handles both positive and negative angles appropriately.
