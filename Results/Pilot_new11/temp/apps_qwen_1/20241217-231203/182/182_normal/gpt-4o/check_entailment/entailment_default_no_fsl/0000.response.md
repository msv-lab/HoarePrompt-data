Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when the input angle is a multiple of 360 degrees. For example, if the input is \(360\) degrees (or any multiple of 360), the code will normalize it to 0 degrees and then calculate the number of 90-degree turns needed to reach 0 degrees from 0 degrees, which is 0. However, according to the problem description, the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to achieve minimal deviation from vertical should still be 0 in this case.

To fix this, the code should consider the input angle modulo 360 and then determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align the image closest to vertical. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    min_turns = min((360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4, (normalized_angle + 360) // 90 % 4)
    print(min_turns)
```

This version correctly handles all cases, including multiples of 360 degrees, by considering both the original angle and its supplementary angle (i.e., \(360 - \text{angle}\)).
