Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles both positive and negative angles by normalizing the angle to a range between 0 and 360 degrees using `x % 360`. Then, it calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical using the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This formula ensures that the number of turns is minimized while adhering to the constraint of rotating only 90 degrees at a time. The annotations support the correctness of the program, as they describe the state of the program accurately and confirm that the logic works for all valid inputs within the specified range.
