`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 3, `prev_pos` is 2**
