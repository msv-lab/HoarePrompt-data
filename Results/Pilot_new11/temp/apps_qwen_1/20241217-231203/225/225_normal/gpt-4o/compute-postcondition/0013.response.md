Initial values are:
- `i` is 2
- `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0)
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
- `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1
- `prev_pos` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1

The code snippet updates `max_jump` by setting it to the maximum between its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`.

Let's analyze the different cases:

1. If `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`:
   - `max_jump` is initially 2
   - `prev_pos` is 2
   - `max_jump` is updated to `max(2, 2 - 2) = max(2, 0) = 2`

2. If `s[2]` is not in the set `vowels`:
   - `max_jump` is initially 1
   - `prev_pos` is -1
   - `max_jump` is updated to `max(1, 2 - (-1)) = max(1, 3) = 3`

In both cases, `i` remains unchanged, and `prev_pos` remains unchanged. Therefore, the final values are:
- `i` is 2
- `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0)
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
- `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 3
- `prev_pos` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1

Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 3, `prev_pos` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1**
