Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value of `i - last_vowel` // 2 + 1 encountered during the loop (with `i - last_vowel` being even), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string, `i` is `n`. If no vowels are found in the string, `last_vowel` remains -1.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates through each character of the string `s`. For each character, it checks if the character is a vowel.
- **Initialization**:
  - `max_jump` starts at 0.
  - `last_vowel` starts at -1.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - If `s[i]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` was not set yet (`last_vowel == -1`), `max_jump` is updated to `i + 1`.
  - If `s[i]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` was previously set, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
  - `last_vowel` is updated to `i` if `s[i]` is a vowel.
- **Final State**:
  - After all iterations, `max_jump` will contain the largest value of `i - last_vowel` // 2 + 1 for consecutive vowels, where `i - last_vowel` is even.
  - `last_vowel` will be the index of the last vowel found in the string, or -1 if no vowels were found.
  - `i` will be `n` (the length of the string `s`).
  - The value of `vowels` and `n` (length of `s`) remain unchanged as they are constants or derived from the initial state.
