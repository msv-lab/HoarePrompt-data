Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string by jumping only on vowels. The issue lies in the calculation of `max_jump`. The code currently calculates the maximum jump distance between consecutive vowels, which does not necessarily represent the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

For example, consider the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". According to the problem description, the correct output should be 4 because the Grasshopper needs to jump from 'C' to 'F', which is a distance of 4 characters. However, the current implementation would calculate the maximum jump distance between consecutive vowels and return 3, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the code should calculate the maximum distance from the last vowel to the end of the string and ensure that the Grasshopper can jump from the start to the first vowel and then cover the remaining distance. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    
    # Find the index of the last vowel
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            last_vowel = i
    
    # Calculate the distance from the start to the first vowel
    if last_vowel > 0:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, last_vowel)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string
    if last_vowel < n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel - 1)
    
    print(max_jump)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the Grasshopper can jump from the start to the first vowel and then cover the remaining distance to the end of the string.
