The code `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_jump` is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `last_vowel`.
- `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1, and if `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is set to 1; otherwise, `max_jump` is set to 2.

Since `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is now set to 1. This changes the value of `last_vowel`, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is either 1 or 2, `last_vowel` is 1.**
