The code `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel. This means `last_vowel` is now set to 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel**
