The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `last_vowel`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `vowels`, `n`, or `max_jump`. Therefore, the only change is that `last_vowel` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is 0; `last_vowel` is -1**
