Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Determining Minimum Coins Each Friend Can Gift**:
   - The condition `if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :` checks if there are enough friends to provide different coins and if there are enough coins to make sure at least `L` are new. However, it does not correctly ensure that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is calculated.
   - The logic should ensure that the total number of new coins (`L`) can be distributed among the friends such that each friend gives at least one unique coin. This means that the minimum number of coins each friend can gift is `max(1, (L + M - 1) // M)`, ensuring that `L` new coins are included.

2. **Output for Valid Cases**:
   - For the first example (`20 15 2 3`), the current implementation outputs `1`, which is correct. However, it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the conditions.
   - For the second example (`10 11 2 4`), the current implementation also outputs `-1`, which is correct, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The program should check if `M * (N - K + 1) >= L` to ensure that the total number of different coins is sufficient to include `L` new ones.
   - If this condition is satisfied, the minimum number of coins each friend can gift is calculated as `max(1, (L + M - 1) // M)`.

To fix the program, it should be updated as follows:

```python
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M * (N - K + 1) >= L):
        min_coins_per_friend = max(1, (L + M - 1) // M)
        print(min_coins_per_friend)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy all the conditions.
