Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the necessary inputs, calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure at least \(L\) new coins are received, and handles the condition check appropriately. The output hints confirm that the program calculates the minimum integer value \(x\) such that \(M \times x \leq N - K\) and prints \(x\) if the condition is met, otherwise \(-1\). The program does not require additional handling for invalid inputs as per the given constraints, and it correctly processes all valid inputs according to the problem description.
