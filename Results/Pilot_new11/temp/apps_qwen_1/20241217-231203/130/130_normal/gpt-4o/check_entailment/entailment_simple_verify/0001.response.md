Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement. 

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and splits them into integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\). This part is correctly annotated as the initial state where these variables are integers with the given constraints.

2. **Minimum Coins Calculation**: The calculation for `min_x` is done correctly:
   \[
   \text{min\_x} = \left\lceil \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rceil
   \]
   This ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the condition that at least \(L\) coins must be new.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition check `if M * min_x <= N - K:` ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted can be accommodated within the available \(N\) types of coins, after accounting for the \(K\) coins Ivan already has. This is correctly annotated as ensuring the total number of unique coins gifted is within the limit.

4. **Output Handling**: If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift (`min_x`). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\). This is correctly annotated as printing the result based on the condition check.

Given these points and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
