Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to consider the requirement that "Not less than \(L\) coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection." 

Let's analyze the issue with the given code:

1. The calculation `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` determines the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure at least \(L\) coins are new. However, this calculation alone does not guarantee that the total number of new coins will be at least \(L\).

2. The condition `if M * min_x <= N - K:` checks if the total number of coins gifted can be distributed such that no more than \(N - K\) types of coins are gifted. This condition does not directly ensure that the number of new coins is at least \(L\).

To fix this, we need to ensure that the number of new coins is at least \(L\). The correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift such that the total number of new coins is at least \(L\). This can be done by calculating `min_x = max((L - K + M - 1) // M, 1)` and then checking if `M * min_x <= N`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = max((L - K + M - 1) // M, 1)
    if M * min_x <= N:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is calculated to meet the requirement of having at least \(L\) new coins in Ivan's collection.
