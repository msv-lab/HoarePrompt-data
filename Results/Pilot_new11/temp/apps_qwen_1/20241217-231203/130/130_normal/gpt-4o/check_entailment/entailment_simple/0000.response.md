Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads four integers \( N \), \( M \), \( K \), and \( L \) from standard input. These values represent the total number of different coins, the number of friends, the current number of coins Ivan has, and the required number of new coins, respectively. The input parsing is done using `sys.stdin.read()` and `map(int, input().split())`, which correctly converts the input into the required integer types.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins Each Friend Must Gift**: 
   - The variable `min_x` is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`. This formula ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is at least `ceil((L + M - 1) / M)`.
   - This calculation aims to ensure that the total number of new coins given to Ivan is at least \( L \).

3. **Condition Check and Output**:
   - The condition `if (M * min_x <= N - K)` checks whether the total number of coins gifted (i.e., \( M \times \text{min\_x} \)) is sufficient to make up for the missing coins in Ivan's collection while also ensuring that the new coins required (\( L \)) are met.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`, indicating the minimum number of coins each friend should gift.
   - If the condition fails, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to meet all the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem description specifies that the input values are within certain bounds: \( 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 10^{18} \) and \( 1 \leq M, L \leq 10^{18} \). The program handles these constraints appropriately.
   - The program also ensures that \( M \times (N - K) \geq L \) holds true, as stated in the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and checks all necessary conditions as described in the problem statement, it meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
