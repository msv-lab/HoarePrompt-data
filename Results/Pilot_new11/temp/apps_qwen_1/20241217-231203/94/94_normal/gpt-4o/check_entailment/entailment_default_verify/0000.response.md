Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect. While `func_2` attempts to find all reachable states from a given initial configuration, it does not actually compare the reachable states of both puzzles to determine if they can be in the same configuration. The function only explores reachable states from a single puzzle and does not account for the possibility of matching states between the two puzzles. Therefore, even though `func_2` correctly implements a breadth-first search to explore reachable states, it fails to address the core requirement of the problem, which is to check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.
