To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `directions`, which is a list of tuples `[(dr, dc)]`. This means the loop will execute once for each direction in `directions`.

2. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `empty_row` is calculated as `empty_pos // 2`.
   - `empty_col` is calculated as `empty_pos % 2`.
   - `empty_pos` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle.
   - `queue` is a deque containing the elements after removing the leftmost element.
   - `visited` is a set containing `start`.
   - `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
   - `current` is the leftmost element of `queue` before removal.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - The loop will execute for each tuple `(dr, dc)` in `directions`.
   - Each tuple represents a possible move in the 2x2 sliding puzzle (up, down, left, right).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `directions` contains at least one tuple.
   - The value of `dr` and `dc` in each tuple must be valid for the puzzle context, but since the problem does not specify invalid moves, we assume all provided directions are valid.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `directions` is explicitly provided and assumed to be valid, no adjustments are needed regarding `directions` itself.
   - However, the initial state should reflect that `queue` has at least one element to ensure there is something to remove, and thus, `queue` should not be empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `queue` is not empty and that `directions` is non-empty (though this is already guaranteed by the problem setup).

**State:**
- **`queue` must not be empty**, ensuring there is an element to process.
- **`directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]` and contains valid moves for the puzzle.**

Final Answer:
State: **`queue` must not be empty, directions is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and contains valid moves for the puzzle.**
