Postcondition: ***`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, the program continues execution with `new_state_str` added to `visited` and `queue`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, the program does not add it to `visited` or `queue` again.***
