The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. Since `new_state` is a list of characters, this operation will concatenate them into a string. This does not affect any other variables, so the values of `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `directions` remain unchanged. The only change is that `new_state_str` is now a string representation of the `new_state` list.

Given the initial state:
- `directions` contains at least one element.
- `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current`, but it has been modified by the swap.

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `new_state_str` is a string that represents the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list.**
