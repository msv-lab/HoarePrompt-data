The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the string representation of `new_state` to the `queue`. This does not change the values of the other variables but adds the new state to the queue. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` contains at least one more element (the string representation of `new_state`); `queue` now contains the string representation of `new_state` in addition to its previous contents.**
