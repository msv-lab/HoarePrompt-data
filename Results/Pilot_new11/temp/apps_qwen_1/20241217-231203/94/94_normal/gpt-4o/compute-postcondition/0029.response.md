To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
   - The conditions `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` must be checked.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop continues if both conditions (`0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`) are satisfied.
   - If the conditions are not met, the program does nothing, and the loop terminates without executing the loop body.

3. **Variables After Conditions**:
   - If the conditions are met, the loop adds `new_state_str` to `visited` and `queue` if it is not already present.
   - If the conditions are not met, the program does nothing.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - If the conditions are met, `new_row` and `new_col` remain as they are after the increment.
   - If the conditions are not met, the loop terminates without changing `new_row` and `new_col`.

### Conclusion:

If the conditions `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are met, the loop continues, and the values of `new_row` and `new_col` remain unchanged from their values after the increment in the previous iteration.

If the conditions are not met, the loop does not continue, and `new_row` and `new_col` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Given that the problem does not specify whether the conditions were met or not in the previous iteration, we assume the general case where the conditions are met, as this is the condition for continuing the loop.

### Final State:

State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and both `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` must be true**.

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `new_row` and `new_col` remain the same as they were after the increment in the previous iteration, assuming the conditions are met.
