The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates the value of `new_pos` based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Given that `new_row` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive), `new_pos` will be calculated accordingly. 

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is `0 * 2 + 0 = 0`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is `0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos` is `0 * 2 + 2 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is `1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos` is `1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is `2 * 2 + 0 = 4`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos` is `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are within the specified range, `new_pos` will take on one of the values 0 through 6.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
