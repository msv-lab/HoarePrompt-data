Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
   - The conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are met.
   - Therefore, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
   - `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped.
   - `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list.
   - Either `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, or the state remains unchanged if `new_state_str` is already in `visited`.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over `directions`.
   - For each direction `(dr, dc)`, it checks if the conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are met.
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operations described above.

3. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are met, we move to the next direction in `directions`.
   - The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are updated based on the current direction `(dr, dc)`.

Given the above, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are as follows:

- `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr` for the next direction.
- `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc` for the next direction.
- The conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are checked again for the next direction.

Since the loop is iterating over all directions and the conditions are met for the current direction, the next direction will be considered. 

**Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` for the next direction.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc` for the next direction.
- The conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` will be checked for the next direction.

State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr` for the next direction, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc` for the next direction, and the conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are checked for the next direction.**
