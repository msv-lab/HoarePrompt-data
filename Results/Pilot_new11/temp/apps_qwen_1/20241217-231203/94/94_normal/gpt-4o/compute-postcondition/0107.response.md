The code swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`. They do not change.
- `new_pos` is derived from `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`. It does not change.
- `new_state` is initially a list containing the same elements as `current`. After the swap, the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are swapped.

Given the initial state:
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`
- `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current`

After the code runs:
- The elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are swapped.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
