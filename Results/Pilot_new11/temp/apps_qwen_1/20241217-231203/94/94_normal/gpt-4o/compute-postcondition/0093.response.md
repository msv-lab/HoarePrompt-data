To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure.

### Given Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `directions` is a non-empty list.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- If `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` holds true, then:
  - `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
  - `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.
  - `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`.
  - If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`. For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more direction in `directions` to process.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `directions` is a non-empty list.
   - `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on `dr` and `dc`.
   - The condition `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` was checked, but it did not necessarily hold true for the current iteration (since we are looking at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop needs to continue, `directions` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, the next `dr` and `dc` values will be used to calculate `new_row` and `new_col`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - The state `directions` should be updated to remove the already processed direction (if applicable), ensuring there are still elements left in the list.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration, `directions` must still be a non-empty list, meaning it must contain at least one more direction. All other variables (`new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, and `queue`) are not directly modified by the loop and will remain as they are until further processing in the loop body.

**State:**
**`directions` is a non-empty list (containing at least one more direction)**, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
