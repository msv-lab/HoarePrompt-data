To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initialization and dependencies of the loop variables and the conditions under which the loop would start.

1. **Initialization and Dependencies**:
   - The loop iterates over each pair `(dr, dc)` from the `directions` list.
   - For the loop to start, `directions` must be a non-empty list as stated in the initial state.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - Each iteration of the loop uses a new `(dr, dc)` pair from the `directions` list.
   - We need to ensure that there are at least one or more pairs in `directions` to allow the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, let's identify the states that need to be adjusted:

- `directions` must be a non-empty list for the loop to start.
- `dr` and `dc` are derived from `directions`, so they will exist as soon as `directions` is non-empty.

Since `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `current`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, `queue`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are derived from other variables and are not directly checked for the loop's initiation, they do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is the non-emptiness of the `directions` list.

**Final State**:
State: **`directions` must be a non-empty list**
