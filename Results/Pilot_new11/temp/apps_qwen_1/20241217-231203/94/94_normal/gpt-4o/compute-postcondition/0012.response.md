The code swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The initial state is that `queue` is not empty, `directions` is a list containing `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `new_state` is a list equal to `current`.

After the code executes:
- The value at `empty_pos` in `new_state` is swapped with the value at `new_pos` in `new_state`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
