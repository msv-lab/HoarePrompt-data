The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins all the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string, with each element separated by an empty string (which is the default behavior of `''.join()`). This operation does not change the contents of the `new_state` list itself, only how they are represented.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the new string representation of `new_state`.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`**
