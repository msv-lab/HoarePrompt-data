Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is the final state obtained by performing all valid moves in `directions` starting from the original `current` state, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing the string representations of all unique states encountered during the execution of the loop, `queue` is a list containing the string representations of all states generated during the loop execution that are not yet in `visited`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate through the `directions` list, attempting to generate new states by moving the empty position within the 2x2 grid.
- Each iteration updates the `current` state by swapping the empty position with each possible neighboring position, provided the new position is within the grid bounds.
- If the new state has not been visited before, it is added to both the `visited` set and the `queue` list.
- The process continues until there are no more valid moves in the `directions` list.
- After all iterations, the `current` state will be the final state reached by the loop, considering all possible valid moves.
