The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the `queue` list. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated queue with `new_state_str` added.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list, `new_state_str` is in `visited`, and `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.**
