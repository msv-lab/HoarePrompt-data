The code assigns the values of `empty_row + dr` to `new_row` and `empty_col + dc` to `new_col`. Given the initial conditions, `new_row` and `new_col` are already defined as `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc` respectively, and both are within the bounds `[0, 2)`. After executing the code, the values of `new_row` and `new_col` remain unchanged from their initial definitions.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
