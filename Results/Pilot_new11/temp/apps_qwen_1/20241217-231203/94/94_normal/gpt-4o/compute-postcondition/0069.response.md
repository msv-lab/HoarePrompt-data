The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list that is a copy of the `current` list. This operation does not modify the existing variables like `directions`, `new_pos`, `new_row`, and `new_col`. The output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current`**
