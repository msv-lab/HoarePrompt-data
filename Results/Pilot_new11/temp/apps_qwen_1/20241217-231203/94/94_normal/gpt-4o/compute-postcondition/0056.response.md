To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and logic within the for loop:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `(dr, dc)` pair in the `directions` list.
2. **State Initialization**: At the start of each iteration, `new_row` is set to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is set to `empty_col + dc`.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` is checked.
   - If this condition is true, several actions are performed:
     - `new_pos` is calculated based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`.
     - `new_state` is created by swapping the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `current` state.
     - `new_state_str` is generated as a string representation of the `new_state` list.
     - If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, the `queue` remains unchanged.
     - If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, the `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`.
   - If the condition is false, no changes are made to `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `queue`, or `visited`.

Given the information at the end of the previous iteration:
- `directions` contains at least one element.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- If `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` holds true, then `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `queue` remains unchanged. If `new_state_str` is in `visited`, `queue` now contains `new_state_str`. If the condition `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` does not hold, no changes occur in `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `queue`, `visited`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `(dr, dc)` pair must be processed. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current value of the iterator `i` in the `directions` list.

Since the `directions` list contains at least one element, the next `(dr, dc)` pair will be the first unprocessed pair. This means `i` will increment to point to the next pair in the list.

**Adjusted States:**
- `directions` still contains at least one element (the next pair).
- `new_row` will be `empty_row + dr` where `(dr, dc)` is the next pair in `directions`.
- `new_col` will be `empty_col + dc` where `(dr, dc)` is the next pair in `directions`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` where `(dr, dc)` is the next pair in `directions`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc` where `(dr, dc)` is the next pair in `directions`**.
