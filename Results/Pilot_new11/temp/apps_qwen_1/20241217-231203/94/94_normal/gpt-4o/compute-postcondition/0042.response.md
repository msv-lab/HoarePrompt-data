The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` searches for the index of the substring 'X' within the string `current`. The variable `empty_pos` is assigned this index. The value of `current` is the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`, but since the exact value of `current` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `empty_pos`. However, we know that `empty_pos` will be the index of 'X' in `current`.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty except for its leftmost element which is no longer in the queue; `current` is equal to the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
