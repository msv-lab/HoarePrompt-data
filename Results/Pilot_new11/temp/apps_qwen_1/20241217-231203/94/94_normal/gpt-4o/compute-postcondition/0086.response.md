The code swaps the values at `new_pos` and `empty_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's break down the steps:

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` refers to the value at the position `empty_pos` in `new_state`.
2. `new_state[new_pos]` refers to the value at the position `new_pos` in `new_state`.
3. The values at these two positions are swapped.

Therefore, the value originally at `new_state[empty_pos]` is moved to `new_state[new_pos]`, and the value originally at `new_state[new_pos]` is moved to `new_state[empty_pos]`.

Since `new_pos` is defined as `new_row * 2 + new_col` and `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, we can substitute these into the equation for `new_pos`:

- `new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

- `empty_pos` remains unchanged.

So, the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped in `new_state`.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.**
