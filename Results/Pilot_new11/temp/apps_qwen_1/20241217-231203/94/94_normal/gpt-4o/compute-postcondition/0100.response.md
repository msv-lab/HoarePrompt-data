The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The value of `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list, which is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list, `visited` is a set containing `new_state_str`, `queue` contains `new_state_str`**.
