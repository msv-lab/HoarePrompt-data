puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively. Each string consists of four characters: 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents the empty cell. Both puzzles have exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
