You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of four characters each, where the characters are either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', representing a 2x2 grid configuration for Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles respectively. Each string contains exactly one 'X', and the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear exactly once each in their respective strings.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters in any order, otherwise False. The indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged, and the 'X' characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` have been swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters where one character is 'X' and the other three are 'A', 'B', and 'C'. It first identifies the index of the 'X' character in both strings. Then, it swaps the positions of the 'X' character in `puzzle1` with the 'X' character in `puzzle2`. After performing the swap, the function checks if the remaining characters in both strings (`puzzle1` and `puzzle2`) are the same in any order. If they are the same, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
