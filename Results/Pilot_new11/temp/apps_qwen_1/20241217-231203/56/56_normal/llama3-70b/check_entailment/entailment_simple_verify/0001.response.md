Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code reveals that the program does not handle cases where the required sequence includes negative elements. Specifically, for the input `1 2`, the program incorrectly outputs `No` instead of `Yes -1 -1`. The logic in the program only appends non-negative bit lengths to the list `a` and does not account for the possibility of including negative exponents in the sequence, which is a requirement based on the problem description. Thus, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements.
