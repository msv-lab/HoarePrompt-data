The code `n -= 2 ** x` subtracts \(2^x\) from `n`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer between \(1\) and \(10^{18}\).
- `k` is an integer between \(1\) and \(10^5\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `a` is a list containing `[x]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is one less than the bit length of `n` (ranging from 0 to 59).

Since `x` is one less than the bit length of `n`, it means that \(2^x\) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. Subtracting \(2^x\) from `n` will reduce `n` by exactly \(2^x\). 

Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `n - 2^x`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2^x`, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is a list containing `[x]`; `i` is 0; `x` is one less than the bit length of `n` (ranging from 0 to 59)**.
