Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list `[]`, `i` is 0; `x` is one less than the bit length of `n` (ranging from 0 to 59). The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `x`**
