The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but we need to consider the possible cases based on the given output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\), and returns based on the specified cases.**
