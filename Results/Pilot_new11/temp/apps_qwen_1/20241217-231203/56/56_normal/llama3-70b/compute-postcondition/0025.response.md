`a.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `a`. The value of `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n.bit_length()` will be a positive integer, and thus `x` will also be a non-negative integer. The precondition that `x` is less than or equal to `i` will determine if a loop or if statement is broken, but since this operation does not involve `i`, and no explicit loop or if statement is mentioned, we assume the operation proceeds as normal.

Therefore, the list `a` will now contain the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`; `a` is a list containing `x`**
