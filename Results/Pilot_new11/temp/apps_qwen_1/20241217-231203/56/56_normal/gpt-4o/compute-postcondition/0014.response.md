Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 with a step of -1. This means it checks each bit position from 60 down to 0.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `n` is set to 1 using the expression `(n >> i) & 1`.
- If the bit is set to 1, the index `i` is appended to the `bits` list.
- The loop continues until all relevant bits have been checked, i.e., until it reaches 0.

After the loop completes, the `bits` list will contain all the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
