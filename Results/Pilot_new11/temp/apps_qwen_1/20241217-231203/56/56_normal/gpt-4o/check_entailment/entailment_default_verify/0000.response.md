Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle the case where the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than `k`. Specifically, if the number of bits required to represent `n` is less than `k`, the program incorrectly returns "No" without attempting to fill the remaining positions with `-1`. This is evident from the output hints and the given examples. For instance, for the input `1 3`, the correct output should be `Yes -1 -1 0`, but the program returns "No". Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and the output hints.
