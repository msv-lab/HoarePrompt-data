The code snippet appends `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. Given the initial state, `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before the pop operation, which means `smallest` is equal to `bits[-1]`. After popping the last element from `bits`, the new last element before appending is `smallest - 1`.

So, after executing `bits.append(smallest - 1)`, the new last element of `bits` is `smallest - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before popping; `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element being `smallest - 1`; `bits` is updated with the new element `smallest - 1` appended to it.**
