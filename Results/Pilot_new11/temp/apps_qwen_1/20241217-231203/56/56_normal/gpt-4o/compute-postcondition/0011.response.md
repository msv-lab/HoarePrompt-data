Let's analyze the given problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` is a list containing the values of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\). If \((n >> 59) & 1 == 1\), `59` is included in `bits`. Otherwise, `59` is not included in `bits`.

### Loop Analysis
The for loop iterates over `i` from `60` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts at `60` and decreases `i` by `1` each iteration until `i` reaches `-1`.

### End of Previous Iteration
At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new state for the next iteration.

#### Current State:
- The loop has just finished an iteration where `i` was decremented by `1` from its previous value.
- Therefore, the current value of `i` is `i + 1` from the previous state.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1` from the previous state.
- We need to check if the loop condition \(60 \geq i > -1\) still holds true.

### New State
- The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` minus `1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `i - 1` from the previous state, ensuring it remains within the bounds of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the value of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\). If \((n >> 59) & 1 == 1\), `59` is included in `bits`. Otherwise, `59` is not included in `bits`, and `i` is decreased by `1` from its previous value.**

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the value of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\). If \((n >> 59) & 1 == 1\), `59` is included in `bits`. Otherwise, `59` is not included in `bits`, and `i` is decreased by `1` from its previous value.**
