The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Before this code executes, `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input.

Since the actual input values are not provided, we represent the updated values of `x` and `y` in terms of the input:

- `x` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `y` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The conditions `3 <= y < x <= 100,000` must still hold true after the assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**.
