Postcondition: ***`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`. If `area` (which is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`) is not an integer, the print statement 'NO' is executed. If `area` is 0, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". If \(2 * area \leq m_input\) and the previous condition is not met, the output is "1 0". If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.***
