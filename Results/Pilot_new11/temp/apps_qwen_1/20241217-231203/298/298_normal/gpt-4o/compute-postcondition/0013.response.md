The print statement outputs the string "0 1". This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The precondition that the area is not equal to 0 and that 2 times the area is less than or equal to `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`, the area is not equal to 0, 2 * `area` is less than or equal to `n`, and printed output is "0 1"**
