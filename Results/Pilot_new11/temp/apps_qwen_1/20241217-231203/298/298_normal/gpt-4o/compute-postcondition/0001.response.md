The code calculates the `area` as `n * m / k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are divided according to their initial states. The result of this calculation is stored in the variable `area`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`**
