Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in handling cases where the area of the triangle is exactly zero. According to the problem description, if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in zero, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if the area is not an integer and prints "NO" in that case. This means that if \( \frac{nm}{k} = 0 \), the program will incorrectly proceed to print "YES" followed by coordinates, which violates the problem constraints.

To fix this, you should add a check for when the area is zero and handle it appropriately by printing "NO". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 1')
            print(f'0 1')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'1 {2 * area}')
            print(f'1 0')
        else:
            print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
            print(f'0 {m // 2}')

func()
```

With this correction, the program will handle all cases as required by the problem description.
