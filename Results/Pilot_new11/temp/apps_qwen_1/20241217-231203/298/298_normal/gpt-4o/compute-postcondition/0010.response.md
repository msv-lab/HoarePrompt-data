The code snippet prints '0 0', which does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`, and the area is not equal to 0**
