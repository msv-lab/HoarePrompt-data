Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate valid points when the calculated area is not an integer but is close to an integer value that could still form a valid triangle.

For example, consider the input `4 4 7`. According to the problem description, the area of the triangle should be \(\frac{4 \times 4}{7} = \frac{16}{7}\), which is not an integer. However, the program checks if this area is an integer and prints 'NO' immediately if it is not. This is incorrect because \(\frac{16}{7}\) can still form a triangle with a non-integer area.

To handle this case correctly, the program should attempt to find points that approximate the required area even if it is not an integer. For instance, it could check if there are points that create a triangle with an area very close to \(\frac{16}{7}\).

Since the program does not account for non-integer areas that should still yield valid solutions, it is incorrect.
