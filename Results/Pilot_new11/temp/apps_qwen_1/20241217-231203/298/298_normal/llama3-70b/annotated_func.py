#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is such that the variable `a` holds the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This holds true for all positive integer inputs. There are no edge cases where the function behaves differently; the algorithm is robust for all positive integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where b is not zero.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y and x - a // b * y` where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not being zero). It recursively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is zero, it returns the pair `(1, 0)`, which corresponds to the base case where the GCD is `a` and the coefficients `x` and `y` are 1 and 0 respectively. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call with parameters `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function finally returns these coefficients `y` and `x - a // b * y`. This process ensures that the function returns the correct coefficients for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, which are valid for the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and they represent the dimensions n and m respectively, and k is a positive integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_2(a, b)`, and the program returns `x`, `y`, and `x * a + y * b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing dimensions `n` and `m` respectively, and another parameter `k`, though `k` is not used within the function. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain values `x` and `y`. The function then returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function assumes that `a`, `b`, and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges.
