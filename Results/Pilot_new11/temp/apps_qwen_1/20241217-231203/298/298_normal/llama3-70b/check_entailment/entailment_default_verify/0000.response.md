Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are helper functions for computing the GCD, extended GCD, and a linear combination of two numbers, respectively. However, these functions are not used to solve the main problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The output hints indicate that `func_3` computes a linear combination of `a` and `b`, but this is not related to solving the problem at hand. Since the main logic to find the points is missing, the program cannot meet the problem description for any valid input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
