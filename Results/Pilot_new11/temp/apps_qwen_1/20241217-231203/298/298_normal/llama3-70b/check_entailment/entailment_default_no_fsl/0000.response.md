Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` is called with parameters `n` and `m`, but the function does not actually use the third parameter `k` in its computation, which is crucial for determining the area of the triangle. The condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` is checking if the area of the triangle can be formed with the given dimensions, but it does not ensure that the area is exactly `nm/k`.

To fix this, the code should use the value of `k` to ensure that the area of the triangle is exactly `nm/k`. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

1. Calculate the GCD of `n` and `m` using `func_1`.
2. Use the result from `func_2` to find coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
3. Ensure the area of the triangle is exactly `nm/k`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
