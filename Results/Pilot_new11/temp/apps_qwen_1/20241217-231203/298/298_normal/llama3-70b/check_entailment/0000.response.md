Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program consists only of helper functions for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), extended GCD, and a linear combination of two numbers. However, the main logic required to solve the problem is missing. Specifically, the program does not include any code to find the three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) that satisfy the conditions described in the problem statement.

The helper functions are not used to solve the main problem, and there is no implementation of the logic to determine the coordinates of the points or to check if a solution exists. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any input, making it incorrect.
