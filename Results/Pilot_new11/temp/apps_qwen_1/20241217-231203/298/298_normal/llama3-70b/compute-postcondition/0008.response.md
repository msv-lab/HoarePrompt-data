The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD).
