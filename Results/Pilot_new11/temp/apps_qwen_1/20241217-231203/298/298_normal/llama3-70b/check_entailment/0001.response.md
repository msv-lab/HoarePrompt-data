Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not address the main problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to be related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the extended Euclidean algorithm, but they are not used in the context of solving the given problem.

To solve the problem, we need to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the current implementation does not include any logic to achieve this.

For example, consider the input `4 3 3`. According to the problem, the area of the triangle should be 4. One valid solution is to place two points on the boundary of the rectangle and the third point inside such that the area condition is satisfied. However, the provided code does not implement any logic to generate such points.

Since the code does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
