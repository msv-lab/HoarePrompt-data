The initial state is defined as follows: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, and `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`.

The code snippet changes the value of `y` from `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b` to `(n - x * a) // b`. 

- `x` is already updated in the initial state as `x_current + 1`.
- The new value of `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`, which simplifies to `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b` since `x = x_current + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `y` remains the same as before the code execution.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`**
