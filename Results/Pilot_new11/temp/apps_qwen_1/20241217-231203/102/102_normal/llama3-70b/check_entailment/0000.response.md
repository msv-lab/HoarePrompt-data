Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) from 0 to \(\lfloor \frac{n}{a} \rfloor\), and for each value of \(x\), it calculates the corresponding \(y\) (the number of Bars bars) using the equation \(y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b}\). If the calculated \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy the condition \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\), it prints "YES" followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\) and exits. If no such pair \((x, y)\) is found after the loop, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly because:
1. It checks all possible combinations of \(x\) and \(y\) within the given constraints.
2. It uses integer division to ensure that \(y\) is a valid non-negative integer.
3. It exits as soon as a valid combination is found, ensuring efficiency.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all given constraints and examples, it is correct.
