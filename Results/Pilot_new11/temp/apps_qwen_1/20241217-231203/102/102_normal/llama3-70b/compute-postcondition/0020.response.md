The `exit()` function call ends the program execution immediately without further execution of the subsequent lines of code. This means that no further changes are made to any variables, and the output from the print statement 'YES' x, y is not displayed. The states of the variables before the `exit()` function call remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`, and the console does not print 'YES' x, y**
