Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only checks for the existence of non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\), but it does not guarantee that the values of \(x\) and \(y\) found are within the bounds of non-negative integers. The code only iterates up to \(n // a\) for \(x\), which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases where \(y\) could be non-negative.

For example, consider the following input:
- \(n = 15\)
- \(a = 4\)
- \(b = 8\)

The correct solution would be \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\), because \(1 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 8 = 12\), which is less than 15. However, the current implementation would not find this solution because it only iterates up to \(n // a = 3\) for \(x\), and it does not properly check the remaining values of \(y\) that could satisfy the equation.

To fix this, the code should iterate over a broader range for \(x\) and ensure that \(y\) remains non-negative. A more robust approach would be to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the solutions, or to iterate over a wider range for \(x\) and check for valid \(y\):

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    found = False
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            if y >= 0:
                print('YES')
                print(x, y)
                found = True
                break
    
    if not found:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that both \(x\) and \(y\) remain non-negative and checks for the correct conditions to find a valid solution.
