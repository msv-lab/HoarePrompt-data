The function `func()` accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` (all between 1 and 10,000,000). It attempts to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If such a pair is found, the function prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and then exits. If no such pair exists, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only outputs to the console. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than `a` or `b`, or when `n` cannot be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.
