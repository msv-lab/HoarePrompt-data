Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is `n // a`, `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed to the console and the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, no such pair of `x` and `y` is found.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` in the range from `0` to `n // a`. For each value of `x`, it calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`.
- The condition `x * a + y * b == n` checks if the pair `(x, y)` satisfies the equation. If it does, the loop prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, then exits.
- After the loop finishes executing, `x` will be set to `n // a`, and `y` will be `(n - (n // a) * a) // b` if there exists a valid pair `(x, y)` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, no valid pair is found, and the variables retain their final values without any further changes.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `n // a` is 0), then `x` will still be 0, and `y` will be `(n - 0 * a) // b = n // b`. However, since no pair `(x, y)` satisfies the condition, no "YES" will be printed, and the values of `x` and `y` will reflect this.
