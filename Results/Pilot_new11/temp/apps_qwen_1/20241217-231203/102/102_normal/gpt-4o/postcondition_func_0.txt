The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prompts the user to input three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), where \( n \) represents the amount of money Vasya has, \( a \) is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and \( b \) is the cost of one Bars bar. The function then checks if there exist non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( n - x \cdot a = y \cdot b \). If such integers exist, the function prints 'YES' followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \). If no such integers exist, the function prints 'NO'.
