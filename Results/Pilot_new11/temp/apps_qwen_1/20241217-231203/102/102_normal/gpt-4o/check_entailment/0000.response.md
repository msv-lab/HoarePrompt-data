Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if it's possible to buy a certain number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to spend exactly `n` burles. It iterates through possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and calculates the remaining amount after buying `x` bottles. If the remaining amount is divisible by `b` (the cost of one Bars bar), it finds a valid pair `(x, y)` and prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

This approach ensures that the program covers all possible combinations of `x` and `y` within the constraints, making it correct for the given problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail.
