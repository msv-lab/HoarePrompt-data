Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of digits and the base for the first number (`X`), followed by the digits themselves.
   - It then reads the number of digits and the base for the second number (`Y`), followed by the digits themselves.

2. **Base Conversion**:
   - The `func_1` function converts a list of digits (in a given base) to its corresponding integer value.
   - This function correctly handles the conversion by iterating through each digit, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the digit.
   - The function works within the specified range of bases (2 to 40).

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to their respective integer values, the program compares them.
   - It outputs `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the comparison result, which matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all given constraints and examples without issues.
   - It correctly handles the conversion and comparison for various valid inputs, including edge cases like leading zeros, maximum base values, and different lengths of digit lists.

Since the program accurately parses the input, converts the numbers to their respective integer values, and performs the required comparison as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
