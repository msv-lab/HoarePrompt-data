Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values. The `func_1` function correctly computes the decimal value of a number given its digits and base, handling cases where the base is between 2 and 40 inclusive. The program also handles the comparison logic correctly, printing the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison result. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected throughout its execution, supporting the correctness of the original assessment.
