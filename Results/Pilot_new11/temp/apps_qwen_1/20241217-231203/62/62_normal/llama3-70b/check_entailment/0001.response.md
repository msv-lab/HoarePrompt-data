Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. The program reads the number of digits and the base for each number, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values. The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. Since the program handles all the specified cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.
