Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not compare the numbers in their original bases as required by the problem description. Instead, it converts both numbers to base 10 and compares them, which is not the intended behavior. The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function correctly converts a number from its given base to base 10, but this conversion is not necessary for the problem at hand. The problem requires comparing the numbers directly in their original bases, which the current implementation does not do. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
