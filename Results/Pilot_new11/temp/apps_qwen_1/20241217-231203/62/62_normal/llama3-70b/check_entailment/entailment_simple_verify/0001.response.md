Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for each number, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values. The annotations support this by clearly stating the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. The program handles all the specified cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately, hence the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
