Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `decimal_value` is updated to `decimal_value * base + digit`.
   - `digits` must have at least two elements.

2. **Loop Statement**: The for loop iterates over each `digit` in the `digits` list.

3. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
   - There must still be at least one more `digit` in the `digits` list to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that there is at least one more `digit` left in the `digits` list.
   - `decimal_value` remains unchanged because it only gets updated inside the loop body, not before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `decimal_value` is the same as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `digits` must have at least one element remaining.

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit`, `digits` must have at least one element remaining**
