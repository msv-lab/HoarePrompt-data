Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. It then compares these decimal values and outputs the correct symbol ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` correctly converts the number from the given base to decimal and leaves the `digits` list empty upon completion. There are no edge cases or functionalities missing that would render the program incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
