`decimal_value` is updated by multiplying its current value by `base` and then adding `digit`. The previous value of `decimal_value` was from the previous iteration, and `digit` is a value from the current iteration. The new value of `decimal_value` is the old value of `decimal_value` multiplied by `base` plus `digit`.

Output State: **`decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit`, `digits` must have at least two elements**
