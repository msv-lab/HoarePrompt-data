Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It first converts both numbers to their decimal representations using the `func_1` function, which iterates through the digits of each number, multiplying them by the appropriate power of the base and summing them up to get the decimal value. This approach ensures that the program can handle any valid input within the specified constraints.

The main function then compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison result. Since the conversion logic and comparison are implemented correctly and the program handles all the given constraints (number of digits, base ranges, etc.), it works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
