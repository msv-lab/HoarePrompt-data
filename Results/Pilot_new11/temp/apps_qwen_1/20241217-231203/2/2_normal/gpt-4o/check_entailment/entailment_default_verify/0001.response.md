Final: **True**

Reasoning: After reviewing the provided code and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be incorrect. The revised code provided in the problem description now correctly handles the case where the input number itself has the maximum sum of digits. It checks if the candidate number has a higher sum of digits or is equal to the input number if their sums are equal, ensuring the correct output in all scenarios. The function `func_1` also works correctly to compute the sum of digits. Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the program is now correct.
