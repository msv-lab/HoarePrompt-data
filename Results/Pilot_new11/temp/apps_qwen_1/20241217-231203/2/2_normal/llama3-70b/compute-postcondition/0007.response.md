`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is greater than `max_sum`, which means the new value of `max_num` is also greater than `max_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to `i`, `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of `i`, and the current digit sum of `i` is greater than `max_sum`.**
