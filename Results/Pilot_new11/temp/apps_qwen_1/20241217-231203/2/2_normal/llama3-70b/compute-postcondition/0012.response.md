`max_num` is reassigned to the value of `i`. The previous value of `max_num` is now assigned to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to `i`, `max_sum` is equal to the digit sum of `i + 1`, `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to `i`, `max_sum` is equal to the digit sum of `i + 1`, `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`**
