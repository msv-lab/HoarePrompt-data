Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `x` must be at least 1.
   - `max_num` is equal to `i` and `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of `i`, if the current digit sum of `i` is greater than `max_sum`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `max_num` and `max_sum` remain unchanged.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `x`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop has just completed an iteration, meaning `i` was the value it ended on.
   - `max_num` and `max_sum` were updated based on the current value of `i` (if applicable).

4. **Determine the Values for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, x + 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (one more than the value it ended on).
   - `max_num` and `max_sum` will remain unchanged unless the new `i` value updates them.

6. **Construct the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect the updated `i` and the unchanged `max_num` and `max_sum`.

Given these points, we can construct the new state as follows:

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to `i` and `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of `i`, if the current digit sum of `i` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, the values of `max_num` and `max_sum` remain unchanged. `i` is increased by 1.**

To simplify this into a clear answer:

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the previous `i` and `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of the previous `i`, if the current digit sum of the previous `i` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, the values of `max_num` and `max_sum` remain unchanged. `i` is now `i + 1`.**
