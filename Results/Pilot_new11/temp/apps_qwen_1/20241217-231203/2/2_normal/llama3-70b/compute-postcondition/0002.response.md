The code `max_num = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_num`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code. The value of `max_sum` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`x` is the integer value of the input string and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, `max_num` is 0, `max_sum` is 0**
