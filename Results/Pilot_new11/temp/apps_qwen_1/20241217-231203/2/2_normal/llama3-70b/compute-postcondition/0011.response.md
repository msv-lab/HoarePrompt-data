`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`, which replaces the previous value of `max_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the previous `i`, `max_sum` is equal to the digit sum of `i + 1`, `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`.**
