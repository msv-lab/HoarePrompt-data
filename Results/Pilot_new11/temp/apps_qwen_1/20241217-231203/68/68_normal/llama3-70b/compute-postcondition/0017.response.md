Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` > `y` + `z`, the output is '+'. Otherwise, if `x` < `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` == `y` and `z` == 0, the output is '0'. If `x` == `y` and `z` != 0, the output is '?'. In all other cases, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain within the specified range without any specific change, and no output is produced.***
