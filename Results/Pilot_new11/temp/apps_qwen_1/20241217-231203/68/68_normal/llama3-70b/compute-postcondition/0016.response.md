Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Both `x` and `y + z` satisfy the condition `x <= y + z`. If `x < y`, the output of the program is `-`. Otherwise, if `x == y` and `z == 0`, the string '0' is printed. If `x == y` and `z != 0`, a question mark is printed. If `x > y`, no specific action is performed other than maintaining the conditions `0 <= x, y, z <= 100` and `x >= y`.***
