Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the case when the number of unknown votes \(z\) affects the result. Here are the issues:

1. When \(x == y\) and \(z > 0\), the code should print `'?'` because the outcome depends on how the \(z\) unknown votes are distributed. The current code incorrectly prints `'0'`.

2. The code does not cover all cases where the result is uncertain. For example:
   - If \(x == y + z\), the result is uncertain because the \(z\) unknown votes could tip the balance between more upvotes or more downvotes.
   - If \(x + z == y\) or \(x == y + z\), the result is also uncertain for similar reasons.

To fix this, the code needs to handle these cases properly. Here is an updated version of the function that correctly handles all cases:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    elif x + z <= y or x >= y + z:
        print('?')

func()
```

This version correctly handles all cases, including when the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes \(z\).
