The code `print('0')` does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. It simply prints the string '0' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the printed output.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, equal to the current value of `y`, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer and its current value is 0, and the string '0' is printed to the console.**
