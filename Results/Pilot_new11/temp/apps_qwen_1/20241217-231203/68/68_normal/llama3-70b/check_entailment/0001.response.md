Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the number of unknown votes (`z`) is greater than the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes (`x - y`). This can lead to an incorrect determination of the result being uncertain ("?").

Consider the following case:
- Input: `4 2 5`

According to the problem description:
- With `4` upvotes and `2` downvotes, the initial difference is `2`.
- If all `5` unknown votes are downvotes, the total downvotes become `7`, leading to a result of `"-"`.
- If all `5` unknown votes are upvotes, the total upvotes become `9`, leading to a result of `"+"`.

Since there are multiple possible results based on how the unknown votes are cast, the result should be uncertain ("?"). However, the provided program incorrectly prints `+` in this case because it does not account for the scenario where `z > x - y`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
