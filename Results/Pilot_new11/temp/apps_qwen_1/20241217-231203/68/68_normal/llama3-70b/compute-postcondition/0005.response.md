The code prints `-`. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. The precondition that `x` is less than `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer; both `x` and `y + z` satisfy the condition `x <= y + z`; all values are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`; the current value of `x` is less than `y`; the output of the program is `-`**.
