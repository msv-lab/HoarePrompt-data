Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the voting outcome. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior. The program accurately calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes, and based on these calculations, it correctly prints the appropriate result (`+`, `-`, `0`, or `?`). The original assessment is accurate because the program handles all the given cases as specified in the problem statement, and the annotations support this correctness.
