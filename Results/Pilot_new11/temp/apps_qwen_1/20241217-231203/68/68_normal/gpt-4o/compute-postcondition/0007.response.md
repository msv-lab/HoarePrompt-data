Postcondition: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the condition `max_upvotes >= min_downvotes` holds true**
