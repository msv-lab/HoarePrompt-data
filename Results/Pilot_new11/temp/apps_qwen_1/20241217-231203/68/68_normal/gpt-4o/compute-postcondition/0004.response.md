The code sets `max_downvotes` to `y + z`. Given the initial states:

- `x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100)
- `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100)
- `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100)
- `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`
- `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` is `y`

After executing the line `max_downvotes = y + z`, the value of `max_downvotes` is updated to `y + z`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z**.
