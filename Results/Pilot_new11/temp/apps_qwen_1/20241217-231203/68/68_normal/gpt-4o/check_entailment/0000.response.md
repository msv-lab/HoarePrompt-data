Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement. 

- For the case where `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, the program prints `-`.
- For the case where `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, the program prints `+`.
- For all other cases, where the result could be either `+`, `-`, or `0` depending on the votes from the unknown voters, the program prints `?`.

Let's verify this by considering a few test cases:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
   - `min_upvotes = 3`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`
   - `min_downvotes = 7`
   - `max_downvotes = 7`
   - Since `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, the output is `-`.

2. **Case 2**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - `min_upvotes = 2`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`
   - `min_downvotes = 0`
   - `max_downvotes = 1`
   - Since `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, the output is `+`.

3. **Case 3**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - `min_upvotes = 1`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`
   - `min_downvotes = 1`
   - `max_downvotes = 1`
   - Since `min_upvotes == max_upvotes == min_downvotes == max_downvotes`, the output is `0`.

4. **Case 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - `min_upvotes = 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`
   - `min_downvotes = 0`
   - `max_downvotes = 1`
   - Since `max_upvotes > min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes > min_upvotes` is not true, and the exact distribution of votes among the unknown voters can lead to either `+` or `-`, the output is `?`.

5. **Case 5**: `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`
   - `min_upvotes = 2`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`
   - `min_downvotes = 1`
   - `max_downvotes = 2`
   - Here, the result depends on how the additional voter votes, so the output is `?`.

Since the program correctly handles all these cases, the program is correct.
