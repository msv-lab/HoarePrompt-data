The function takes no parameters and reads three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from standard input, where \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. Specifically, `min_upvotes` is set to \(x\), `max_upvotes` is set to \(x + z\), `min_downvotes` is set to \(y\), and `max_downvotes` is set to \(y + z\).

The function checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. If this condition is true, it prints `-`. Otherwise, it further checks if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes. If this second condition is true, it prints `+`. If neither condition is met, it prints `?`.

After the function executes, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, while `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` are updated to reflect the calculations described above. The function prints either `-`, `+`, or `?` to the console based on the conditions evaluated.
