Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from standard input, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `min_upvotes` to \(x\) and `max_upvotes` to \(x + z\).
   - Similarly, it initializes `min_downvotes` to \(y\) and `max_downvotes` to \(y + z\).
   - These initializations are correct because they cover the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes given the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`). If this condition is true, it prints `-`.
   - If the previous condition is false, it further checks if the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) are less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`). If this condition is true, it prints `+`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `?`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The output is handled according to the problem statement. The program prints `+`, `-`, `0`, or `?` based on the calculated conditions, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

5. **Variable State After Execution**:
   - The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after the calculations.
   - The calculated values `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` are updated to reflect the calculations.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all possible cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct and should print the appropriate output for every valid input scenario.
