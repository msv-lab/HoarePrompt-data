The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the integers entered by the user. The initial conditions state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers entered by the user, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
