Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa, and `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. There exists a sofa in `sofas` such that its x-coordinate is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and its y-coordinate is equal to the y-coordinate of `s`. If the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is greater than the x-coordinate of `s` and the same y-coordinate as `s`, then `left` remains 1 and `right` remains 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `left` and `right` values.***
