Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of sofas `d`, the dimensions of the storehouse `n` and `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`.

2. **Counting Neighbors**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of sofas that are to the left (`left`), right (`right`), top (`top`), and bottom (`bottom`) of a given sofa. It iterates through the list of sofas (excluding the current sofa) and checks the conditions based on coordinates.

3. **Comparing Counts**: The main loop compares the counts obtained from `func_1` with the provided counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If they match, it prints the index of the matching sofa and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Handling All Cases**: The code handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the number of sofas that meet the given conditions without any missing logic or edge cases that are not handled.

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all the given examples correctly, the program is correct.
