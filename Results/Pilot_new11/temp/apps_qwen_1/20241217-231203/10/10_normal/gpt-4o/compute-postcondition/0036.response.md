Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `top_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
