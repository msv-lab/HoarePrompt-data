The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of variables outside the loop. Given the initial state and the presence of `continue`, the values of `j`, `d`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `top_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`, `top_count[i]` remains unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
