The code increments `right_count[i]` by 1. Since the condition `i == j` is true and `j` is 1, `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1; `d` is greater than 0; `sofas` is a list of tuples; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`; `top_count[i]` remains unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged; `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 (specifically `right_count[1]`); `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `d` is greater than 0; `sofas` is a list of tuples; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`; `top_count[i]` remains unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged; `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1; `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
