Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `d-1`, and `target_sofa` is `d`. If the conditions `left_count[i] == cnt_l` and `right_count[i] == cnt_r` and `(top_count[i] == cnt_t)` and `(bottom_count[i] == cnt_b)` are met, the program continues with the following operations. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the conditions being met.***
