The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or switch statement context. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is in the range `0` to `d-2`, and `target_sofa` is `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
