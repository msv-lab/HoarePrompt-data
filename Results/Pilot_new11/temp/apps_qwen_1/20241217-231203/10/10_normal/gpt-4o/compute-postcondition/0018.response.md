To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given and the requirements for the loop to run.

1. **Variable `sofas`:**
   - This is a list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2), representing the coordinates of sofas.
   - The loop will iterate over the range of `d`, so `sofas` must contain at least `d` tuples for the loop to execute fully.

2. **Variable `d`:**
   - This is a positive integer within its specified range.
   - For the loop to execute, `d` must be at least 1 because the loop iterates from 0 to `d-1`.

3. **Variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`:**
   - These are values from the input split and converted to integers.
   - They represent counts and do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they should be properly initialized or defined.

4. **Variables `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count`:**
   - These are lists of `d` zeros.
   - They are initialized properly and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

5. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `d`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be able to increment from 0 up to `d-1`.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that the list `sofas` contains at least `d` tuples, and `d` itself is a positive integer greater than 0. The other variables (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count`) are already correctly initialized and do not require adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment

State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `d` tuples, `d` must be greater than 0**
