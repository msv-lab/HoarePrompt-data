`d` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and the lists `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `d` is assigned the value of the integer input stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.**
