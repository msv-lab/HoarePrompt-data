The function processes a set of sofas' coordinates provided by the user and determines if there exists a sofa whose number of left, right, top, and bottom neighbors matches the given counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. If such a sofa is found, it prints the sofa's index (1-based); otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function reads the following inputs: the number of sofas `d`, the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of left, right, top, and bottom neighbors. The function does not return any value explicitly, but its output is printed to the console.
