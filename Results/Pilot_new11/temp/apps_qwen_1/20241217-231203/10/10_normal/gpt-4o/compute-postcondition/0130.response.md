Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, and if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
