Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1 and the state of `right_count[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
