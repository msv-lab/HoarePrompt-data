`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained from the input, which are separated by a space and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. The values of `d`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input separated by a space and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.**
