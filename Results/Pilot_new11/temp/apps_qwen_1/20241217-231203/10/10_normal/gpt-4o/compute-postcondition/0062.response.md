Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is equal to `d`
   - `d` is a positive integer
   - `sofas` is a list of tuples
   - `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`
   - `top_count[i]` is incremented based on the conditions for each `j`
   - `bottom_count[i]` is incremented based on the conditions for each `j`
   - `left_count[i]` is incremented based on the conditions for each `j`
   - `right_count[i]` is incremented based on the conditions for each `j`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - Since `j` is equal to `d`, this means that the current iteration `i` must be `d-1` because the loop has already processed all values from `0` to `d-1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `d`.
   - However, since `j` is currently `d`, and the loop condition checks if `i < d`, the loop will terminate once `i` becomes `d`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` remains `d` (unchanged)
   - `d` remains unchanged (since `d` is a constant positive integer and does not change within the loop)
   - `sofas` remains the same list of tuples
   - `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain the same as they were assigned in the previous iterations
   - `top_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `right_count[i]` are still incremented based on the conditions, but since `i` is now `d`, no further increments will occur.

Given these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`j` is equal to `d`, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[d]`, `top_count[d]` is incremented based on the conditions, `bottom_count[d]` is incremented based on the conditions, `left_count[d]` is incremented based on the conditions, and `right_count[d]` is incremented based on the conditions.**
