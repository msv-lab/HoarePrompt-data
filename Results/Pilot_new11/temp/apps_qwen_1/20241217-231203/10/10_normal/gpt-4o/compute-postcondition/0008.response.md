`sofas` is a list containing a tuple of four input integers. `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers. `d` is a positive integer and is equal to `d - 1`. The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the `sofas` list.

After executing the code, the `sofas` list will contain both the original tuple and the new tuple.

Output State: **`sofas` is [(input integer, input integer, input integer, input integer), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]; `x1` is input integer, `y1` is input integer, `x2` is input integer, `y2` is input integer, `d` is a positive integer and is equal to `d - 1`**
