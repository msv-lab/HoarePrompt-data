Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
