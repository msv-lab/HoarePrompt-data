Postcondition: ***`low` and `high` are integers where `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes > m`, then `high` is updated to (`low` + (`low` + `high`) // 2) - 1. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `low - 1`, `right` is updated to `mid + n`, and `result` is a list created by the range from `low` to `mid + n`.***
