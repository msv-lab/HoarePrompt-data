`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.
Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`**
