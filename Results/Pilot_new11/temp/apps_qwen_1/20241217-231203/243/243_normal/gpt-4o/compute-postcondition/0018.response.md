According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `left_initial - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m` when `left` is decremented by 1 from its current value.

Since `left` is `left_initial - 1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to determine what value `left` must have to satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

Given that `func_1(left)` needs to equal `m` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `func_1(left_initial - 1)` equals `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `left` is set to a value that satisfies this condition for the next iteration.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `left_initial` or the behavior of `func_1`, we can only say that `left` must be set to a value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Given that `left` was `left_initial - 1` in the previous iteration, `left` must be set to a value that maintains this condition.

State: **`left` must be set to a value such that `func_1(left) == m`**
