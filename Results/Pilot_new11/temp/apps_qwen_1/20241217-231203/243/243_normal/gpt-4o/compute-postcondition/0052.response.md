According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. The loop will continue as long as this condition holds true. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `func_1(right) == m` is true.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `func_1(right) == m` is still true at the start of the next iteration. However, since the function `func_1` is not explicitly defined, we can only work with the given information:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `func_1(right + 1) == m`.

Given these points, the loop can execute one more time if `func_1(right) == m` remains true. Since the loop has just executed and the condition was satisfied, we need to ensure that `right` is such that `func_1(right + 1) == m` holds true for the next iteration. This means `right` must be `right + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `right` should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `right` is such that `func_1(right + 1) == m`**
