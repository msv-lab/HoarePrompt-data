The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as (`low` + `high`) // 2, the new value of `low` is `mid + 1`, which is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The other variables (`high`, `mid`, and `zeroes`) are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is (`low` + `high`) // 2 + 1, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
