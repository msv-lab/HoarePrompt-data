To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`
- `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\) and `func_1(right)` must return `m`

The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still return `m` at the beginning of the next iteration.

Let's break down the relevant parts:
- `right` is currently \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\).
- To ensure `func_1(right)` returns `m` in the next iteration, `right` must remain valid and continue to satisfy the condition.

Since `right` is derived from `mid` and the range of values, the only thing that can change to ensure the loop continues is the value of `right`. Therefore, `right` must still be within the range and must continue to return `m`.

No other state needs to be adjusted based on the given information because the loop continuation condition is solely dependent on `right` and the function `func_1`.

Thus, the state remains the same as described.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\) and `func_1(right)` must return `m`**
