Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `m` is very large. Specifically, the binary search approach in `func_2` may not find the correct range of `n` values because the upper bound `high` is set to `5 * (m + 1)`, which might be insufficient for larger values of `m`.

For instance, consider the case where `m = 100`. The actual number of integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly 100 trailing zeroes is more than the range that `high` can cover. This can lead to the program missing some valid `n` values or incorrectly narrowing down the range.

A more robust solution would involve setting a higher upper bound for the binary search or using a different approach to ensure all valid `n` values are found.
