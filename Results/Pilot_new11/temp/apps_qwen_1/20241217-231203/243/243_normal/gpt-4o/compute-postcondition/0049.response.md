`right` is incremented by 1. The function call `func_1(7 * m + 3)` is required to equal `m`, but the value of `m` remains unchanged within the given constraints. The output state includes the updated value of `right` and retains the original condition for `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and `func_1(7 * m + 3)` must be equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1**
