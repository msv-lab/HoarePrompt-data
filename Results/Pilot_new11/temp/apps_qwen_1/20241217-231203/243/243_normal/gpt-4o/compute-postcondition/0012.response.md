The code assigns an empty list to the variable `result`. The value of `result` was previously an empty list, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `result`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than `m`.**
