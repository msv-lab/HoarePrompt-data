The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `low` and the value `5 * (m + 1)` to the variable `high`. The initial state of `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). After executing the code, the values of `m` remain unchanged, and the values of `low` and `high` are set as specified.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is 5 \* (`m` + 1)**
