The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`. After executing the code, the new value of `right` will be `(mid + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `mid + 3`.

The states of the other variables (`low`, `high`, `left`, and `func_1(mid + 2) == m`) are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 3`, and `func_1(mid + 2) == m`**
