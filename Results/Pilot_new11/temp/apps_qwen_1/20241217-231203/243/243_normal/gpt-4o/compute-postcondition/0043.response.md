`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` was \(7 \times m + 1\). After decrementing, `left` becomes \(7 \times m + 1 - 1 = 7 \times m\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\), `left` is \(7 \times m\)**
