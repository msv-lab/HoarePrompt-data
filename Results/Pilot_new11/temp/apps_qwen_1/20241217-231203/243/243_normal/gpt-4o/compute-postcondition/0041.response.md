`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` was originally \((7 \times m + 2)\). After decrementing, the new value of `left` is \((7 \times m + 1)\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\), `left` is \((7 \times m + 1)\)**
