The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `left` is not specified, let's denote it as `left_initial`. After executing `left -= 1`, the new value of `left` will be `left_initial - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`left` is `left_initial - 1`**
