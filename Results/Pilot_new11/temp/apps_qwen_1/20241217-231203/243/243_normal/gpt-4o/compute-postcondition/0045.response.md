The initial state provides the following:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\).
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`.
- `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\).
- `left` is \(7 \times m\).

The code snippet changes the value of `left` by subtracting 1 from it. Since `left` was initially defined as \(7 \times m\), after the operation, `left` becomes \(7 \times m - 1\).

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\), `left` is \(7 \times m - 1\)**
