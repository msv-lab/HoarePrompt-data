`result` is assigned the value of a list created by the `range` function starting from `left + 1` (which is `low`) to `right` (which is `mid + n`). The previous values of the other variables are not affected.

Since `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + n`, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the range starts from `low` and goes up to `mid + n`. The exact values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `n` are not specified, but we know the structure of the range.

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + n`, and `result` is a list created by the range from `low` to `mid + n`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + n`, and `result` is a list created by the range from `low` to `mid + n`**.
