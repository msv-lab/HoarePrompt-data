Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Although the modified version of `func_2` addresses the issue by returning `0` when no such \( n \) exists, the provided code still returns an empty list in such cases. The output hints confirm that the function returns either a range of integers satisfying the condition or an empty list if no such range is found. Since the problem description requires the program to output `0` when no such \( n \) exists, the current implementation still does not fully meet the requirements as specified. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs further modification to return `0` instead of an empty list when no such \( n \) is found.
