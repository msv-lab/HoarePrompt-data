According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:

- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `left` is `low - 1`
- `right` is `mid + 3`
- `func_1(mid + 2) == m`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. Given that `right` is currently `mid + 3`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 3) == m`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. The variable `right` should be `mid + 3` because this is the current value.
2. The condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true for the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition directly depends on `func_1(right) == m`, and we already know that `right` is `mid + 3`.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 3`, and `func_1(mid + 3) == m**
