`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `m` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The previous value of `m` (which was an integer between 1 and 100,000) is replaced by the new value entered.

Output State: **`m` is the integer value entered by the user, and it is between 1 and 100,000.**
