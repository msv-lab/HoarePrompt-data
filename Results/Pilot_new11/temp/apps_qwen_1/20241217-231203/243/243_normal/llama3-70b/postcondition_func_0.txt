The function accepts no parameters and calculates a sequence of numbers from 1 up to the largest number less than or equal to `m` that is not divisible by 5. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. If the final value of `n` is less than 5, the sequence includes all numbers from 1 to `n`; otherwise, the sequence remains unchanged. Potential edge cases include when `m` is less than 5, in which case the sequence will only contain 1, and when `m` is exactly 100,000, the function will still terminate correctly. However, the annotation stating that `n` is `n + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed is incorrect; instead, `n` increments by 1 in each iteration.
