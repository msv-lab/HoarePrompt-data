Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition given is `while True:`. This means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as no explicit break statement is encountered.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `n` is 1.

3. **Objective**: We need to determine the necessary adjustments to the state so that the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, there is no specific condition based on any variable that needs to be checked. The loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time unless a break statement is encountered inside the loop body. Since no break statement is provided in the problem context, we don't need to adjust any states related to the loop condition.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000, `count` is 0, and `n` is 1**
