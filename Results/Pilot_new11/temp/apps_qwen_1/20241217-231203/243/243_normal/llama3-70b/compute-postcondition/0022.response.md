Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000, `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}}\) is less than or equal to `m`, `n` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, and if \(n \// 5^{\text{count}} < m\), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs to the variables.***
