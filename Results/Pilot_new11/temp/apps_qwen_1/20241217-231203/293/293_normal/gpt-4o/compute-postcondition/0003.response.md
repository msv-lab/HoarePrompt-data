`visited_count` is assigned the value 0. The values of `h`, `n`, and `total_leaves` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0**
