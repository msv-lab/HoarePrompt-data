The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node` by doubling its previous value and adding 1. Given that `current_node` was initially 0, the new value of `current_node` will be \(2 \times 0 + 1 = 1\).

All other variables (`h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a non-empty binary string representing `n - 1` (padded to length `h` with leading zeros); `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 1; the direction is '0'**
