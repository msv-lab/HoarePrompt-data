`visited_count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a non-empty binary string representing `n - 1` (padded to length `h` with leading zeros); `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0.**
