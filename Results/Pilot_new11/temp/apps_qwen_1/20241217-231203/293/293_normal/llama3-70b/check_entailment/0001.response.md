Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the given algorithm. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the player needs to go back to the parent node after skipping two consecutive commands. This is evident from the test case `Input: 10 1024`, which should output `2046` based on the given algorithm, but the program will not produce the correct result because it does not account for the backtracking step when the player reaches a non-exit leaf node.
