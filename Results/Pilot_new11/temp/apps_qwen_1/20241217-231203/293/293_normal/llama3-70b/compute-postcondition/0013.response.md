The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Based on the initial state, `n` is half of `h` and is greater than 1. The value of `h` is an integer input from the user, so let's denote `n` as `h / 2`.

After the operation `n //= 2`, `n` will become `(h / 2) // 2`, which simplifies to `h // 4`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because this line of code does not affect `ans`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is `h // 4` and is greater than 1, `ans` is updated as per the initial condition.**
