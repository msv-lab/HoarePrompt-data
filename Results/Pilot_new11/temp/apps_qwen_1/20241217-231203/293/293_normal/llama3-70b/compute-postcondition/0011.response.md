`ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. Given that `n` is half of its original value (`h // 2`) and `n` must be greater than 1, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables (`h` and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value and `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to its original value.

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value and `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to its original value**.
