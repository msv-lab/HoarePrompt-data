The initial state is: `h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value and `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is updated according to the initial conditions.

The code snippet updates `ans` by adding `n // 2 - 1` to it. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `n` is already determined as half of the original value of `h`.
2. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `h` must be at least 2 (because if `h` is 1, `n` would be 0.5, which does not meet the condition).
3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to it.

Since `n` is `h // 2` and it is guaranteed to be greater than 1, we can express the updated value of `ans` as follows:

\[ \text{ans} = \text{ans} + \left(\frac{\text{h}}{2}\right) // 2 - 1 \]

Given that `h` is an integer and `n = h // 2`, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{ans} = \text{ans} + \left(\frac{\text{h}}{2}\right) // 2 - 1 \]

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value and `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is updated to \(\text{ans} + \left(\frac{\text{h}}{2}\right) // 2 - 1\)**
