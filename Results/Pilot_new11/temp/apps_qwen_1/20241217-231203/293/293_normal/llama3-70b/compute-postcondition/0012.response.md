Postcondition: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value and `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `n` is even, `ans` is updated to \(\text{ans} + \left(\frac{\text{h}}{2}\right) // 2 - 1\); otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to its original value.**
