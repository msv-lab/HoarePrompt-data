`plus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('+')`, which counts the number of '+' characters in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '-' and '+', the value of `plus_count` will be the number of '+' characters in `s`. The values of `n` and `minus_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' characters in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' characters in `s`.**
