The code prints the value of `plus_count - minus_count`. Since the exact values of `plus_count` and `minus_count` are not specified, we know that `plus_count` is greater than or equal to `minus_count`. The print statement does not change the values of the variables, but it outputs the result of `plus_count - minus_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' characters in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' characters in `s`; the print statement outputs `plus_count - minus_count`.**
