The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that the input consists of two lines: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second line is a string `s` of length `n` containing characters either "-" or "+".

After executing the code, the string `s` is assigned the value of the second line of input, and the integer `n` remains unchanged because no assignment to `n` is made in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line, `s` is the string input from the second line consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+"**
