Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of operations.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` containing characters either `'-'` (indicating removing a stone) or `'+ '` (indicating adding a stone).

2. **State Initialization**:
   - A variable `stones` is initialized to `0`. This variable keeps track of the net number of stones in the pile after performing all the operations.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each `'+ '` character, it increments the `stones` count by `1`.
   - For each `'-'` character, it decrements the `stones` count by `1`, but ensures that the `stones` count does not go below `0` using the `max(0, stones - 1)` operation.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all operations, the final value of `stones` is printed, which represents the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the first operation might be a `'-'` by ensuring that the `stones` count never goes below `0`.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and always produces the expected output for any valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
