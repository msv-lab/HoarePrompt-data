The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1. The initial value of `stones` is 1, so after executing this line, `stones` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is 2, and the next `operation` is the next character in `s`.**
