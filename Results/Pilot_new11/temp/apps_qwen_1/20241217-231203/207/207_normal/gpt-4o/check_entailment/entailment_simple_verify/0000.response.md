Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \). 

Here are the key issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Reachable Positions**: The function `func_2` uses a simplified approach to calculate the number of reachable positions, which does not handle all cases correctly. For example, in the first test case, the program incorrectly calculates \( f(5) \) and \( f(6) \) as 3 instead of 2, and \( f(7) \) as 8 instead of the correct number of reachable positions within the interval [0, 7].

2. **Incorrect Summation Logic**: The summation logic in `func_2` is also flawed. The function tries to split the problem into smaller subproblems, but it does not correctly account for the number of reachable positions for each interval.

Given these issues, the program fails to meet the problem requirements in various test cases. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
