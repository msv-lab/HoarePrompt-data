You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \).

Let's consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: \( m = 7, a = 5, b = 3 \)**

   According to the problem, we need to compute \( f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(7) \).
   - \( f(0) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 0)
   - \( f(1) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 1)
   - \( f(2) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 2)
   - \( f(3) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 3)
   - \( f(4) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 4)
   - \( f(5) = 3 \) (reachable positions are 5, 0, and -5 but since we restrict to [0, x], it's 5, 0)
   - \( f(6) = 3 \) (reachable positions are 6, 1, and -1 but since we restrict to [0, x], it's 6, 1)
   - \( f(7) = 8 \) (reachable positions are 7, 2, -3, -8, 12, -1, -6, -11)

   Summing these values gives us 19. However, the provided function `func_2` returns 10, which is incorrect.

2. **Case 2: \( m = 1000000000, a = 1, b = 2019 \)**

   For large values of \( m \), the function `func_2` uses a simplified approach which assumes \( g = 1 \). This is correct when \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), but the function should handle other cases as well. Given \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2019 \), the greatest common divisor is 1, so the function should work correctly. However, the output is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the sum of arithmetic series.

Since the program does not correctly compute \( f(i) \) for various cases, it fails to meet the problem requirements in all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where x >= y > 0.
def func_1(x, y):

        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y

def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :

    k = a + b - 1

    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k which is k * (k + 1) // 2 plus sum_m which is m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2, where k is a + b - 1`



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
