Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, leading to incorrect results.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distinct Reachable Integers:**
   - The core issue lies in the way the function `func_2` calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, m]`.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not accurately account for the distinct reachable integers based on the given jumps `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Use of GCD:**
   - While the function `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, the use of GCD in `func_2` does not help in calculating the distinct reachable integers. Instead, it simplifies the problem by reducing the values of `a` and `b` to their coprime form, which is not directly applicable here.

3. **Sum Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum of distinct reachable integers for each `i` from `0` to `m` is flawed. The current approach assumes a simple arithmetic progression, which is incorrect because the frog's movements are constrained by the specific jumps `a` and `b`.

### Example Analysis:
- For the first example (`7 5 3`):
  - The expected output is `19`, but the program fails to produce this result due to the incorrect logic.
- For the second example (`1000000000 1 2019`):
  - The program incorrectly calculates the sum as `500000001500000001`, which is not the correct result.
- For the third example (`100 100000 1`):
  - The program incorrectly outputs `101`, which does not match the expected behavior.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to consider the following:
1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`:** The LCM determines the step size that allows us to count the distinct reachable integers.
2. **Use the formula for the number of distinct integers:** The number of distinct integers reachable within `[0, m]` can be derived using the properties of LCM and the interval constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It uses the GCD unnecessarily and does not correctly calculate the number of distinct reachable integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
