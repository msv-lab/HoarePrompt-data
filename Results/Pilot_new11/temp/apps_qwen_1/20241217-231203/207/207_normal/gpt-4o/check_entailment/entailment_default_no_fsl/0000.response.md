Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It handles all the potential cases described in the problem statement and the output hints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it addresses the requirements:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that the recursive call in `func_2` works as intended.

2. **Recursive Case**: If the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g` and multiplies the result by `g`. This ensures that the problem is reduced to smaller subproblems with coprime `a` and `b`.

3. **Simple Arithmetic Case**: If `m < a + b - 1`, the function returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\). This handles the scenario where the maximum reachable position within the interval `[0, m]` is less than `a + b - 1`.

4. **Combined Summation Case**: For other cases, the function calculates the sum of two parts: `sum_k` and `sum_m`. `sum_k` covers the range up to `a + b - 1`, and `sum_m` covers the remaining range beyond `a + b - 1`. This ensures that all reachable positions are accounted for within the interval `[0, m]`.

Given that the code handles all potential cases as described and the output hints confirm its correctness, the program is correct for every potential case.
