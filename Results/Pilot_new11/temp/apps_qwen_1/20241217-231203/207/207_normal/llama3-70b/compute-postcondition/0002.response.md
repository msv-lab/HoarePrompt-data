The code `dp[0] = 1` sets the first element of the list `dp` to 1. This operation does not affect the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, or the other elements of the list `dp` except for the first one. Therefore, the value of `m` remains `input_m`, the value of `a` remains `input_a`, the value of `b` remains `input_b`, and the list `dp` changes such that its first element is 1 and the rest of the elements are still zeros.

Output State: **`m` is `input_m`, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are 0**
