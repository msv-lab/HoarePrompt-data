Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the code uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to reach each value from 0 to `m` using steps of size `a` and `-b`. However, the problem asks for the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, not the number of ways to reach each value.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input: `6 4 5`

The expected output is `10`, which is calculated as follows:
- `f(0) = 1` (only the starting point 0)
- `f(1) = 1` (only 1 itself)
- `f(2) = 1` (only 2 itself)
- `f(3) = 1` (only 3 itself)
- `f(4) = 3` (4, 8, 12)
- `f(5) = 4` (5, 9, 13, 17)
- `f(6) = 7` (6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30)

Summing these values gives `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 18`, not `10`.

The provided code does not account for the distinct integers reached but instead counts the number of ways to reach each integer, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
