You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the `coverage` function calculates the number of cells that would be covered by placing the scoop-net at position `(x, y)`, but it does not account for the fact that the scoop-net should not overlap with itself. This means that the `coverage` function can overestimate the number of cells that would be covered, leading to an incorrect expected value.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 3`
- The program suggests placing the fishes in cells `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.

However, when the scoop-net is placed at position `(2, 1)`, it will cover the cells `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(3, 2)`. This results in more than two fishes being caught, which is not consistent with the optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the `coverage` function needs to ensure that the scoop-net does not overlap with itself, and the placement of fishes should maximize the expected value of caught fishes. The current implementation does not achieve this, making the program incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5). The function coverage(x, y) returns the number of possible scoop-net positions that would catch the fish placed at cell (x, y).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n * m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples (`-coverage(i, j)`, `i`, `j`) for all `i` in range(`n`) and `j` in range(`m`), and `x` is `n-1`
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_coverage` is `0 - k * cov`, `_` is a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `cov` is the smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration, `x` is the second smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration, `y` is the third smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #`The program returns (0 - k * cov) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond where a fish is placed, n and m are the dimensions of the pond (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), and r is the size of the scoop-net (with 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 2, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 2, 0))



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
