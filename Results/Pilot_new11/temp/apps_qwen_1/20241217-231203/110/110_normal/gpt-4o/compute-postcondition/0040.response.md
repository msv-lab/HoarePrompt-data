Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, representing dimensions of a grid, the radius of coverage for scoops, and the number of scoops, respectively. It returns the average reduction in coverage due to the placement of `k` scoops on the grid, normalized by the total number of possible positions for scoops not intersecting within the radius `r`. Specifically, it constructs a priority queue of all possible scoop positions based on their coverage, pops the `k` positions with the smallest coverage, subtracts their combined coverage from the total, and then normalizes this reduction by the total number of valid scoop positions.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is zero, the function returns 0 since no positions are considered.
- If `k` is equal to `n * m`, the function will consider all possible positions, and the normalization factor will be the total number of positions.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the `coverage(x, y)` function is defined elsewhere and correctly computes the coverage for a given position `(x, y)`. If `coverage(x, y)` is not defined or does not behave as expected, the function may produce incorrect results.
