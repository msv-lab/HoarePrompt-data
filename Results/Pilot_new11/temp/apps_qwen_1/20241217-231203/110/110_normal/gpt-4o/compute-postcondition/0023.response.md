`heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` adds a new tuple to the heap. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `y` is 2. So, the tuple added to the heap is `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`. The heap now contains tuples from the initial state plus this new tuple. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `r` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), `k` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples (`-coverage(i, j)`, `i`, `j`) for all `i` in range(`n`) and `j` in range(`m`), and the new tuple (`-coverage(2, 2)`, `2`, `2`), `x` is 2**
