The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops an element from the heap and assigns it to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact structure or contents of the heap, so we can only state that the heap's first element is removed and its values are assigned to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `total_coverage` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap**
