The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap `heap` and assigns its values to `cov`, `x`, and `y` respectively. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values in the heap, only the initial values of other variables. The heap could contain any elements, but for the sake of this example, let's consider the initial values of `total_coverage` and other variables.

Given that `_` is 0 (unchanged), `k` is a positive integer greater than 1 (unchanged), and `x` is `y` (unchanged), the only variables that change are `cov`, `x`, and `y`.

Since the heap is not specified, let's assume the heap contains elements such that the smallest element is popped and assigned to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. The exact values of these elements depend on the heap's content, which is not given.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `cov` is now the smallest element from the heap.
- `x` is now the second smallest element from the heap.
- `y` is now the third smallest element from the heap.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0 - `x`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `cov` is the smallest element from the heap, `x` is the second smallest element from the heap, `y` is the third smallest element from the heap.**
