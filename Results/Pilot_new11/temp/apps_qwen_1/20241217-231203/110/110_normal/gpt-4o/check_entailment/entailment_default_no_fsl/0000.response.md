Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code for `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. The function aims to maximize the expected number of caught fishes by placing `k` fishes in such a way that the average number of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is placed randomly. However, the approach used in `func_1` is incorrect.

The function `func_1` uses a priority queue to store the coverage of each cell, which is calculated by the `coverage` function. The idea seems to be to place `k` fishes in the cells with the highest coverage, but the calculation of coverage in the `coverage` function is flawed.

The `coverage` function calculates the number of cells that can be covered by a scoop-net of size `r` when placed at coordinates `(x, y)`. However, the calculation of the coverage is incorrect. Specifically, the function uses:

```python
(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
```

This formula incorrectly calculates the number of cells that can be covered. For example, consider a case where `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `r = 2`, and `x = 3`, `y = 3`. The correct coverage should be 3 (cells (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)), but the current implementation would calculate it as 4 (since the formula considers the boundary conditions incorrectly).

To fix this, the correct formula should be:

```python
(min(x + r - 1, n) - max(x - r + 1, 0) + 1) * (min(y + r - 1, m) - max(y - r + 1, 0) + 1)
```

This formula correctly calculates the number of cells that can be covered in both the x and y directions, taking into account the boundaries of the pond.

Since the `coverage` function is incorrect, the entire solution provided in `func_1` is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many potential cases. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
