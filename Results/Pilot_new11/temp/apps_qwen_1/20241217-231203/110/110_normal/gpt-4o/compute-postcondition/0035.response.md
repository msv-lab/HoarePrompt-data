`total_coverage` is updated by subtracting `cov` from its current value. The previous value of `total_coverage` was `0 - x - cov`. After subtracting `cov`, the new value of `total_coverage` becomes `0 - x - cov - cov`, which simplifies to `0 - x - 2 * cov`. The states of the other variables (`_`, `cov`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is `0 - x - 2 * cov`, `_` is `0`, `cov` is the new smallest element from the heap, `x` is the new second smallest element from the heap, `y` is the new third smallest element from the heap**
