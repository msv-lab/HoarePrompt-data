The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple into the heap. However, the function `coverage(x, y)` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of the tuple being pushed. We know that `x` and `y` are 0 from the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is a positive integer
- `r` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)
- `k` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5)
- `heap` is an empty list
- `y` is 0

After executing the code, the heap will contain the tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`. Since `y` is 0, the heap will be updated with this new element. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `r` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), `k` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5), `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, and `y` is 0**
