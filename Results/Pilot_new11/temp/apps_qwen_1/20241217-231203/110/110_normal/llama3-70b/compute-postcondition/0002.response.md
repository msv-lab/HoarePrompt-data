The code calculates `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` and prints it. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, and no new variables are assigned values. Therefore, the only impact is on the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range [1, 100000]; `m` is an input integer within the range [1, 100000]; `r` is an input integer within the range [1, min(`n`, `m`)]; `k` is an input integer within the range [1, min(`n` * `m`, 100000)]; `ans` is the minimum value between `k` and (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1); print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))**
