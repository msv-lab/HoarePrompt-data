Functionality: **The function reads four integers \(n\), \(m\), \(r\), and \(k\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n \times m, 10^5)\). It calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the product of \((n - r + 1)\) and \((m - r + 1)\), then prints the ratio of this minimum value to the product \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). This ratio represents the fraction of the area of a submatrix of size \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\) out of the total possible submatrices. The function does not handle any input validation and assumes the input adheres to the given constraints. If the input does not meet these constraints, the behavior is undefined.**

Edge Cases:
- If \(n < 1\) or \(m < 1\), the program will behave unpredictably because the constraints are violated.
- If \(r < 1\) or \(r > \min(n, m)\), the program will also behave unpredictably due to constraint violations.
- If \(k < 1\) or \(k > \min(n \times m, 10^5)\), the program will still calculate the values as long as the other constraints are met, but the results may not be meaningful in practical contexts.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not provide any output if the input does not meet the specified constraints. It should ideally validate the input before proceeding with the calculations.
