Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the Mex (Minimum Excluded) value after applying operations to make each element \( \leq a_i \). However, the program does not account for the possibility of decreasing elements to achieve different Mex values.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the Mex value. This approach assumes that the array is already in its optimal form to maximize the Mex value, which is not true. The program does not consider the possibility of reducing elements to achieve a higher Mex value.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: Given the input `5` and `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the program sorts the array to `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]` and finds Mex as `5`. While this is a valid Mex value, it is not necessarily the maximum possible Mex value after performing operations.
     - One could decrease the second element to `2` and the fifth element to `4`, making the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, and the Mex would be `5`. The program does not consider this possibility.
   - **Example 2**: Given the input `2` and `[2, 1]`, the program finds Mex as `3`. While this is correct, it does not show the issue clearly. The program should check if decreasing the elements could yield a higher Mex value.

4. **General Case**: The program does not handle the general case where elements can be reduced to achieve a higher Mex value. It simply assumes the sorted array is the optimal form, which is not always true.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the following steps:
- Initialize Mex as `1`.
- Iterate through the array and for each element:
  - If the element is greater than the current Mex, break the loop as further elements cannot increase Mex.
  - Otherwise, increment Mex until finding the next possible value that is not present in the array.
- Print the final Mex value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        while num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program considers all possible reductions to maximize the Mex value.
