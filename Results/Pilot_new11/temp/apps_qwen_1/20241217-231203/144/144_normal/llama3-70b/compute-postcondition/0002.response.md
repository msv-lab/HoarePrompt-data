The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting an input string, the exact values of `arr` are not specified, but they are integers.

After sorting, the list `arr` will be in ascending order, but the specific values depend on the input string. However, we know that the list was originally composed of integers derived from an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string**
