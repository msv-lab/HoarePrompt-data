Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility of reducing elements to values less than the current `mex` value, which is crucial for maximizing the `mex`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

The program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `4`. Here's why:

- Initially, `mex` is set to `1`.
- The first element `2` is compared with `1`, so `mex` remains `1`.
- The second element `2` is also compared with `1`, so `mex` remains `1`.
- The third element `2` is again compared with `1`, so `mex` remains `1`.

Since no element is greater than `1`, the loop breaks, and the final `mex` is `1`. However, we can reduce each `2` to `1`, resulting in the array `[1, 1, 1]`, which has a `mex` of `2`. Further reductions could yield an array like `[1, 1, 2]` with a `mex` of `3`, and finally, `[1, 2, 3]` with a `mex` of `4`.

Thus, the program does not correctly maximize the `mex` value in all cases.
