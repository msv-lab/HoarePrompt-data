Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the initial state:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `mex` is either 1 or 2.
   - If `num` (which is `n`) equals `mex`, then `mex` remains unchanged and is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged and is either 1 or 2.

2. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `arr`.

3. **Analyze what happens inside the loop:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the effect of iterating over the list. Each iteration processes one element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `num` (which is `n`) is one of the elements from the list `arr`.
   - If `num` equals `mex`, `mex` remains unchanged and is either 2 or 3.
   - If `num` does not equal `mex`, `mex` remains unchanged and is either 1 or 2.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more element in `arr` to process.

5. **Update the states for the next iteration:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is the current element being processed in the list.
   - `arr` loses one element since the loop has processed one element.
   - `mex` remains unchanged based on the condition described.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` is the current element from the list `arr`.
- `arr` is the list after removing one element.
- `mex` remains either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` and `mex` cannot be determined without knowing the specific element in `arr` and its relationship to `mex`, we can express the state as follows:

**State: **`n` is the current element from the list `arr`, `arr` is the list after removing one element, `mex` is either 1 or 2**.
