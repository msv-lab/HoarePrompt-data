Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code only checks if the current number `num` is equal to `mex` or greater than `mex`. This approach fails to account for the scenario where the array can contain duplicate values, which can prevent the mex value from incrementing correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 1 2 2
```

The correct output should be `3` because Alyona can decrease the second and fourth elements to `1` and the third element to `1`, resulting in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The mex of this array is `3`.

However, the provided code would incorrectly output `2` because it only increments `mex` when the current number is exactly equal to `mex`, without considering the possibility of decreasing elements to values less than `mex`.

To fix this, the code should ensure that it correctly handles the possibility of decreasing elements to values less than `mex` and should properly check for the presence of each integer up to the current `mex` value in the sorted array.
