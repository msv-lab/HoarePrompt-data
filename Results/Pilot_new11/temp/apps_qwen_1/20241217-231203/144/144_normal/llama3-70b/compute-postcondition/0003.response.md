The line `mex = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `mex`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string; `mex` is 1**
