State before the loop starts: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 1.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must be non-empty because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.

Let's break down the requirements:
1. The variable `a` must be a non-empty list of integers.
2. The variable `mex` is already set to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `mex`.
3. The variable `n` is an integer and its value does not directly affect the loop execution but could be used within the loop body.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `a` must be a non-empty list of integers.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 1**
