Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Operation**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the sorted list `a`. For each `num`, if `num` is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. This operation continues until no further increments are possible because `num` is less than the current `mex`.

2. **Termination Condition**: The loop will terminate when there are no more elements in `a` that are greater than or equal to `mex`. At this point, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`.

3. **Final Value of `mex`**:
   - If `a` contains all integers from 0 to `k-1` for some `k`, then `mex` will be `k`.
   - If `a` does not contain any integers, then `mex` will be 0.
   - If `a` contains integers but gaps exist, `mex` will be the smallest integer not in `a`.

4. **No Execution Case**: If `a` is an empty list, then `mex` will remain 1 as per the initial state.

Thus, after the loop completes, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`.
