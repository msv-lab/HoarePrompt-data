Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the initial state**: 
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `mex` is 2.
   - If an element `num` in `a` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is set to 3. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `n`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Identify the changes made in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the current element `num` is checked against `mex`.
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is set to 3.
   - Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, and the next element in `a` is processed.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `mex` is 2.
   - After the previous iteration, if `num` was greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` would be set to 3. Otherwise, `mex` remains 2.

5. **Determine the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - `n` does not change during the loop.
   - If `num` in the previous iteration was less than `mex` (which is 2), then `mex` remains 2.
   - If `num` in the previous iteration was greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is now 3.

Given the above analysis, we need to consider both scenarios:

- If `num` was less than `mex` (2), the state remains the same.
- If `num` was greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is now 3.

Since the problem does not specify which scenario occurred, we should consider the most general case where `mex` could be either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `num` in the previous iteration.

Thus, the state for the next iteration can be described as follows:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 2 or 3**.

However, to provide a clear and concise answer, we should assume the most general case:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 2 or 3**.
