The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variable values. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0**
