According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop can execute again if `r` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`
- For `i` from `1` to `n`, `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`
- The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`
- `k` is `2`
- `l` is `1`
- `r` is `1`
- `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `r` must be increased by 1, so it becomes `2`
- `prefix_sum[r]` must still be not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `2`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`**
