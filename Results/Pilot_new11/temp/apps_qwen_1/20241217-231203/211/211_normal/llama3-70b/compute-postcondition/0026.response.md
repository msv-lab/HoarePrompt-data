Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `2`, `r` is `2`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]` since the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` leads to the assignment of `k` to `3` and `l` to `2`, and does not change the values of `prefix_sum` array or other conditions specified in the precondition.***
