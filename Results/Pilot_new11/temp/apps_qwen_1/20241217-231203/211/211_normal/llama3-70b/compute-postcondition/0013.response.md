The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints a string to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`.**
