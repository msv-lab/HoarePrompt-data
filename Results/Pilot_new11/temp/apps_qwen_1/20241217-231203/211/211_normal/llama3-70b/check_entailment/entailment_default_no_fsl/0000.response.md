Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the array `A` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0). According to the problem description, if the input array `A` is empty, the program should return "NO". However, the current implementation does not check for this condition and will attempt to read and process the array, which will result in an error when `n` is 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
