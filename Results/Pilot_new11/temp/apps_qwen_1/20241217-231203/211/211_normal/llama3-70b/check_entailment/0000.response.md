Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the entire array sums to zero correctly. According to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, it should output "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and prints "NO" without considering other potential subarrays. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-1 1 -1
```

The sum of the entire array is zero, but the program would incorrectly print "YES" because it finds a subarray from index 1 to 2 whose sum is not zero, and then prints "YES" without checking the final condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in all potential cases.
