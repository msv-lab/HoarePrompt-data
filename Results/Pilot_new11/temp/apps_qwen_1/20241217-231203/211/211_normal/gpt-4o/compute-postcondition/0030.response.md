Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- \( A \) is a list of \( n \) integers.
- \( total\_sum \) is the sum of all elements in \( A \).
- \( total\_sum \) is initially equal to 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if A[i] != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('2')
        print('1', i + 1)
        print(i + 2, n)
        break
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will only execute if there exists at least one element in the list \( A \) that is not zero.
   - If no such element exists, the loop will not execute, and the statement inside the `else` block will run.

2. **Effect of Loop Execution**:
   - If the loop executes, it will print specific outputs and break out of the loop.
   - If the loop does not execute, it will print "NO".

3. **Final State Determination**:
   - **If the loop executes**:
     - The loop will find the first non-zero element in \( A \) and print the specified outputs.
     - The loop variable \( i \) will be set to the index of the first non-zero element.
     - Since the loop breaks, it will not iterate further.
   - **If the loop does not execute**:
     - The loop variable \( i \) will be set to \( n \) (since the loop completes its full iteration without finding a non-zero element).
     - The statement inside the `else` block will print "NO".

### Final Output State:
- If the loop executes, \( i \) will be set to the index of the first non-zero element in \( A \).
- If the loop does not execute, \( i \) will be \( n \).
- The values of \( n \) and \( A \) will remain unchanged.
- The statement "NO" will be printed if the loop does not execute.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \); `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; if the loop executes, `i` is the index of the first non-zero element in `A`, and the statements 'YES', '2', '1 i+1', 'i+2 n' are printed; if the loop does not execute, `i` is `n`, and 'NO' is printed.**
