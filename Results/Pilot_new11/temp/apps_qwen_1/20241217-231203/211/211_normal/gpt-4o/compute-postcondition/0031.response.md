Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not zero, the printed output is '1' and `n`. Otherwise, if `total_sum` is zero, either the index of the first non-zero element in `A` is found and the printed output is 'YES', '2', '1 i+1', 'i+2 n', or if no such element exists, the printed output is 'NO'.***
