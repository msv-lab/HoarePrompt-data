The code prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The value of `i` is 5, so `i + 2` is 7. The value of `n` is greater than 4, and it remains unchanged. The other variables (`A`, `total_sum`) are not affected by this code. The print statement does not change the values of the variables, but it outputs the values of `i + 2` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 5, and the output is '7 4'**
