The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variable values or states; it only prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`; the printed output is 'YES'**
