The code `print('1')` simply prints the string '1' to the console. This does not change the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`; the printed output is '1'**
