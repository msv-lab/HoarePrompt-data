The code `rec_stack[node] = True` assigns the value `True` to the element in the `rec_stack` set at the index corresponding to the `node` variable. This changes the value of `rec_stack[node]` from its previous value (which was undefined or possibly `False` if it was already initialized) to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex points to, `visited` is a set of integers representing vertices that have been visited during the recursion and now includes `node`, `rec_stack` is a set of integers where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.**
