Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly determines whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`), which is appropriate for checking cycles in a directed graph.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` uses a depth-first search (DFS) with recursion to detect cycles. This approach is effective because if a back edge (a reference to a previously visited node that is still in the recursion stack) is found, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
3. **Single Edge Removal Check**: After detecting a cycle, the program attempts to check if removing any single edge from the graph would make it acyclic. This is done implicitly by attempting to find a cycle again after each edge removal.
4. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input constraints (number of vertices and edges) and processes each edge to build the graph.
5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if it can remove at most one edge to make the graph acyclic and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:

- **Cycle Detection**: The DFS-based cycle detection in `func_1` ensures that cycles are correctly identified.
- **Edge Removal Check**: By re-running the cycle detection after removing each edge, the program checks if removing any single edge can make the graph acyclic.
- **Input Validity Assumption**: The problem statement specifies that the input will be valid, so the program's assumptions about the input being well-formed are justified.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to check if a graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge, it meets the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
