Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node` and at least one unvisited neighbor, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and there is at least one more unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`, then the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function continues with the rest of the code (though the exact behavior of the rest of the code is not specified in the provided information).***
