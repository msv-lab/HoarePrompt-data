Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code confirms that the `func_1` function only checks for cycles in the graph starting from a given node without attempting to remove any edges. The problem requires checking whether the graph becomes acyclic by removing at most one edge. The annotated version does not show any logic to temporarily remove an edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic, which is necessary to solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements and cannot be considered correct based on the provided problem description and annotations.
