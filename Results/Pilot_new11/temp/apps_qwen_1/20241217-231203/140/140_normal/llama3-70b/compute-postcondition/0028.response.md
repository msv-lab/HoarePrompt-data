Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex points to.
- `visited` is a set of integers representing vertices that have been visited during the recursion.
- `rec_stack` is a set of integers representing vertices in the current recursion stack.

The function checks for cycles in the graph starting from the given `node`. It marks the `node` as visited and adds it to the recursion stack. For each neighbor of the `node`, it recursively checks if the neighbor is part of a cycle. If any neighbor is already visited and in the recursion stack, it means a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`. If no such neighbor exists, it removes the `node` from the recursion stack and returns `False`.

The function returns `True` in multiple cases where a cycle is detected and `False` when no cycle is found after exploring all neighbors.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the detection of cycles and the handling of recursion stack and visited nodes.
