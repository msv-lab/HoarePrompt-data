Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly check for cycles in the graph after removing at most one edge. The `func_1` function checks for cycles using depth-first search (DFS) with recursion, but it does not attempt to remove any edge before checking for cycles. To solve this problem, the program needs to iterate through each edge and temporarily remove it, then check if the graph becomes acyclic. If removing any single edge makes the graph acyclic, the program should return 'YES'. If no single edge removal makes the graph acyclic, the program should return 'NO'. The current implementation does not perform this step, hence it fails to meet the problem requirements.
