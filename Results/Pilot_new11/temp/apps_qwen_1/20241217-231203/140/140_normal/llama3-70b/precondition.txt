The function `dfs` takes four parameters: `node` (an integer representing the current node being visited), `graph` (a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing outgoing edges from the key node), `visited` (a set of integers representing nodes that have been visited during the current DFS traversal), and `rec_stack` (a set of integers representing nodes in the current recursion stack).
