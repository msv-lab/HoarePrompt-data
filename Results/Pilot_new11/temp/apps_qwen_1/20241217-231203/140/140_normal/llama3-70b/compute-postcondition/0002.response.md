According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `graph` and the integer `node`. For the loop to execute, `node` must be a key in the `graph` dictionary, and `graph[node]` must contain at least one element (i.e., at least one neighbor).

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Node as a Key in Graph**: The loop iterates over the neighbors of `node`. Therefore, `node` must exist as a key in the `graph` dictionary.
2. **Neighbors Existence**: The value associated with `node` in the `graph` dictionary (`graph[node]`) must be a non-empty list to ensure there is at least one neighbor.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the initial state to reflect that `node` exists in the keys of `graph` and that `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.

State: **`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node`, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`**
