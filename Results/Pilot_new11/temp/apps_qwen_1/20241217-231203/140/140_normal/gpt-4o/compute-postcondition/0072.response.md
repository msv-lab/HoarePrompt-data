`queue` appends the value of `neighbor` to itself. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` remains unchanged, and the value of `node` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 or -1, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node` plus `neighbor`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 or -1, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node` plus `neighbor`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`**
