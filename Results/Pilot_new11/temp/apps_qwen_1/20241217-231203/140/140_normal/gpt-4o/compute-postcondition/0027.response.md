`count` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `in_degree` and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0; `count` is 0.
