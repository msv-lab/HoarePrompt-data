`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is `in_degree[v] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[u]` must have at least two vertices, `in_degree[v]` is `in_degree[v] + 1`, `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must have at least two vertices, `in_degree[v]` is `in_degree[v] + 1`, `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`**
