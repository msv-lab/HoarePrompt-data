The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph[u]` must have at least one vertex; `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1 to become `in_degree[v] + 1`; `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`.**
