The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` node to the right end of the `queue`. The value of `neighbor` is the node that had its in-degree decremented to 0 after `node` was removed from the left end of `queue`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation, except for the fact that `queue` now contains one more element.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (including the newly added `neighbor`); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0.**
