Postcondition: ***`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph. `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0, possibly updated with the new value of `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was reduced to 0. `count` is `count + 2`, `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.***

Explanation: 
- If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `neighbor` is added to `queue`.
- If `in_degree[neighbor]` does not equal 0, the condition is not met, and no additional changes occur to `queue`, `count`, `node`, or `in_degree`.
