The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since the value of `neighbor` is not specified in the initial state, it remains unspecified. However, we know that `in_degree[neighbor]` was previously -1 and now it will be updated to 0. The `queue` will have one additional element, which is the `neighbor`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `queue` contains the elements it had before plus `neighbor`, `node` is the first node from `queue`**
