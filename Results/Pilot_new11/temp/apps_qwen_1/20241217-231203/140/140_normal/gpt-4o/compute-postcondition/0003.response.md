`in_degree[v]` is assigned the value of `in_degree[v] + 1`. Since `v` is a key in `in_degree`, its initial value is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `in_degree[v]` will be updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is 1, `graph` must have at least one key, `u` must be a key in `graph`**
