The code initializes a queue with nodes (keys from `in_degree`) that have an in-degree of 0. This means these nodes have no incoming edges.

Let's denote the keys in `in_degree` as integers from 1 to `n`. For each key `node` in `in_degree`, if `in_degree[node] == 0`, it is added to the `queue`.

- The `queue` is updated with the nodes that have zero in-degree.
- The `in_degree` dictionary remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0.**
