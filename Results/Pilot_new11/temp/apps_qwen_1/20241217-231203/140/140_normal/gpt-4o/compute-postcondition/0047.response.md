`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `in_degree` and the contents of `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the updated number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` does not contain the node that was removed (the first element of `queue`); `count` is increased by 1.
