Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and the value of `in_degree[v]` for any vertex `v` in the graph is the number of edges directed into `v`, `graph` must have at least one key.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each vertex `u` in the graph and increments the `in_degree` count for each vertex `v` that `u` points to.
- After the loop completes, `in_degree[v]` for any vertex `v` in the graph will be the total number of edges directed into `v`. This is because every time a vertex `u` points to `v`, the loop increments `in_degree[v]` by 1.
- The loop will only execute if `graph` contains at least one key (indicating there is at least one vertex in the graph).
- The initial state of `in_degree` being 0 for all keys from 1 to `n` ensures that the count starts fresh for each vertex before the loop begins.

Thus, the final state of `in_degree` will reflect the number of incoming edges for each vertex in the graph, based on the structure defined by `graph`.
