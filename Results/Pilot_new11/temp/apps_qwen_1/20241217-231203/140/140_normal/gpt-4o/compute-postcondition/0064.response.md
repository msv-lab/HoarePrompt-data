The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The other variables (`in_degree`, `queue`, and `node`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `count` is the original value plus 1.

Output State: **all nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0; `queue` contains at least one less node; `node` is the first node from `queue`; `count` is the number of nodes processed plus 2.**
