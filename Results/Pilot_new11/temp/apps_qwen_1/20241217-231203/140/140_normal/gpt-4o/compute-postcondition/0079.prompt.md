ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times:  n must initially be greater than 0, `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` must have been greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` must have been  had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students', inital value of students must have been greater than 0
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 1
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 2

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
```
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    count += 1
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
        if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
            queue.append(neighbor)

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: To determine the final state of the program after the for loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each neighbor of the node that was removed from the queue. For each neighbor, it decrements the in-degree of that neighbor. If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes zero, it gets appended to the queue.

### Initial State
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into vertex `v` from all other vertices in the graph.
- `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (but one node has been removed).
- `count` is initially set to some value and then incremented by 2.
- `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`.

### Loop Execution
- Each iteration of the loop processes a neighbor of the current `node`.
- The in-degree of each neighbor is decremented.
- If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, it is appended to the `queue`.

### Output State After All Iterations
Let's consider the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished.

#### Final Values of Variables
- **`in_degree`**: This dictionary will retain the updated in-degrees of all nodes after all possible decrements due to the removal of the initial node and subsequent neighbors.
- **`queue`**: This deque will contain all nodes that have an in-degree of 0 after processing all neighbors of the initial node and any further neighbors added during the loop iterations.
- **`count`**: This variable will be incremented by 2 for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the final value of `count` will be the initial value of `count` plus 2 times the number of iterations.
- **`node`**: This variable will hold the last node that was removed from the left end of `queue`.

#### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are nodes with an in-degree of 0 in the queue.
- Once there are no more nodes with an in-degree of 0, the loop will terminate.

### Final Output State
Given that the loop will terminate when there are no more nodes with an in-degree of 0, the final state of the program can be described as follows:

**Output State:**
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the updated number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph.
- `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0.
- `count` is the initial value of `count` plus 2 times the number of iterations of the loop.
- `node` is the last node that was removed from the left end of `queue`.

This is the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0, `queue` contains all nodes that originally had an in-degree of zero, and `count` is the number of nodes processed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: all nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0, `queue` is empty, `node` is undefined, `count` is the total number of nodes processed plus 2.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
