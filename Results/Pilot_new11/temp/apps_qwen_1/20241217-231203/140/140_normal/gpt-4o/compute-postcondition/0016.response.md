Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for any vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the original number of edges directed into `v` plus the number of times the loop has executed; `u` remains the same; and `graph[u]` must have at least one vertex for the loop to execute at least once. If the loop does not execute, `in_degree` remains unchanged.**
