`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, meaning its value is reduced by 1. The value of `queue` and `node` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `in_degree[neighbor]` is now one less than its previous value.
- `queue` contains the updated neighbors based on the condition.
- `node` is the next node from `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to its previous value minus 1, `queue` contains the updated neighbors based on the condition, and `node` is the next node from `queue`.**
