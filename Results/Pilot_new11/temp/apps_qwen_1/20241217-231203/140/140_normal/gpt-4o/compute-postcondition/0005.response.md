The code increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Initially, `in_degree[v]` is set to 1. After executing the line `in_degree[v] += 1`, the value of `in_degree[v]` will become 2.

The states of the other variables and the dictionaries `in_degree` and `graph` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is 2, `graph` must have at least one key, `u` must be a key in `graph`**
