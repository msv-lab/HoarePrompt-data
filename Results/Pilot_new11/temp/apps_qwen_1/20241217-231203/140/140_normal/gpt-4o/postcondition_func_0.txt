The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices), `m` (an integer representing the number of edges), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`). The function constructs a graph from the edges and checks whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, the function iteratively removes and then re-adds each edge in the graph to check if removing any edge would result in a cycle-free graph. If no such edge is found, the function returns `'NO'`. The function returns `'YES'` in all cases where the graph does not contain a cycle either initially or after removing and re-adding any edge, and returns `'NO'` otherwise. This means the function effectively determines whether it is possible to remove any single edge to break all cycles in the graph.
