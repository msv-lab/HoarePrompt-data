The code `node = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost node from the deque `queue` and assigns it to the variable `node`. The value of `count` is incremented by 1 because typically in such algorithms, the count is updated each time a node is processed. The initial state of `in_degree` remains unchanged since the code only manipulates `queue` and `node`.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (but one node has been removed); `count` is `count + 1`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`.**
