The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. This means that the in-degree of the `neighbor` node is reduced by 1. The `neighbor` is a node that is connected to the `node` that was removed from the left end of `queue`. The other variables (`in_degree`, `queue`, `count`, and `node`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph, `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0, `count` is `count + 2`, `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
