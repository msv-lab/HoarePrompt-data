`queue` is appended with `neighbor`. The value of `in_degree[neighbor_y]` is not directly affected by this line of code, and the condition for whether `neighbor_y` was in `queue` before is maintained. The value of `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` still contains at least one neighbor. 

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor_y]` is decreased by 1, `queue` contains `neighbor_y` if its `in_degree` was 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.**
