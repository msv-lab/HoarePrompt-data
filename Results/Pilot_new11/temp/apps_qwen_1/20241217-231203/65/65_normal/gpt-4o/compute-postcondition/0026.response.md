The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block affecting these variables in the given code snippet, the values of `count` and `can_distribute` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is an integer greater than `k`, and `can_distribute` is `False`.**
