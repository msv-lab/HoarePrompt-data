Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a character from the string `s` and its value is the count of that character in the string `s`; `max_color_count` is the maximum value among the counts of characters in `s`. The condition `max_color_count <= k` is satisfied.***
