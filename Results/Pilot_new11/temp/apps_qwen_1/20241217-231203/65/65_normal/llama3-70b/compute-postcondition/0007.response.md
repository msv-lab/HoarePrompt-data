`color_count[c]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `c` was not previously in `color_count`, this initializes a new key-value pair where `c` is the key and `1` is the value. The state of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is not in `color_count`, `color_count[c]` is 1**
