The function takes no input arguments. The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the elements of the sequence.
