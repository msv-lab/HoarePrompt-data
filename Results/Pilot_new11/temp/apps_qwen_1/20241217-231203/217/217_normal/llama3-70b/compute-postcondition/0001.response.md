The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is that it is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Therefore, after executing the code, `n` is still an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is now a list of `n` integers, each satisfying -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100**
