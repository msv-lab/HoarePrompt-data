`b` is incremented by `a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `a[1]`, so let's denote it as `a_1`. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and `c` is increased by `a[0]`, but the value of `c` itself is not specified. The initial state does not give a specific value for `c` or `a[0]`, so let's denote it as `c_0`. 

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `b` is increased by `a_1`.
- `c` is increased by `a[0]`, which we denote as `c_0 + a[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is increased by `a[1]`, `c` is increased by `a[0]`**
