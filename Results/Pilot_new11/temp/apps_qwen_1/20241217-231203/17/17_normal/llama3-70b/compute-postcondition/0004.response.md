The code `print(1)` prints the integer `1` but does not affect the values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. The precondition that `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1` remains valid.

Output State: **`cnt1` is the first input integer, `cnt2` is the second input integer, `cnt3` is the third input integer, `cnt4` is the fourth input integer, `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, and print output is 1**
