`cnt3` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt4` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is the value of `int(input())`, `cnt4` is the original integer.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is the value of `int(input())`, `cnt4` is the original integer**
