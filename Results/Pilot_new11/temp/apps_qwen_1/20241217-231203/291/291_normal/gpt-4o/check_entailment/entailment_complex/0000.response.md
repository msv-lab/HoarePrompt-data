Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of segments that Sofia must draw with a ruler (without using existing segments as guides) to draw \( n \) squares.
   - Each square requires 4 segments.
   - For \( n \) squares, \( 4n \) segments would be needed if no segments were reused. However, we aim to minimize the number of ruler-drawn segments by reusing existing segments as much as possible.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler, we need to find a way to reuse existing segments.
   - By drawing \( a \) rows of \( b \) columns of squares, we can use existing segments as guides for subsequent segments.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - We need to partition the \( n \) squares into rows and columns.
   - Let \( a \) be the number of rows and \( b \) be the number of columns such that \( ab = n \).
   - Each row contributes \( b \) horizontal segments and each column contributes \( a \) vertical segments.
   - The total number of segments drawn with a ruler is \( 2(a + b) \).

4. **Optimization**:
   - To minimize \( 2(a + b) \), we iterate over all possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) and compute \( b = \lceil \frac{n}{a} \rceil \).
   - We keep track of the minimum value of \( 2(a + b) \).

5. **Implementation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer \( n \) and returns the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler.
   - It iterates over all possible values of \( a \) and calculates \( b \) accordingly.
   - It updates `min_segments_needed` with the smallest value of \( 2(a + b) \).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
   - It considers all possible ways to partition \( n \) squares into rows and columns.
   - It finds the optimal partition that minimizes the number of segments drawn with a ruler.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, and it is always correct for the given input constraints.
