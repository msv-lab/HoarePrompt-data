Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed for Sofia to draw \( n \) squares. The logic in the `func_1` function seems to be attempting to find a combination of \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( ab = n \), but the formula used to calculate `segments_needed` is incorrect. Specifically, the formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \) does not accurately represent the minimum number of segments needed.

For example, consider the input \( n = 4 \):
- The correct minimum number of segments needed is 4. Sofia can draw 2 vertical segments and 2 horizontal segments, each with a ruler once, and then use those as guides to draw the rest.
- However, the program calculates \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), leading to \( 2 \times (2 + 2) = 8 \) segments, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve considering the optimal way to draw the squares such that the minimum number of segments are drawn with a ruler. This might involve drawing the maximum number of squares horizontally first and then vertically, or some other optimal strategy. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
