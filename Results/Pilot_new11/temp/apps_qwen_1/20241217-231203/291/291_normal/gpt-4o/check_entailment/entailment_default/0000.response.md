Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires minimizing the number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler. The given solution attempts to find a pattern in the number of segments needed by iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), but it does not accurately reflect the geometric constraints of the problem.

To draw \(n\) squares, Sofia needs to draw \(2n\) segments in total. The key is to determine how many of these segments she can draw using previously drawn segments as a guide. Specifically, for \(n\) squares, she needs to draw:

- 2 segments for the first square.
- For each additional square, she can use the existing segments as a guide to draw 2 new segments.

The formula to calculate the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is \(2 + 2(n-1) = 2n\). However, the provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it tries to find a pattern by iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), which is not necessary and does not yield the correct result for all cases.

For example, for \(n = 1\), the correct answer should be 2, but the code calculates a different value. Similarly, for \(n = 2\), the correct answer is 3, but the code calculates a different value.

Here is the correct implementation based on the problem description:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 * n

n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))
```

This implementation directly computes the correct result based on the problem statement.
