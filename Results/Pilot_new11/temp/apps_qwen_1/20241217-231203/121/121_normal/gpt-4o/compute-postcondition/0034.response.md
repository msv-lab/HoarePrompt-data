Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`, and for every key `char` in `counts`, the count of `char` is less than or equal to `target_count`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the `counts` dictionary.
- For each character, it checks if the count of that character is greater than `target_count`.
- If any character's count is greater than `target_count`, the loop prints `'==='` and returns immediately.
- If no character's count exceeds `target_count`, the loop completes its iterations without printing or returning anything.

Since the loop only prints and returns early if any character's count exceeds `target_count`, the final state of the program will be such that all character counts are less than or equal to `target_count`. This condition must hold true after all iterations of the loop.
