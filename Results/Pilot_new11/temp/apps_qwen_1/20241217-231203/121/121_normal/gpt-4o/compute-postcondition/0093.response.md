Postcondition: ***`result[i]` is a sequence of characters where each character `char` was added if and only if `counts[char]` was less than `target_count` at the time of addition. After executing the if statement, for each `char` that was added to `result[i]`, `counts[char]` is now greater than or equal to `target_count`, and no further additions occur for that `char` unless `counts[char]` decreases below `target_count` again.***
