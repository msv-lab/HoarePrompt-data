Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing the string representation of the new integer `n` and the string `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is either `target_count` or less than `target_count`, and `result` is a list of characters from the string `s` where each element is either the character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' (if its count in `s` was less than `target_count`) or remains `'?'` (if its count in `s` was `target_count` or more).***
