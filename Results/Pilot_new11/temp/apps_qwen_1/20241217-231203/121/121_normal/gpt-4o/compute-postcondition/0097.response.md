Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input. It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`. It then replaces all '?' in `s` with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' appears exactly `n/4` times. If it's impossible to achieve this due to insufficient counts, it prints '===' and returns `None`. After processing, it prints the modified string `s` and returns `None`. Potential edge cases include inputs where `n` is not divisible by 4, or the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` do not allow achieving the required distribution.**
