Postcondition: ***`i` is 2; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list containing the string representation of the new integer `n` and the string `s`; `target_count` is `n // 4`; `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is `target_count`; for the key `char`, the count of `char` is either `target_count` or less than `target_count`; `result` is a list of characters from the string `s` where the first element is either `char` (if `counts[char] < target_count`) or remains `'?'` (if `counts[char] >= target_count`). The second element of `result` is the next character in the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'} after the current `char`. The most internal loop or if statement has been exited.***
