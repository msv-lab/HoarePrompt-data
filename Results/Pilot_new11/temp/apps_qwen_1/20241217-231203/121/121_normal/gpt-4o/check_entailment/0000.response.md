Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are already equal but still contains '?' characters. For example, consider the input:

```
8
AACCGGTT
```

The program should output `AACCGGTT` since the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are already equal. However, the current implementation will still attempt to replace the '?' characters, which is unnecessary and not required by the problem description.

To fix this, the program should check if the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are already equal and do not exceed the target count before attempting to replace the '?' characters. If they are already equal, the program should directly print the string without modification.
