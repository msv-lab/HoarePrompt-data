You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input is read from stdin and the output is printed to stdout. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`. `n` is divisible by 4
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`, and for every key `char` in `counts`, the count of `char` is less than or equal to `target_count`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing the string representation of the new integer `n` and the string `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is exactly `target_count`, and `result` is a list of characters from the string `s` where each element is either the character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' (if its count in `s` was less than `target_count`) or remains `'?'` (if its count in `s` was `target_count` or more).
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, and in all cases, returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: None


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
