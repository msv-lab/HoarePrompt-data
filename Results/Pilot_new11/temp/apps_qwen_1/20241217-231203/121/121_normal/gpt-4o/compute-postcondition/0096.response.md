The function `func_1` does not accept any input parameters. Instead, it reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. There are four cases where the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, and in all cases, return `None`. 

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, and in all cases, returns `None`.**
