Output State: **`counts` is a non-empty iterable, `result[i]` contains a sequence of characters where each character `char` was added to `result[i]` if and only if `counts[char]` was less than `target_count` at the time of addition. For each `char` that was added to `result[i]`, `counts[char]` is now greater than or equal to `target_count`, and no further additions occur for that `char` unless `counts[char]` decreases below `target_count` again.**
