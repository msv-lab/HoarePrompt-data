The code `res += c` adds the character `c` to the end of the string `res`. Given that `nc` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and `c` is the next character in the string `s` and is not '?', the variable `res` is initialized as an empty string before this line of code. After executing `res += c`, the value of `res` becomes the concatenation of the empty string and `c`, which is just `c`.

Output State: **`nc` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', `c` is the next character in the string `s` and is not '?', `res` is `c`**
