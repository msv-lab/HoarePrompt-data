Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly processes the input string `s` of length `n`, counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', adjusts these counts to ensure each character appears approximately `n // 4` times, and constructs a new string by replacing all '?' characters accordingly. The logic to validate the adjusted counts and print '===' if necessary is also correctly implemented. The output hints further confirm that the program behaves as expected for various scenarios, including edge cases like when `n` is 4. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is logically sound.
