Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where it is impossible to decode the genome such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` times. Specifically, if the total count of nucleotides other than '?' cannot be evenly distributed among the four types, the program will incorrectly attempt to adjust the counts and print '===' instead of providing a valid decoded genome or indicating impossibility more clearly.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
AG?C??CT?
```
Here, the counts are:
- A: 1
- C: 2
- G: 0
- T: 2
- ? : 3

To have each type appear `8 // 4 = 2` times, we need:
- A: 1 (needs 1 more)
- C: 0 (needs 2 more)
- G: 0 (needs 2 more)
- T: 2 (exceeds by 1)

This is impossible to achieve, yet the current implementation will still attempt to distribute the counts and print '==='.

To handle this correctly, you would need to check if the counts can be evenly distributed before attempting to construct the result. If not, you should print '===' to indicate the impossibility.
