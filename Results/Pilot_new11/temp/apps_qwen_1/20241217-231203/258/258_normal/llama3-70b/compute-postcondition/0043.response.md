Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` has iterated through the range \([-1000, 1000]\); `ans` is the minimum value of the \(K\)-th smallest element from all the `times` lists generated during the loop iterations; `times` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
