According to the code, the loop iterates over `y` from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000 and is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `times` is a sorted list of two elements resulting from `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`, and `ans` is -999.

Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `y` must have been its maximum value of 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to start from -1000 again, but since the range is inclusive, it will continue iterating until 1000.

Here's the step-by-step adjustment of the states:

- `x` remains unchanged at -999.
- `y` starts from -1000.
- The condition for `times` and `ans` will be re-evaluated with the new value of `y`.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `times` is a sorted list of two elements resulting from `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, `ans` is -999**
