Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`.
- `y` must iterate through the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the K-th smallest element from the `times` list.
- `times` is sorted.

### Given Loop
```python
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `y` in the range from \(-1000\) to \(1000\), inclusive. This means there are \(2001\) iterations in total.

2. **Current Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over all values in the range \([-1000, 1000]\) inclusively, each value of `y` will be processed exactly once.

3. **State Transition**:
   - `x` remains unchanged within this loop because the loop only iterates over `y` and does not affect `x`.
   - `y` increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - `ans` is updated based on the K-th smallest element from the `times` list in each iteration, but the exact value of `ans` is not specified in the problem. It is updated in each iteration, but the exact value before the update is not given.
   - `times` is sorted, so it remains sorted throughout the loop.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `y` starts from \(-1000\) and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the first iteration, `y` is \(-999\).
- For the next iteration, `y` will be \(-998\).

### Final State
Given that `y` is \(-999\) at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `y` will be \(-998\). All other states remain unchanged as they do not depend on `y`.

**Final State:**
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `y` is \(-998\).
- `ans` is updated based on the K-th smallest element from the `times` list in each iteration, but the exact value before the update is not given.
- `times` remains sorted.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`; `y` is \(-998\); `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the K-th smallest element from the `times` list; `times` is sorted**.
