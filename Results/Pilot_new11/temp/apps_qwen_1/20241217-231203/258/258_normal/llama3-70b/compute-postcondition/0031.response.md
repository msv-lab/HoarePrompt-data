The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `times`. But we know that `times` will be assigned the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` must be within the range -1000 to 1000, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`**
