Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible integer coordinates within the range \([-1000, 1000]\) for both \(X\) and \(Y\). However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the optimal point for placing the heat source might not be at an integer coordinate. Since the constraints allow for real number coordinates, the program may miss the optimal solution by only considering integer points.

For instance, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal point to place the heat source is \((-0.2, 0)\), as mentioned in the sample output. The program, however, would only check integer points, such as \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), etc., and might miss this optimal solution.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated method, such as using optimization techniques like gradient descent or a more comprehensive search algorithm that considers real number coordinates, would be necessary.
