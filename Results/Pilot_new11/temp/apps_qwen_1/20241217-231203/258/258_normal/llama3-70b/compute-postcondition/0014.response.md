Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Given Code and Initial State:
- **Initial State**:
  - `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `K` and `N` are integers such that \(1 \leq N \leq 60\) and \(1 \leq K \leq N\).
  - `c_i` are integers in the range \([1, 100]\).
  - `x_i` and `y_i` are integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - Each \((x_i, y_i)\) is unique.
  - `ans` is positive infinity.

- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for y in range(-1000, 1001):
      times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
      times.sort()
      ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` from `-1000` to `1000` inclusive.
   - For each `y`, the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, which presumably returns a list of times (assuming it returns a list of two integers).
   - This list is sorted, and the `K-th` smallest element (considering 0-based indexing) is used to update `ans`.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `x` and `y` are not modified inside the loop.
   - `times` is updated with the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.
   - `ans` is updated with the minimum value between its current value and the `K-th` smallest element of `times`.

### Output States After Few Iterations:
- **After 1st Iteration**:
  - `x` remains unchanged.
  - `y` takes the first value from the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `times` is a sorted list of two integers.
  - `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the `K-th` smallest element of `times`.

- **After 2nd Iteration**:
  - `x` remains unchanged.
  - `y` takes the second value from the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `times` is a sorted list of two integers.
  - `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the `K-th` smallest element of `times`.

- **After 3rd Iteration**:
  - `x` remains unchanged.
  - `y` takes the third value from the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `times` is a sorted list of two integers.
  - `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the `K-th` smallest element of `times`.

### Final State Analysis:
- Since the loop iterates over all possible values of `y` from `-1000` to `1000`, the `times` list will be updated multiple times with different pairs of integers.
- The `ans` variable will be updated with the minimum of the `K-th` smallest elements from all these lists.
- `x` and `y` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the following should hold true:
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged and are still integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `ans` is the minimum value of the `K-th` smallest element from all the `times` lists generated during the loop iterations.

### Final Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: **x is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], y is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], ans is the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations.**
