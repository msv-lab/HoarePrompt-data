Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list containing the maximum possible values of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for all `y` in the range -1000 to 1000, `ans` is the minimum of the last element of `times` for all iterations of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`x` is -999:** The variable `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop only increments `y` and uses `x` as an input to the function `func_2`.
- **`y` is within the range -1000 to 1000:** The variable `y` starts at -1000 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1000. Thus, after the loop completes, `y` will be 1000.
- **`times` is a sorted list containing the maximum possible values of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for all `y` in the range -1000 to 1000:** Since `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called for every `y` in the range, and the list is sorted, `times` will contain the values returned by `func_2` for each `y`. The final value of `times` will be the sorted list of these values.
- **`ans` is the minimum of the last element of `times` for all iterations of the loop:** Each iteration updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and the last element of `times`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `ans` will be the smallest value among the last elements of `times` for each `y` in the range -1000 to 1000.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `y` does not reach any value in the range -1000 to 1000), then:
- `x` remains -999.
- `y` remains -1000 (or the starting value if the loop never executes).
- `times` would be an empty list.
- `ans` remains -999.
