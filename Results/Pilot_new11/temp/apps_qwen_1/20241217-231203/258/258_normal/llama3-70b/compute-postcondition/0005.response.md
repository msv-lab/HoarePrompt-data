The code assigns the value of `times[K - 1]` to `ans` if `times[K - 1]` is smaller than the current value of `ans`. However, since `ans` is not defined before this line, we assume `ans` starts with a very large value (infinity) or the maximum possible integer value for comparison. The value of `times` and its index `K` are not specified, so we consider `times` as a sorted list of two integers, say `a` and `b` (where `a <= b`). 

Given this, the impact of the code on the program is that `ans` is updated to be the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `y` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range [-1000, 1000], `ans` is the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.**
