`d2` is assigned the value `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given that `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can substitute these expressions into the equation for `d2`.

Therefore, `d2` becomes `((x1 - x2) / 2) ** 2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2) ** 2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) ** 2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2) ** 2`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d` is less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
