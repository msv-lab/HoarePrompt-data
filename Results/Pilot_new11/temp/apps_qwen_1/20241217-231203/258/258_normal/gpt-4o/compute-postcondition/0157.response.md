The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, the given code snippet does not indicate which loop this statement belongs to, but it implies that the loop is being exited temporarily rather than breaking out completely. Since no variables are modified within the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), and the current value of `d * d2` is greater than `d2`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
