The code snippet updates the value of `dy` to be `(y1 - y2) / 2`. According to the initial state, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]` and `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`. Therefore, `dy` is now updated to be `(meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2`, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` retains its value.**
