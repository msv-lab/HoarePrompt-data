Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads the input and splits it into components. It then processes the input to extract the necessary data (coordinates and hardness of the meat pieces) into a list of tuples. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The `func_2` function sets up a binary search to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The search range is from `0` to `1000000000.0` (a very large number, ensuring the upper bound is sufficient for the constraints). The binary search iteratively narrows down the search range until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-07`. 

3. **Binary Search Functionality**:
   - For each midpoint (`mid`) in the binary search, the function `func_1` is called to check if `K` or more pieces of meat can be ready within `mid` seconds. The function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions by considering the distances and hardness of the meat pieces. If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the current midpoint (`mid`) is a feasible solution, so the upper bound (`high`) is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, the lower bound (`low`) is updated to `mid`.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The binary search ensures that the minimum time is found accurately within the specified precision. The `func_2` function returns the optimal time, which is stored in `high`.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed with a precision of six decimal places, as specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring that it finds the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready, meeting all constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
