Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is the last index that was processed in the loop, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `meats`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `meats`, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index `j` in `meats`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\), `mx` is `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}` if \(d * d2 > d2\), otherwise `mx` remains as it was before, `my` is \((y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}\), `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first one, and `count` is less than `K`. If the loop does not execute, `i` is `N-1`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are undefined.**
