The code calculates `d2` as `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given the initial state, `dx` and `dy` are defined as follows:
- `dx` is `(meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]) / 2`
- `dy` is `(meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]) / 2`

Thus, `d2` is calculated as:
\[ d2 = \left(\frac{meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]}{2}\right)^2 \]

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `j` is `i_end`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false, `x1` is `meats[i_end - 1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i_end - 1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i_end - 1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(meats[i_end - 1][0] + meats[j][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]) / 2`, `dy` is `(meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]) / 2`, `d2` is `((meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]) / 2)^2 + ((meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]) / 2)^2`, `mx`, `my` are unchanged, `count` is less than `K`.**
