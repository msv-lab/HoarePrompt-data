The code calculates `d` as `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` do not change. The state of other variables remains unaffected. 

The calculation simplifies to:
\[ d = c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T = (c1 - c2) \cdot T \]

Since the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `c1` must be greater than or equal to `c2`. Therefore, `c1 - c2` is non-negative, making `d` non-negative.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged.**
