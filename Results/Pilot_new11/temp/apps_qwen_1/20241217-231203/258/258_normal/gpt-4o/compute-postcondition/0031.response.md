Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 2; `meats` is a list of tuples; `i` is 0; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `x2` is now `x1`, `y2` is now `y1`, `c2` is now `c1`, `cx` is `x1`, `cy` is `y1`, `dx` is `0`, `dy` is `0`, `d2` is `0`, `mx` is `x1`, `my` is `y1`, `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first and second one, and `count` is less than `K`. Otherwise, `x2` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; `y2` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; `c2` is now the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`; `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\), `mx` is `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}` if \(d * d2 > d2\), otherwise `mx` remains as it was before; `my` is \((y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}\); `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first and second one, and `count` is less than `K`.***
