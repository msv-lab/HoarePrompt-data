Let's analyze the given Python code step by step:

1. The initial state includes several variables with specific conditions and values:
   - `i` is `i_end - 1`
   - `N` is greater than `i_end`
   - The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, meaning `c1 * T >= c2 * T`
   - `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged
   - `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
   - `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)
   - `mx = cx + \frac{dy \cdot \sqrt{(dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4) \cdot (d - 1)}}{dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4}`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
   ```

3. Let's break down the expression for `my`:
   - `d2` is already defined as \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)
   - `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to \(d2 * d - d^2\)
   - The term \(\math.sqrt(d2 * d - d^2)\) represents the square root of \(d2 * d - d^2\)
   - Dividing by `d2` gives \(\frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2}\)

Therefore, the new value of `my` is:
   - `my = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2}`

Since no other variables are affected, the updated values for the variables are:
- `i` is still `i_end - 1`
- `N` is still greater than `i_end`
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false, so `c1 * T >= c2 * T`
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx` remain unchanged

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx` remain unchanged, `my = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2}`**
