Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is never true, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` remain unchanged, `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` and is less than `K`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K` at any point, the function returns `True`; otherwise, the function returns `None`.**
