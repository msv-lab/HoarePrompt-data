Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where \( K = 0 \). According to the problem description, if \( K = 0 \), the program should theoretically return a value that satisfies the condition, but the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will return `False` for \( K = 0 \) because the loop in `func_1` will not execute any meaningful operations. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for all potential cases.
