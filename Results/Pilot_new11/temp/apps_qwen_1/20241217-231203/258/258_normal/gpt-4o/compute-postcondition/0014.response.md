The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `c`. Given the initial state, `index` is 8, so `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[10]`. The value of `data[10]` is a string, which is converted to an integer and assigned to `c`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:
- The initial value of `index` is 8.
- The value of `data[10]` is a string (let's call this string `str_value`).
- `c` is assigned the integer value of `str_value`.

Therefore, the updated state includes:
- `c` is now the integer value of `data[10]`.
- All other variables (`data`, `N`, `meats`, `index`, `x`, `y`, `c`) retain their previous values except `c`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
