The code `c = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `c`. Given that `index` is 12, `index + 2` is 14. So, `c` is assigned the integer value of `data[14]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` must be greater than 1, `meats` is a list containing two identical tuples, each with elements that are integers derived from `data[8]`, `data[9]`, and `data[10]`, `index` is 12, `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[13]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[14]`**
