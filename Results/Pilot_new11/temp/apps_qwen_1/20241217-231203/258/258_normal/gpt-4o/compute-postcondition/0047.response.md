Postcondition: ***`d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\), `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `N` is at least 2, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is updated to the next index, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, and `y2` are defined as per the precondition, `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `mx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2} + \frac{y1 - y2}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `my` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - \frac{(x1 - x2)}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `count` is the sum of `c * \mathbf{math.sqrt((mx - x1)^2 + (my - y1)^2)}` for all tuples from index `i` to `i + N - 1`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.***
