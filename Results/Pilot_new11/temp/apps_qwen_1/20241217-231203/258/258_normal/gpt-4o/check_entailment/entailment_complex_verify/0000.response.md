Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time**: The `func_1` function incorrectly calculates the time required for the meat to be ready. It compares the scaled hardness values instead of calculating the Euclidean distance from the heat source to the meat pieces. This is evident in the line `if c1 * T < c2 * T:` which should be irrelevant to the time calculation.

2. **Logical Flaw in `func_1`**: The logic inside `func_1` for checking if the condition is met is flawed. The function should check if the distance from the heat source to each meat piece is less than or equal to `T / c`, but it currently does not do this correctly. The annotated code confirms that the function is trying to find a geometric configuration, but the logic for determining this configuration is incorrect.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function performs a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_1`, which means the binary search might not converge to the correct solution.

4. **Overall Program Flow**: The `func_3` function correctly reads the input and calls the other functions, but the core logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **False**.
