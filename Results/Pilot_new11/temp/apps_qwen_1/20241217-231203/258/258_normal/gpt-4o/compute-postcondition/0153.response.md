`dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The value of `x1` and `x2` remains unchanged. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
