Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate and is supported by the detailed analysis provided in the annotations. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The `func_1` function attempts to find a midpoint between pairs of meat pieces and checks if the distance from these midpoints would allow K or more pieces to be ready within time T. This is a flawed approach because it does not consider the optimal global position for the heat source. Instead, it locally compares pairs of meat pieces, which is not sufficient to find the minimal time required for K pieces to be ready.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search to find the minimum time required. However, it relies on `func_1` to determine the feasibility of a given time T. Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` cannot produce the correct result.

3. **Edge Cases and Assumptions**: The program makes several implicit assumptions and does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, it does not handle the case where K is 0 or the list of meat pieces is empty. These issues further contribute to the incorrectness of the program.

Given these points, the program does not meet the problem description and the annotations confirm the original assessment. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
