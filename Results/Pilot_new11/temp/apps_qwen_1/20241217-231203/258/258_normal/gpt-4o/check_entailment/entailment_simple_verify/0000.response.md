Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The `func_1` function compares the hardness values of meat pieces using `c1 * T < c2 * T`. This comparison does not correctly reflect the distance calculation required for determining if the meat pieces will be ready.
   - The function should instead check if the distance from each meat piece to the hypothetical heat source is less than or equal to `T / c_i`. The current logic is flawed and does not correctly implement this.

2. **Binary Search Implementation in `func_2`**:
   - The `func_2` function uses `func_1` to perform a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. Since `func_1` is flawed, the binary search might not converge to the correct solution.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the distance from the hypothetical heat source to each meat piece using the formula `c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T`. However, the logic inside `func_1` for checking if the condition is met is incorrect because it does not properly account for the distance calculation.

Based on these observations, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **False**.
