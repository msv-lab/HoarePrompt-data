Postcondition: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`. The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true.**
