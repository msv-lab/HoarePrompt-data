Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to implement a binary search approach to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time**: The `func_1` function checks if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready. It does this by comparing the distances between pairs of meat pieces, but it does not consider the correct formula for calculating the time. Specifically, the function incorrectly uses the difference in hardness values to determine if the condition is met.

2. **Logical Flaw in `func_1`**: The logic inside `func_1` for checking if the condition is met is flawed. It uses the formula `c1 * T - c2 * T` to decide the order of meat pieces, which does not reflect the actual distance calculation required. Instead, it should be checking if the distance from the heat source to each piece of meat is less than or equal to `T / c`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function performs a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_1`, which means the binary search might not converge to the correct solution.

4. **Input Parsing and Data Structure**: The `func_3` function parses the input correctly, but the overall logic is flawed due to the issues mentioned above.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the distance from each meat piece to the heat source and check if the time required for each piece is less than or equal to the given time `T`. The `func_1` function should be revised to properly compare distances and the binary search implementation should be corrected to use the correct logic.
