`x2` and `y2` are assigned the second and third elements of `meats[j]`, respectively, and `c2` is assigned the fourth element of `meats[j]`. The values of the other variables are not directly affected by this code snippet.

- The value of `dx` is still \((x1 - x2) / 2\).
- The value of `dy` is still \((y1 - y2) / 2\).
- The value of `d2` is still \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\).
- The value of `mx` is still \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\).
- The value of `my` is still \(cy - \sqrt{d}\).
- The value of `j` is now `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, and `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`**.
