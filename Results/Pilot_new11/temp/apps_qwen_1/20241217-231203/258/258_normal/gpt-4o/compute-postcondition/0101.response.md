The code calculates `d` as `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Given the condition `if c1 * T < c2 * T` does not change any variable states, the calculation will be performed regardless of the condition. So, `d` will be assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
