`x2` and `y2` are updated to the values from the `meats` list at index `j`, and `c2` is also updated to the corresponding value from the `meats` list at the same index. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\), `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `N` is at least 2, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the values from the `meats` list at index `i`, `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `mx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2} + \frac{y1 - y2}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `my` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - \frac{(x1 - x2)}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `count` is the sum of `c * \mathbf{math.sqrt((mx - x1)^2 + (my - y1)^2)}` for all tuples from index `i` to `i + N - 1`; `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values from the `meats` list at index `j`, and `c2` is updated to the corresponding value from the `meats` list at the same index.**
