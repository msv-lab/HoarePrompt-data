The code snippet `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` updates the value of `dy` to be `(y1 - y2) / 2`. According to the initial state, `dy` was already defined as `((x1 - x2) / 2)`. Now, `dy` is reassigned to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is \((x2 + x1) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)**
