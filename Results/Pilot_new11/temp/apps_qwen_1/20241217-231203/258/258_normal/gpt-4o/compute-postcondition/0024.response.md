The code `result = func_2(N, K, meats)` calls the function `func_2` with parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its implementation details are not available. Therefore, the only variables that are affected by this line of code are `result`, which is assigned the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and the other variables (`data`, `N`, `meats`, `index`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is unknown, the best we can say is that `result` will hold the return value of the function, and the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples each represented as `(x, y, c)`, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**
