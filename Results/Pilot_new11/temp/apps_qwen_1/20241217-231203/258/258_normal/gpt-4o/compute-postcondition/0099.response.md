The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. Let's go through this step by step:

1. Initially, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are \((x2 - x1) / 2\), \((y2 - y1) / 2\), and \(\text{d2} = ((x1 - x2) / 2)\).
2. After swapping, `x1` becomes `x2`, `y1` becomes `y2`, and `c1` becomes `c2`.
3. The values of `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, and `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`**.
