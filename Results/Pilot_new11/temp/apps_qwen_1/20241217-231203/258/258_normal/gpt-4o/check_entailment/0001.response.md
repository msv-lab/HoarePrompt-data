Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not designed to find the optimal position for the heat source. Instead, it attempts to compare pairs of meat pieces and calculate potential positions, which is not the correct approach.

The main issue lies in the logic of `func_1`, where it tries to find a midpoint between pairs of meat pieces and checks if the distance from these midpoints would allow K or more pieces to be ready within time T. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal position globally but rather locally compares pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a binary search approach (`func_2`) combined with a feasibility check (`func_1`) to determine the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is not suitable for this purpose.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, such as using a ternary search or other optimization techniques to find the optimal position for the heat source that minimizes the time required for K pieces of meat to be ready.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
