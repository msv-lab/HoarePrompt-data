Postcondition: ***`i` is `i`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `j` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 1`, `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains true, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2\). If \(d \times d2 > d2\), then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
