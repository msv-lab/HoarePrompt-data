The given code snippet swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. According to the initial state, we know the following:

- `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`
- `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`
- `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`
- `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`
- `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`

The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true, which means `c1 < c2`.

After executing the line of code:

```python
x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1
```

The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be swapped with the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively.

Therefore, the updated values will be:

- `x1` is now the first element of `meats[j]`, which is `x2`
- `y1` is now the second element of `meats[j]`, which is `y2`
- `c1` is now the third element of `meats[j]`, which is `c2`
- `x2` is now the first element of `meats[i]`, which is `x1`
- `y2` is now the second element of `meats[i]`, which is `y1`
- `c2` is now the third element of `meats[i]`, which is `c1`

The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is no longer true because `c1` and `c2` have swapped values, and since `c1 < c2` was initially true, swapping them would make `c2 < c1`, which is false.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, `x1` is a first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is a second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is a third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is a first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is a second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is a third element of `meats[i]`, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is now false.**
