Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `i` is the last index that was processed in the loop.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the first, second, and third elements of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`.
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the first, second, and third elements of the tuple at index `j` in `meats`.
- `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\).
- `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\).
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\).
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\).
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\).
- `d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\).
- `mx` is `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}` if \(d * d2 > d2\), otherwise `mx` remains as it was before.
- `my` is \((y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}\).
- `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first one.
- `count` is less than `K`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(N)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `N-1`. 

2. **State Transition:**
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 from its current value.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, other variables like `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are not directly modified by the loop itself.
   - However, the values of these variables depend on the `i` and `j` indices, which are being updated by the loop.

4. **New State After Incrementing `i`:**
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - If `i + 1 < N`, the loop can continue.
   - Otherwise, if `i + 1 = N`, the loop stops, and `i` remains `N-1`.

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain the same unless the loop body updates them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are the same as before, and `count` is less than `K` if `i + 1 < N`**.
