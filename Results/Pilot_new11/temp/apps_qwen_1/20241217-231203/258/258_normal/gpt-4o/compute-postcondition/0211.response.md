Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat, a positive integer `K`, and an integer `T`. The function iterates over all pairs of meat pieces in the list and checks if there exists a pair of meat pieces such that when their hardnesses are scaled by `T`, the distance between their centroids, adjusted by a geometric factor, results in a configuration where the number of meat pieces within a circle of radius `T` centered at the new centroid is at least `K`.

If such a configuration is found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the list `meats` is non-empty. If `meats` is empty, the function will enter the for loop and immediately exit without performing any calculations, effectively returning `False`.
- The function does not handle the case where `K` is 0. In such a scenario, the function would always return `True` because any pair of meat pieces would satisfy the condition if `K` is 0.
- The function does not explicitly check if the calculated distance `d` is valid (i.e., non-negative). However, since `d` is derived from the difference in scaled hardnesses, and the function continues only if `d < 0`, this check is implicitly handled.
- The function does not provide any feedback on which pair of meat pieces satisfies the condition. It only returns a boolean indicating whether such a pair exists.

In summary, the function checks for a specific geometric configuration among pairs of meat pieces and returns `True` if such a configuration meets the specified criteria, otherwise it returns `False`.**
