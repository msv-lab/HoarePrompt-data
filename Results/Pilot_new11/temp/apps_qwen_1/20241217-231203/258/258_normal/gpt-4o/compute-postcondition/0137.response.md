Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `count`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `mx`, and `my` retain their values from the precondition. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function does not change any values. Otherwise, no specific changes are mentioned in the else part, so the values remain unchanged as well.***
