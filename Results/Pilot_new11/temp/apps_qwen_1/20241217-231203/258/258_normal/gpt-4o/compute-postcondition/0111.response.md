Postcondition: ***`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T / (c1 * c2)\), `cx` is \((x2 + x1) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\). If \(d * d2 > d2\), then `d2` remains \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\). Otherwise, `d2` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of all the variables, indicating that they remain unchanged in both the if and else branches, except for the value of `d2`, which is explicitly updated in the if branch and remains unchanged in the else branch.
