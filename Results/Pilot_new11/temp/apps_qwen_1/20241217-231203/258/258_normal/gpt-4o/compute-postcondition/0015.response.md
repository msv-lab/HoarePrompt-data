`meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`. The code appends another tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. Given that `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, and `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`, the new tuple added to `meats` is `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`.

The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing two tuples `[(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10])), (int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing two tuples `[(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10])), (int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
