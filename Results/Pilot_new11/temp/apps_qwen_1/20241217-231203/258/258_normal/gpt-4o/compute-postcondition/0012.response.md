`x` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 8, `x` becomes the integer value of `data[8]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
