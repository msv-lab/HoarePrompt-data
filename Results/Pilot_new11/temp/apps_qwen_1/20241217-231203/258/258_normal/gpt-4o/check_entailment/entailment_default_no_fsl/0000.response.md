Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `K` is 0. According to the problem description, if `K` is 0, the function should still return the minimum time to have 0 or more pieces of meat ready, which is 0. However, the current implementation of `func_2` will always return a non-zero value because it uses binary search to find the largest value such that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to `False`. When `K` is 0, `func_1` will always return `True` for any `T` because it only checks if the number of meat pieces within a certain distance is at least `K`, and `K` being 0 means any `T` is valid. Therefore, the binary search will not converge to 0, leading to an incorrect result for `K = 0`.
