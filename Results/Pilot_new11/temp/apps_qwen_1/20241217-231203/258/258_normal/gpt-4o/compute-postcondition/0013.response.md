The code assigns the value of `int(data[index + 1])` to `y`. Given the initial state, `index` is 8, so `y` is assigned the integer value of `data[9]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
