The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `x` after converting it to an integer. Since `index` is 2, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
