The code appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The previous value of `meats` was a list containing two identical tuples derived from `data[8]`, `data[9]`, and `data[10]`. After appending, `meats` will now contain three tuples.

- `data` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `meats` now contains `[tuple_from_data_8_to_10, tuple_from_data_8_to_10, (x, y, c)]`.
- `index` remains unchanged.
- `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` must be greater than 1, `meats` is a list containing [tuple_from_data_8_to_10, tuple_from_data_8_to_10, (x, y, c)], `index` is 12, `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[13]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[14]`.**
