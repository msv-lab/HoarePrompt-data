`y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 2, this means `y` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`. The value of `data[2]` is already known to be the integer value `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
