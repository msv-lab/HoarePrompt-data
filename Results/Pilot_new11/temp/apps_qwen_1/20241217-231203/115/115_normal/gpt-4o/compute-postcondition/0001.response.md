The code initializes a new 2D list `B` with dimensions `n` by `m`, where each element is set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, or `operations`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of size n by m where each element is 0.**
