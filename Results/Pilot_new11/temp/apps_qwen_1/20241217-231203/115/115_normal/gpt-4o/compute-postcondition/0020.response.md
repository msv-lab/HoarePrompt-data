The code assigns the value 1 to the elements B[i][j], B[i][j + 1], B[i + 1][j], and B[i + 1][j + 1]. Given the initial state, these elements were previously 1, so they remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices within the list such that the submatrix defined by A[i][j], A[i][j+1], A[i+1][j], and A[i+1][j+1] all equal 1; `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
