Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is at least 1.
- `i` is an index in the 2D array.
- `j` is `m - 1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from 0 to `m - 2`).

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `j` starts at `m - 1` (end of the range).

3. **First Iteration**:
   - At the start of the first iteration, `j` would be `m - 2`.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Each iteration decreases `j` by 1 until `j` becomes 0.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration to occur, `j` must decrease to 0.

6. **Final Value Before Next Iteration**:
   - Before the next iteration starts, `j` should be 0.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same (a positive integer between 2 and 50 inclusive).
- `m` remains the same (at least 1).
- `i` remains the same (an index in the 2D array).
- `j` must be 0 for the next iteration to occur.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, `j` is 0**.
