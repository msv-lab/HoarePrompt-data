According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range specified by `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range `[0, m-1]` and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j` must be incremented by 1.
2. The new value of `j` must still be within the range `[0, m-1]`.
3. The condition `A[i][j] == B[i][j]` must hold true for the new value of `j`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `j` will be incremented from its current value, so if it was `j_end`, the new value will be `j_end + 1`.
- To ensure `j` is still within the range, `j_end + 1` must be less than or equal to `m-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is in the range [0, m-2], A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j]**.

This means `j` is now in the range `[0, m-2]` because the next value of `j` would be `m-1`, but we need to check the condition before updating `j`.
