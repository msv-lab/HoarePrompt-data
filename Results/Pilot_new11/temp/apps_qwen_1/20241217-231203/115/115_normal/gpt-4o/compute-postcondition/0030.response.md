Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 1. If the conditions `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met, then `B[i][1]` is set to 1, `B[i][2]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][1]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][2]` is set to 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, the values of `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.***
