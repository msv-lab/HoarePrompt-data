Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is in the range [0, `n-1`], `j` is less than `m`, and `m` must be at least 1. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value.***
