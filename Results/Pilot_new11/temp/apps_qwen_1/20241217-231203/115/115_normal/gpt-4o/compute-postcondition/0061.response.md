Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
- `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0.
- `operations` is a list of tuples.
- `i` is in the range [0, `n-2`].
- `j` is in the range [0, `m-1`].

### For Loop:
The for loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop will execute if `j` is in the range [0, `m-1`].
   - Therefore, `j` must be initialized to a value within this range.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - The range of `j` depends on `m`.
   - Since `m` is already defined as a positive integer between 2 and 50, we do not need to adjust its value.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, and `i` do not affect the execution of the loop directly.
   - These variables remain unchanged and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure it falls within the range [0, `m-1`]. 

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is in the range [0, `m-1`]**
