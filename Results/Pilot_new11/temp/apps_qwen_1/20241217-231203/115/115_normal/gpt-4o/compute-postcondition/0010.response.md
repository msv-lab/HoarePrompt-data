The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given the initial conditions, `j` is `m - 1`. Therefore, the tuple added to `operations` is `(i + 1, m)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, `j` is `m - 1`, there exists a cell `A[i][j]` in a 2D array `A` such that `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` and `(i + 1, m)`**.
