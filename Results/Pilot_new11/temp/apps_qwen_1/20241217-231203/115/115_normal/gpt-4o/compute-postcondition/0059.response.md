Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is in the range [0, `n-1`], `j` is in the range [0, `m-1`]. For all `i` in the range [0, `n-1`] and `j` in the range [0, `m-1`], `A[i][j] == B[i][j]`. If there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `A[i][j] != B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `n` and `m`:** These remain unchanged because the loop only iterates over `j` and does not modify `n` or `m`.
- **Variables `A` and `B`:** The loop checks each element `A[i][j]` against `B[i][j]`. If any element does not match, the function returns -1 immediately. If all elements match, the function continues without returning a value.
- **Variable `i`:** This index runs through each row of the matrix `A` and `B`, so it needs to be in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- **Variable `j`:** This index runs through each column of the matrix `A` and `B`, so it needs to be in the range `[0, m-1]`.
- **Condition for Returning -1:** The loop checks if `A[i][j] != B[i][j]`. If this condition is true for any `(i, j)`, the function returns -1. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it means all elements are equal, and the function continues without returning a value.

Thus, after the loop executes, all elements of `A` and `B` at the same indices must be equal. If any mismatch is found, the function returns -1.
