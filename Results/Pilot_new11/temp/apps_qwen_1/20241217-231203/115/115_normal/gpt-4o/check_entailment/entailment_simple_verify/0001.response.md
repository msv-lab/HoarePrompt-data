Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided annotated version clarifies the states of the program and confirms that the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to set a `2x2` submatrix in `B` to `1` whenever the corresponding `2x2` submatrix in `A` is all `1`s. However, this approach does not account for overlapping `2x2` submatrices, which can lead to incorrect transformations of `B`.

Consider the input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to make `B` equal to `A` by performing operations on `2x2` submatrices of `B`. The program will attempt to set the `2x2` submatrix starting at `(0, 0)` to `[1, 1; 1, 1]`, but this operation would also affect the `(1, 1)` element, which should remain `0`. Therefore, the program cannot correctly transform `B` into `A` in this case, leading to incorrect results.

The annotated version reinforces the fact that the program's logic does not handle the necessary checks to ensure that setting one `2x2` submatrix does not interfere with setting another `2x2` submatrix if they overlap. Hence, the program fails to meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
