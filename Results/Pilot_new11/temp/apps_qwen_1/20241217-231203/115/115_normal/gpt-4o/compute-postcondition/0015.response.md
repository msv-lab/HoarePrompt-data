Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `B[i + 1][0]`, and `B[i + 1][1]` are set to 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
