Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are the dimensions of a 2D list `A` containing only 0s and 1s. The function aims to identify and mark certain submatrices within `A` where all four corners are 1s, creating a new 2D list `B` of the same size as `A` where these marked submatrices are also set to 1s. It records the coordinates of these submatrices in a list called `operations`. After processing, the function checks if `A` and `B` are identical; if not, it returns -1 indicating that the two matrices do not match. If they match, the function prints the number of operations performed and the coordinates of the operations. The function can return -1 under various conditions, including when the matrices do not match or when no valid submatrices are found.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is less than 2, though the initial condition states `2 <= n, m <= 50`.
- The function does not explicitly check if the submatrices identified are within the bounds of `A`.
- The function does not provide any return value other than -1 when conditions are met, even though the code seems to indicate it should print and return some information.
- There are no return statements outside of the conditions that return -1, which might imply that in cases where no -1 is returned, the function implicitly returns 0. However, the return postconditions only mention -1, suggesting the function should consistently return -1 unless otherwise specified.
