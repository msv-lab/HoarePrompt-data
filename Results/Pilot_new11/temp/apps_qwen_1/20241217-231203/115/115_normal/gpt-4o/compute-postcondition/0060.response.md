According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
- `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0.
- `operations` is a list of tuples.
- `i` is in the range [0, `n-1`].
- `j` is in the range [0, `m-1`].
- For all `i` in the range [0, `n-1`] and `j` in the range [0, `m-1`], `A[i][j] == B[i][j]`.
- If there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `A[i][j] != B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider:
1. The current value of `i` must be increased by 1.
2. The condition for the loop to continue depends on `i` being less than `n`.

Since the loop variable `i` is currently within the range [0, `n-1`], the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, this new value of `i` must still be within the range [0, `n-1`].

Given that `i` was in the range [0, `n-1`], the next value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) will still be in the range [0, `n-1`] as long as `i < n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < n-1`.

Since no specific operation is mentioned in the loop body that would affect `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, or `operations`, these values remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is increased by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is in the range [0, `n-2`], `j` is in the range [0, `m-1`]**.
