The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and the values of the cells in the 2D array `A` and `B` are not changed. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the tuple to the list `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, there exists a cell `A[i][j]` in a 2D array `A` such that the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`; `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.
