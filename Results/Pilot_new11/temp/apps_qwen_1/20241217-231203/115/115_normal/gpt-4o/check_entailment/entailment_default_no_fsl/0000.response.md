Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code only marks submatrices where all four corners are 1s, but it does not handle the general case where the submatrix can be placed anywhere within the larger matrix. Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 0
0 1 0
```

For this input, the correct sequence of operations to transform matrix `B` into matrix `A` would involve marking the submatrix starting at `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` as follows:
- Mark the submatrix starting at `(0, 0)` which involves setting `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]` to 1.
- Mark the submatrix starting at `(1, 1)` which involves setting `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]` to 1.

However, the provided code will only mark the first occurrence of a valid `2x2` submatrix where all four corners are 1s, and it will miss marking the second valid submatrix. As a result, the code will fail to correctly transform matrix `B` into matrix `A` for this and similar inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
