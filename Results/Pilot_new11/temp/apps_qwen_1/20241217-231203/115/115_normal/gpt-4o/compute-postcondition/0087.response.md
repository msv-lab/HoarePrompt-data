The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first and second elements of the first tuple in the `operations` list. The variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this line of code, and the states of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` remain unchanged.

Since the `operations` list contains at least one element, the first element of `operations` is a tuple containing at least two elements, which are printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed.**
