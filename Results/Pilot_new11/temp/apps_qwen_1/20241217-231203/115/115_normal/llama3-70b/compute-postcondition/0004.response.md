Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The for loop is iterating over the range from `0` to `m - 1`. This means the loop will run for each value of `j` starting from `0` up to `m - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Loop Variables**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts at `0`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `m` is the second input integer.
   - `A` is an `n Ã— m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is an empty list.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must satisfy `0 <= j < m - 1`.
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is `0`, so we need to ensure that `m - 1 > 0` (which implies `m > 1`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at `0`, the loop can execute if `m > 1`.
   - The matrix `A` and the list `ops` do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is `0`.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0**.
