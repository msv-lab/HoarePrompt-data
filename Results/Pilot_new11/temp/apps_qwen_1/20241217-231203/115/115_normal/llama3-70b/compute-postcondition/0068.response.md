The code prints the first two elements of the list `op`. However, the values of the variables `m`, `ops`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the only change is that the first two elements of `op` are printed.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least two elements, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`, and the first two elements of `op` are printed.**
