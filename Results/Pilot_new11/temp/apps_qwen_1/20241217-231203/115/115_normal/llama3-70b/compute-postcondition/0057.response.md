The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. However, the initial state does not include the definition of `ops` and the values of `i`. Given the constraints, we know that if the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met, no change occurs in the variables `m`, `j`, `i`, and `A`. Since these conditions are not specified as being true or false, they remain unchanged.

The only change is that the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to the list `ops`. Therefore, the output state includes this new information.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 2; `ops` contains the tuple (`i` + 1, `j` + 1)**
