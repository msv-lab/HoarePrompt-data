Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, then no change is made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the variables remain as they were initially: `m > 1` and `j = 1`.***
