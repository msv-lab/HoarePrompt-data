To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

Given Information:
- `m` must still be greater than 1.
- `ops` remains the same.
- `j` is initially set to `m - 2`.
- `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.

The loop is:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m - 1)` will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.
2. **Initial State of `j`**: `j` is set to `m - 2`, which means the first iteration will have `j = m - 2`.
3. **Execution**: In each iteration, `j` will increment by 1. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `j` must be able to reach `m - 2` (the initial value) and then increment to `m - 1` (which would cause the loop to exit).

Since `j` starts at `m - 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute if `m - 2 < m - 1`, which is always true.

Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 1 (as stated).
- `j` is set to `m - 2`.

Thus, the only condition we need to ensure is that `m` is greater than 1, as this guarantees that `j` will be valid for at least one iteration.

State: **`m` must be greater than 1**
