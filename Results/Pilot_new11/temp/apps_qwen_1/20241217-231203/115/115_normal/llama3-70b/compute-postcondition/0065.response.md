According to the given code, the loop will iterate over each tuple in the `ops` list. For the loop to execute, the `ops` list must contain at least one tuple.

Let's analyze the given states and determine which ones need to be adjusted:

1. **`m` is greater than 1**: This ensures that there are at least two columns, which might indirectly imply that there could be valid operations. However, this alone does not guarantee the existence of at least one valid tuple in `ops`.

2. **`ops` is a list containing all valid tuples `(i+1, j+1)` for which at least one of the conditions ... is true**: This condition is already satisfied as per the problem statement. No adjustment needed here.

3. **`i` is `n-1` and `j` is `m-1`**: These values are fixed at the start of the loop and do not affect the execution of the loop itself. No adjustment needed here.

4. **The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500**: This condition is already satisfied as per the problem statement. No adjustment needed here.

5. **The length of `ops` is printed**: This information is provided but does not directly impact the execution of the loop. It just indicates the length of `ops`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `ops` is not empty. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `ops` must have at least one element.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500**
