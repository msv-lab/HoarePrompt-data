Functionality: **The function accepts a \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\) where each element is either 0 or 1, along with the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) (where \(2 \le n, m \le 50\)). It identifies all positions \((i+1, j+1)\) within the matrix where at least one of the four adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) is 1. It then checks if the number of such positions is greater than 2500. If it is, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of these positions followed by the positions themselves.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the matrix \(A\) is empty or the dimensions \(n\) or \(m\) are less than 2, the function will raise a ValueError because the initial inputs do not meet the required constraints.
- The function assumes that the matrix \(A\) is fully defined for the given dimensions \(n\) and \(m\). If any part of the matrix is undefined, the function behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where \(n\) or \(m\) are exactly 2, although this is technically within the specified range. This could potentially be an edge case depending on the expected behavior.
- The function does not check for the presence of diagonal elements (i.e., top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left), only the immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors.
