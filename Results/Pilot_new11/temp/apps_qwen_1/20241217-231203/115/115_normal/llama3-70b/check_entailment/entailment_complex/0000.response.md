Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Matrix Transformation Logic**:
   - The program checks if any of the four adjacent cells of a position \((i, j)\) are 1. However, it does not actually perform the operations to transform matrix \(B\) into matrix \(A\). Instead, it simply collects positions where at least one of the four adjacent cells is 1. This does not guarantee that the resulting matrix \(B\) will match \(A\).

2. **Operation Execution**:
   - The problem description requires the program to execute specific operations (setting \(2 \times 2\) submatrices to all 1s) to make matrix \(B\) equal to matrix \(A\). The program does not implement this logic. Instead, it just identifies positions that could potentially be involved in such operations, without actually performing them.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs a list of positions \((i+1, j+1)\) where at least one of the four adjacent cells is 1, but it does not ensure that these positions are sufficient to transform \(B\) into \(A\). It also does not provide the actual sequence of operations to achieve the transformation.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the number of such positions is greater than 2500 and outputs \(-1\) in that case. However, this check alone is insufficient because it does not guarantee that a valid sequence of operations exists.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

The program would identify positions \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((1,3)\), and \((2,2)\) as they have at least one adjacent cell that is 1. However, it does not actually perform the operations to transform \(B\) into \(A\). The correct sequence of operations would be:
```
1 1
1 2
2 2
```

But the program instead prints:
```
3
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

This output is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual operations needed to transform \(B\) into \(A\).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required operations to transform matrix \(B\) into matrix \(A\) as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is not correct.
