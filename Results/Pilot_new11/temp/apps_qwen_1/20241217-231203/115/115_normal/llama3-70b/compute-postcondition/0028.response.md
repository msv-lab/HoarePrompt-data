The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. This operation does not change the values of `m` or the elements in the 2D list `A`. The condition that at least one of the elements A[i][j], A[i + 1][j], A[i][j + 1], or A[i + 1][j + 1] is equal to 1 remains true. 

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements A[i][j], A[i + 1][j], A[i][j + 1], and A[i + 1][j + 1] all equal to 1; at least one of the following conditions is true: A[i][j] == 1, A[i + 1][j] == 1, A[i][j + 1] == 1, or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1; `ops` is a list containing the element (i + 1, j + 1)**.
