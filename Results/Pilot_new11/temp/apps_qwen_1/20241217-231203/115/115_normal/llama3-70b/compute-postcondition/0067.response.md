According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ops`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ops`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `ops` must have at least one element.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- The code prints `op[0]` and `op[1]`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `ops`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must have at least two elements remaining (because it already printed one element).

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be decreased by 1, so `i` will become `n-2`.
- `j` will remain `m-1` unless `ops` runs out of elements, but since we are only concerned with the condition for the loop to continue, `j` stays the same.
- `ops` must have at least two elements remaining.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `m` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `ops` must have at least two elements.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `j` is `m-1`.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least two elements, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`**
