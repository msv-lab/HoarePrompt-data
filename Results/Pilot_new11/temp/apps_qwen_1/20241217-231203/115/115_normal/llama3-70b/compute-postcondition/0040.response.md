Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1 for all valid indices within the bounds of the list; `ops` is a list containing all valid pairs \((i+1, j+1)\) for which the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) are true; `j` is 0; `i` is \(n-1\).**
