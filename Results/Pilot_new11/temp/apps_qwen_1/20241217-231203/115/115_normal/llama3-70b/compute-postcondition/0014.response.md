The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the variables `m` and `j` are unchanged, and `i` remains unknown but part of the tuple. The condition related to `A[i][j]` to `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is not directly affected by this line of code, so it remains as described.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 1, `i` is unknown, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
