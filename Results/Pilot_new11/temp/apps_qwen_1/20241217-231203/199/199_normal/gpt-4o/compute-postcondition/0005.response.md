`b` is assigned the value of `a`. The initial value of `a` is 1, so `b` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and n is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and n is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**
