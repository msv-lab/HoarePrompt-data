Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and n is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`. The remainder when `rem` is divided by 2 is 0 and `rem` is greater than 0. If the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` is incremented by 1.***
