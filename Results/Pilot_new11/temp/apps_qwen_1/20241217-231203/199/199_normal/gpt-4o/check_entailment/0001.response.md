Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility that the lengths `a`, `b`, and `rem // 2` could form the sides of a rectangle without forming a square. For example, in the test case `n = 20`, the program misses the valid combinations `{3, 3, 7, 7}` and `{4, 4, 6, 6}` because it incorrectly assumes that `a` cannot be equal to `rem // 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that `a`, `b`, and `rem // 2` are distinct. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            c = (n - 2 * a - b) // 2
            if a != b and b != c and a != c:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` and calculates `c` accordingly, ensuring that all lengths are distinct, which prevents the formation of a square.
