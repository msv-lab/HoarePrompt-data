    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid `(a, b)` pairs such that \(a \in [1, \frac{n}{4}]\) and \(b = a\) with \(rem = n - 2(a + b)\) being greater than 0 and even, `a` is \(\frac{n}{4}\), `b` is \(\frac{n}{4}\), and `rem` is \(0\).
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of valid (a, b) pairs such that a ∈ [1, n/4] and b = a with rem = n - 2(a + b) being greater than 0 and even
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\). It checks if `n` is less than 6. If true, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through values of `a` from 1 to \(\frac{n}{4}\), setting `b` to `a` and calculating `rem` as `n - 2(a + b)`. It counts the number of valid `(a, b)` pairs where `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and not equal to `a`. After the loop, it returns the count of such valid pairs.
