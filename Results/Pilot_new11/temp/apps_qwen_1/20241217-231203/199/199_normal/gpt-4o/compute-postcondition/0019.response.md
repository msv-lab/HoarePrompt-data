In the initial state, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\); `count` is 1 if `a_prev + 1` equals `rem // 2` (where `rem = n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`), otherwise `count` remains 0; `a` is `a_prev + 1`; `b` is `a_prev + 2`; `rem` is `n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = a
```

This line assigns the value of `a` to `b`. Since `a` was defined as `a_prev + 1`, `b` will now also hold this value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\); `count` is 1 if `a_prev + 1` equals `rem // 2` (where `rem = n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`), otherwise `count` remains 0; `a` is `a_prev + 1`; `b` is `a_prev + 1`; `rem` is `n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`.**
