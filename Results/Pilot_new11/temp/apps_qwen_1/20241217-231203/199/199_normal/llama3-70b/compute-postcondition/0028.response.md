`ways` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, so the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and the conditions for `a` and `b` stay the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1.
