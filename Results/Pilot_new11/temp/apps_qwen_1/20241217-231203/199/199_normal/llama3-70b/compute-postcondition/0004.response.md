`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is 0, `a` is not `b`, and the current value of `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. After executing `ways += 1`, the value of `ways` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is 1, `a` is not `b` and the current value of `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`**
