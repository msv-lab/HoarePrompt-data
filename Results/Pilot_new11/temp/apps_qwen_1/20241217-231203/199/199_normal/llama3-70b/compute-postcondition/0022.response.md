The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since the initial state is that `ways` either increases by 1 or remains unchanged, and now it is being incremented by 1, the value of `ways` is updated. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\), and `ways` is increased by 1.**
