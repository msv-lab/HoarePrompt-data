`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the condition for `b` is also maintained, i.e., `b` is within the range starting from 1 and reaching up to \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\), and satisfies \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\).

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is within the range starting from 1 and reaching up to \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\), and `a \neq b` and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\); `ways` is incremented by 1.**
