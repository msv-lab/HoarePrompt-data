According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `a` up to but not including `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
- `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
- `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
- `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if the condition holds. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to find the next value of `b` that satisfies the condition `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Let's break it down:
1. The current value of `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
2. For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

Since `b` is the next value in the range, the next value of `b` would be `b + 1` (if `b + 1` is within the range). Therefore, the new value of `b` should be `b + 1` if it still lies within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if the condition holds. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.**

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `b` will be incremented by 1, i.e., `b` becomes `b + 1` if `b + 1` is still within the range.
- `ways` remains unchanged unless the new `b` satisfies the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if the condition holds. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.**
