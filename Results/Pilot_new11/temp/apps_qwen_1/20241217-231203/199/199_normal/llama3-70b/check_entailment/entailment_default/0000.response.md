Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code checks if there exist two integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). While this condition ensures that the sum of the four parts can form a rectangle, it does not guarantee that the parts cannot form a square.

For the given constraints, the correct approach would be to ensure that the four parts are distinct and their sum equals \(n\). However, the current implementation allows for pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) could be the same, which would allow the formation of a square if \(a = b\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 8\):
- The code would incorrectly count \((1, 3, 1, 3)\) as a valid way to split the stick because \(2 \times (1 + 3) == 8\) and \(1 \neq 3\).
- However, \((1, 3, 1, 3)\) can form a square, which violates the problem constraints.

A corrected version of the code should ensure that all four parts are distinct and their sum equals \(n\). Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 3 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            c = n - a - b
            d = n - a - b - c
            if c > 0 and d > 0 and a != b != c != d:
                ways += 1
    return ways

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected code ensures that all four parts are distinct and their sum equals \(n\), thereby satisfying the problem constraints.
