Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is determined based on `high`, `high` is adjusted based on the condition of `total < s`, `mid` is \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` remains as \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\). Otherwise, `high` is reduced by 1 and `low` is set to \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\).***
