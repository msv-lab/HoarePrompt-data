The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `s` respectively. This means the initial values of `n` and `s` will be replaced by the input values. The variable `v` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.**
