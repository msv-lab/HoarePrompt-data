Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the binary search implementation does not guarantee that the sum of the minimum values meets the requirement `s`. The issue lies in the binary search range initialization and the condition checking inside the loop.

1. **Initialization of `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is initialized to `0`, which could be too small if the smallest value in `v` is greater than `s / n`.
   - `high` is initialized to the minimum value in `v`, which might be too large if the smallest value in `v` is close to `s / n`.

2. **Binary Search Condition:**
   - The condition `if total < s:` should update `low` to `mid`, but the condition `else: high = mid - 1` might not be sufficient because `mid` could be too large, causing the sum to exceed `s`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 6
  3 4 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The smallest possible amount of kvass in the least keg is `2`, as the Fair Nut can take `2` liters from the first keg, `2` liters from the second keg, and `2` liters from the third keg.

- Program Output:
  - The program incorrectly outputs `3`, which is not the correct solution.

Here is an updated version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    
    if s > sum(v):
        print(-1)
        return
    
    low = 0
    high = s // n + 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total >= s:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search range is appropriate and correctly handles the conditions to find the smallest possible amount of kvass in the least keg.
