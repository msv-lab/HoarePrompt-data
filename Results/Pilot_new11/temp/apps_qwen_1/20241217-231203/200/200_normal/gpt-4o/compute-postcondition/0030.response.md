Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or adjusted based on the value of `i` (either `volumes[0] - volumes[1]` or `volumes[0] - volumes[1] - possible_to_take`), `i` is 2, and `possible_to_take` is either `volumes[1] - volumes[0]` if `i` is 1 or `min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], volumes[0] - volumes[1])`.***
