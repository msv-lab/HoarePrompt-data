Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( s \) from standard input, followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the volumes \( v_i \). It then sorts the volumes in non-decreasing order. The function calculates the minimum keg volume required to hold at least \( s \) units of kvass, considering the available volumes. If the total volume is less than \( s \), it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it adjusts the minimum keg volume based on the remaining kvass that cannot be accommodated by the current volumes and prints the adjusted minimum keg volume. Potential edge cases include when the total volume is exactly \( s \) or when the remaining kvass cannot be evenly distributed among the kegs.**
