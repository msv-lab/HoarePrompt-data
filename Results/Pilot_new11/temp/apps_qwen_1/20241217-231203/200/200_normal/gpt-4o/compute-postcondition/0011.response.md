The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables outside of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state will include all the preconditions that are still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is 0, and `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume**.
