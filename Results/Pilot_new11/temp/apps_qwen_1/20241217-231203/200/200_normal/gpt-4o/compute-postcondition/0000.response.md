The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `s`. Since the actual input values are not provided, we know that `n` and `s` will be assigned the values read from input, which are within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, inclusive; `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^12, inclusive; `v_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, inclusive for each `i` where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`.**
