Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the standard input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. This matches the problem description's input format.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that `min_lemon` is the maximum number of sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be formed without breaking the fruit.
   - It then computes the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote by adding `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `a < b // 2` or `a < c // 4`, the limiting factor is `a`, so `min_lemon` will be `a`.
   - If `b // 2 < c // 4`, the limiting factor is `b // 2`, so `min_lemon` will be `b // 2`.
   - If `c // 4 < a`, the limiting factor is `c // 4`, so `min_lemon` will be `c // 4`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, `min_lemon` will be the smallest of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote, which is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.
   - If `min_lemon` is 0 (i.e., all values are less than their required multiples), the output will be 0, indicating that no fruits can be used.

Given that the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and produces the expected results for all valid inputs, it is correct.
