`min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The code calculates `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` and prints it. The calculation simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the code, only `min_lemon` is used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input by the user; `b` is an integer input by the user; `c` is an integer input by the user; `min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`; the value printed is `7 * min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user; `b` is an integer input by the user; `c` is an integer input by the user; `min_lemon` is the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`; the value printed is `7 * min_lemon`**
