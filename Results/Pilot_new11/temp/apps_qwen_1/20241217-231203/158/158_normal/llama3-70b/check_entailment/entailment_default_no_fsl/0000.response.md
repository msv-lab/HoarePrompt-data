Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote while maintaining the required ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The code uses the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears to determine how many sets of the required ratio can be formed. This approach ensures that the solution works for all valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 1000). Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case as per the problem description.
