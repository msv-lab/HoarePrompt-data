Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio (1:2:4). The `min_lemon` variable is set to the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, ensuring that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available quantities of apples and pears. The final output is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which represents the total number of fruits used in the compote. The output hints confirm that the program reads three non-negative integers and calculates the sum of the fruits based on the specified ratio, aligning with the problem description and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
