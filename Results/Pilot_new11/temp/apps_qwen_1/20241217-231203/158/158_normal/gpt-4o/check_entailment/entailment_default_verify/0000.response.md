Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio. The function reads three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\)), and calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, ensuring that the number of apples and pears is sufficient. The total number of fruits used is then computed and printed. The provided output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected within the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
