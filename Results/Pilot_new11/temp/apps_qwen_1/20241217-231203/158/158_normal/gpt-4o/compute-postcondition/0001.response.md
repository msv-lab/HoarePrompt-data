The code `b = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input from the user to the variable `b`. The previous value of `a` is still an integer input from the user, and `c` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000**
