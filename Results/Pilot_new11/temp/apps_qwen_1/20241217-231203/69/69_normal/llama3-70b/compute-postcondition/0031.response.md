The code `uy -= 1` decrements the value of `uy` by 1. The value of `uy` was previously determined by the last processed character in the sequence, but since the exact value of `uy` before this operation is not specified, we only know that it has been decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must have at least three characters, `uy` is decreased by 1.**
