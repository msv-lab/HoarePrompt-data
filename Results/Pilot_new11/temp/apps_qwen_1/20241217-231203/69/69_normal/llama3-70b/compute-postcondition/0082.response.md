Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the last operation in the string, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is the count of invalid operations. `ux` is the sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements, `uy` is the sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements.** 

Explanation:
- The loop processes each operation in the string `ops`.
- After processing all operations in `ops`, `op` will be the last operation in the string.
- `ux` and `uy` will be the final sums of horizontal and vertical movements, respectively.
- `dx` and `dy` will be the final differences between the starting positions (`x` and `y`) and these sums.
- `res` will be the count of invalid operations, where an operation was not applied because it did not meet the specified conditions.

Since the loop processes all operations in `ops`, and each operation updates `dx`, `dy`, or increments `res` based on certain conditions, the final values of `dx` and `dy` reflect the net movement from the initial position, and `res` reflects the number of times no action was taken due to invalid conditions.
