`x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input from the user using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `x` and `y` will now hold the integer values separated by spaces in the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, the sequence is a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string input from the user.**
