The code `dx += 1` increments the value of `dx` by 1. Since `dx` was initially the updated value of horizontal movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'R', otherwise unchanged), and now it is incremented by 1, the new value of `dx` will depend on its initial value. However, without knowing the exact initial value, we can only say that `dx` has been incremented by 1.

The states of the other variables (`ops`, `op`, `dy`, and `res`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'U', otherwise unchanged), `res` is 0, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement incremented by 1**
