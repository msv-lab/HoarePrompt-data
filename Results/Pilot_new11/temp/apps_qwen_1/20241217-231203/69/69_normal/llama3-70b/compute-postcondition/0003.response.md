The code initializes four variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `sequence`, `x`, `y`, or `ops`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string input from the user, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**
