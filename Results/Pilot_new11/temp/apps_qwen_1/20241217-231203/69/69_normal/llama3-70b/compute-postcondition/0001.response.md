The variable `ops` is assigned the value of an input string from the user, which represents a sequence of operations. The values of `n`, `sequence`, and `x, y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the user, the sequence is a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x, y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `ops` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, the sequence is a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x, y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `ops` is a string input from the user.**
