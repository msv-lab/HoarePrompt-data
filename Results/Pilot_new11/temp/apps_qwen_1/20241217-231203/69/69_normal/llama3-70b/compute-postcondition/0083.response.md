The `print(res)` statement prints the value of the variable `res`, which represents the count of invalid operations. However, the code itself does not change the value of `res`. The states of the other variables (`ops`, `op`, `dx`, `dy`, `ux`, `uy`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the last operation in the string, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is the count of invalid operations, `ux` is the sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements, `uy` is the sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements. The value of `res` is printed.**
