`dy` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `dy`, but it is known that `dy` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The other variables (`ops`, `op`, `dx`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'R', otherwise unchanged), `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement and is now `dy + 1`, and `res` is 0.**
