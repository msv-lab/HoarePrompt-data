The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. It processes a series of movement operations ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and calculates the minimum number of operations required to move from the final position `(final_x, final_y)` to a target position `(x, y)`. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. The function first computes the final coordinates `(final_x, final_y)` based on the operations.
2. It then checks if the initial position `(x, y)` matches the final position `(final_x, final_y)`. If they match, it returns `0` because no additional moves are needed.
3. If the positions do not match, it proceeds to find the minimum number of operations needed to reach the target position `(x, y)` from any previously visited position. This involves tracking visited positions and their corresponding indices in the `operations` string using a dictionary `position_map`.
4. The function iterates through each operation, updating the current coordinates and checking if the target position `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` has been visited before. If it has, it updates the `min_length` with the minimum number of steps taken to reach this position.
5. Finally, it returns `min_length` if it is not infinity, otherwise, it returns `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the initial position matches the final position, returning `0`.
- The function correctly tracks and updates the `min_length` by considering all visited positions and their indices.
- However, the function does not handle the case where the target position `(x, y)` cannot be reached from any previously visited position, which would result in `min_length` remaining infinity, and thus returning `-1`.
