The code `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i` updates the `position_map` dictionary to set the value at the key `(current_x, current_y)` to `i`. Given that `i` is initially 2, this means that the key `(current_x, current_y)` now maps to the value `2`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on `operations[2]`, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and 1, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 2)`.**
