`final_x` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `final_x` is not specified. However, since it is modified, we can denote its new value as `final_x + 1`. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `final_x` is increased by 1**
