Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`. If `operations[i] == 'D'`, then `current_y` is `operations[1] - 1`; otherwise, `current_x` is either one less than its previous value or 2, and `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`.**
