Postcondition: **`i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` equals 'U', `current_y` is set to 1. If `operations[i]` equals 'D', `current_y` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` equals 'L', `current_x` is set to -1. If `operations[i]` equals 'R', `current_x` is set to 1. In any other case, the values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged.**
