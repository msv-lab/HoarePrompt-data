`current_y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`. Since only `current_y` is affected, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `current_y` is incremented by 1, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`.
