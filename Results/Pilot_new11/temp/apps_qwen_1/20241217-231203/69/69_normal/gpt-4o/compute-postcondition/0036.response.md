Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_x` is the sum of the contributions of 'R' and 'L' operations to the x-coordinate, `final_y` is the sum of the contributions of 'U' and 'D' operations to the y-coordinate; `x` and `y` are the final positions after executing all operations in `operations`.**
