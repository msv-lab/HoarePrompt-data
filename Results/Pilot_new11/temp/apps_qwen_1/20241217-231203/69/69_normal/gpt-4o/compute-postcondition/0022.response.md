The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `final_x` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise it is 0, the new value of `final_x` will be 2 if `op` is 'R', or 1 if `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L'. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `final_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'; `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9`; `final_x` is 2 if the next operation character `op` is 'R' and the original `final_x` was 1, otherwise `final_x` is 1; `final_y` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is -1 if the next operation character `op` is 'D'**
