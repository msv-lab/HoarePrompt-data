`final_y` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_y` is `y - 1`.
