Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to consider the possibility that the sequence of operations might need to be changed even if the final position `(final_x, final_y)` is not exactly the target position `(x, y)`. 

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

The code computes the final position as `(1, 3)` and the target position is `(-2, 3)`. The difference in the x-coordinate is `1 - (-2) = 3`, which cannot be achieved by any single operation without changing multiple operations. Therefore, the sequence must be changed, but the code incorrectly returns `3` instead of `0` because it only checks if the final position matches the target position and does not consider the necessary changes to achieve the target position.

The correct approach should involve dynamically checking and adjusting the operations to minimize the length of the changed subsegment. The current implementation does not fully address this requirement, hence it is incorrect.
