`final_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_x` was an integer within the range specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_x` is `initial_final_x - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_x` is `initial_final_x - 1`**
