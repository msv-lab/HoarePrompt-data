Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). If `op` is 'U', `final_y` is 1. If `op` is 'D', `y` is updated to `y - 1`. If `op` is 'L' or any other character, `x` is updated to `initial_final_x - 1` if `op` is 'L', otherwise `x` is updated to `initial_final_x + 1`.***
