`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same, `operations` remains the same, `x` and `y` remain initialized to 0, and `op` remains 'L'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is -1; `final_y` is 0; `x` and `y` are initialized to 0; `op` is the current operation character in the loop; `op` is 'L'**
