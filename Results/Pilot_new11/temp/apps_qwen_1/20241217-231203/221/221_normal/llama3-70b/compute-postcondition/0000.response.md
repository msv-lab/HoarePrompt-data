The code reads two integers from input, splits them, and assigns them to `s` and `x`. Since the exact input values are not specified, the output state will reflect that `s` and `x` are now assigned the values of the input integers.

Output State: **`s` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `x` is an integer between 0 and 10^12**
