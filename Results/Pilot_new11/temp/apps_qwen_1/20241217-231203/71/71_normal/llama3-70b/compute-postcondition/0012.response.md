The code snippet provided is incomplete because there is no definition for the variable `w`. However, based on the given initial state and the print statement, we can infer that `w` is not defined in the provided snippet, and thus the print statement will raise a NameError.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `n // 10`

Since `w` is not defined, the print statement will result in an error. The output state will reflect this error.

Output State: **The print statement raises a NameError due to the undefined variable `w`.**
