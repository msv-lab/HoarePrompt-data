`w` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `w` is not specified in the initial state. The only information given is that `n` is `n // 10` and `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\). Therefore, the output state is: `w` is increased by 1, `n` is `n // 10` and `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\).

Output State: **`w` is increased by 1, `n` is `n // 10` and `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\)**
