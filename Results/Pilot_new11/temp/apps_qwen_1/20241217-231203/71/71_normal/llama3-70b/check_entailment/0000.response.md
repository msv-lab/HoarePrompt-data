Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the given number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. For example, consider the input:

- Input
  ```
  10203040 2
  ```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output `1`, but the correct answer should be `3` because we need to remove three digits (1, 2, and 3) to make the number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). The program only checks if the last `k` digits form a number divisible by \(10^k\) and does not ensure that there are enough trailing zeros to achieve this.
