`n` and `k` are assigned their respective values from the input split into two integers. The original values of these variables are lost during the assignment operation, but the input values are stored in `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output state is defined by the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
