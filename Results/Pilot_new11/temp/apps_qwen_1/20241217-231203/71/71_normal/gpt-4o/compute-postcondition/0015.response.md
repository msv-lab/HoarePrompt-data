`to_remove` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `to_remove` changes from its previous value (which was 1 if the digit is not '0' and 0 if it is '0') to `to_remove + 1`. The initial value of `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', and 0 if it is '0'. After adding 1, `to_remove` will be 2 if the digit is not '0', and 1 if it is '0'. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0', `to_remove` is 2 if the digit is not '0' and 1 if it is '0'**
