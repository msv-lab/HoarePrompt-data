According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `n` in reverse order. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-empty string because an empty string would cause the loop to terminate immediately.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`n`**: The string `n` must contain at least one character to ensure the loop can execute. If `n` is an empty string, the loop will not run.
2. **`digit`**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, `digit` will be assigned each character in the string `n` during the loop execution. We do not need to adjust the state for `digit` since it will be set within the loop.
3. **`k`**: The variable `k` is an integer and is not directly involved in the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
4. **`count_zeros`**: This variable will be incremented or modified inside the loop based on the value of `digit`. Since we are only concerned with the state before the loop starts, no adjustment is needed for this variable.
5. **`to_remove`**: Similar to `count_zeros`, this variable will be updated inside the loop and does not affect the loop's ability to start.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments are focused on ensuring `n` is a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**
