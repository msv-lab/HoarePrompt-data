`to_remove` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the number of digits not yet processed plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed + 1**
