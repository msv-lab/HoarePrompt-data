`count_zeros` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `count_zeros` increases by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `to_remove`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0' (it was previously 1 or 0 and has now increased by 1), and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0.**
