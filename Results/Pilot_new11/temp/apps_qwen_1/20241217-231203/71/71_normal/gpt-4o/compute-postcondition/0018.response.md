Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, and `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged (i.e., `to_remove` is decremented for any digit).***
