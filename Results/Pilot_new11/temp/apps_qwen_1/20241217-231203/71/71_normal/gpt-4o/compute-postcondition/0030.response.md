Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a non-negative integer, `count_zeros` is the total count of zeros in `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` (if `count_zeros` reaches `k`, the loop breaks), `to_remove` is the number of digits in `n` that have not been processed when the loop breaks or 0 if the loop does not execute, if `count_zeros` equals `k`, the value of `to_remove` is printed; otherwise, the printed value is `len(n) - 1`.***
