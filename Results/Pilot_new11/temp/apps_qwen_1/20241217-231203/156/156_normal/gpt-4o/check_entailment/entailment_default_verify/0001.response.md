Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the described movement pattern for Lara. The logic handles both the initial vertical movement and the subsequent snake-like movement accurately. The output hints also confirm that the function processes the inputs as specified and correctly calculates the row and column for each step.

The original assessment is accurate because the program meets the requirements and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that the code fails to handle properly. The function correctly processes the input parameters and generates the expected output for all given test cases.
