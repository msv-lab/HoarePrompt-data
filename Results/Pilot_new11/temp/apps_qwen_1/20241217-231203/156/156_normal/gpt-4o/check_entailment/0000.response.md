Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine Lara's current position based on the number of moves \( k \). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initial Moves**: If \( k < n - 1 \), Lara is still in the first column. The program correctly prints the row and column based on the number of moves made.

2. **Subsequent Moves**: For \( k \geq n - 1 \), Lara has already completed the initial downward movement from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner. The program then calculates the number of full rows and the remaining steps to accurately determine the final position in the snake-like pattern.

The program handles the following scenarios:
- When \( k < n - 1 \): Lara is still in the first column.
- When \( k \geq n - 1 \): Lara has completed the initial downward movement and is now in the snake-like pattern.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines Lara's position for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
