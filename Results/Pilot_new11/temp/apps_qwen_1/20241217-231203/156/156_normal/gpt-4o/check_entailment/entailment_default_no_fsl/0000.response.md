Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case when `k == n - 1`. According to the problem description, when Lara reaches the bottom-left corner (cell `(n, 1)`), she starts moving in a snake fashion. However, the current implementation does not handle this transition properly. Specifically, the code transitions directly from moving down to moving right without considering the exact position at which this transition should occur.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 3`, the expected output should be `3 1` because after moving down to `(4, 1)`, the next step should be to move right to `(3, 1)` and then up to `(3, 2)`. However, the current code will incorrectly output `3 2` because it does not account for the specific position change at `k == n - 1`.

Here is the corrected code snippet to handle this case:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k == n - 1:
        print(n, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
