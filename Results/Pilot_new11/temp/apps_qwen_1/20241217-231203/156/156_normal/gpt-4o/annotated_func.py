#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that n is even, and 0 <= k < n * m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a value in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is `n - full_rows`, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`. If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is calculated as `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is determined as `n - full_rows`, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`. Finally, `row, col` are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`). It processes these parameters to determine and print the values of `row` and `col` based on certain conditions. Specifically:
1. If `k < n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` followed by `1`.
2. If `k >= n - 1`, it calculates `full_rows` as `k // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`. Then, it determines `row` as `n - full_rows` and `col` as either `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`. Finally, it prints `row` and `col`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `k == n - 1` explicitly; however, since the logic for `k >= n - 1` is defined, it implicitly covers this case.
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the given code.
