Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how the program handles different scenarios as described:

1. **Initial Movement Down:**
   - For the first \(n - 1\) steps, Lara moves down from \((1, 1)\) to \((n, 1)\).
   - The program correctly handles this scenario by printing the coordinates directly:
     ```python
     if (k < n - 1) :
         print(k + 1, 1)
     ```

2. **Subsequent Snake-like Movement:**
   - After reaching \((n, 1)\), Lara starts moving in a snake-like pattern to the right, up, then left to the second column, repeating this pattern.
   - The program correctly handles the subsequent movements:
     ```python
     else :
         k -= n - 1
         full_rows = k // (m - 1)
         remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
         if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
             row = n - full_rows
             col = 2 + remaining_steps
         else :
             row = n - full_rows
             col = m - remaining_steps
         print(row, col)
     ```
   - Here, `full_rows` represents the number of complete rows of movement in the snake pattern.
   - `remaining_steps` represents the remaining steps within the current row of the snake pattern.
   - Depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, the program calculates the appropriate row and column.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the transition from the initial downward movement to the snake-like pattern correctly.
   - It implicitly covers the case where \(k == n - 1\) by transitioning smoothly into the snake-like pattern without explicit handling.

Given that the program correctly follows the logic for both the initial downward movement and the subsequent snake-like pattern, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
