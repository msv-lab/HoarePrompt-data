The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` where `n` and `m` are even and positive integers within the range \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). It calculates and prints a pair of integers based on the value of `k`. Specifically, `k` is first reduced modulo \(n \cdot 2 - 2\). Depending on the value of `k`:
- If \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), it prints \(k + 1\) and \(1\).
- If \(n - 1 \leq k < n \cdot 2 - 2\), it calculates and prints \(2n - k - 2\) and \(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1} + 1\).
- If \(k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2\), it prints \(1\) and \(2\).

This covers all possible values of `k` and ensures the correct output is produced based on the adjusted value of `k`. There are no explicit return values, so the function's effect is observable through its printed output.
