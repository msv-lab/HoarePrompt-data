Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly simulate Lara's movement pattern through the dungeon as described in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Initial Downward Movement**: The code does not simulate Lara moving down all the way to cell (n, 1) before starting her snake-like movement.
2. **Snake-like Movement**: The code assumes that after reaching cell (n, 1), Lara starts moving in a snake-like pattern, but it does not correctly simulate the transition from downward movement to the snake-like movement.
3. **Handling of `k`**: The value of `k` is correctly reduced modulo \(n \cdot 2 - 2\), but the logic to determine the position after this reduction does not accurately reflect the movement pattern.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3 5
```
According to the problem description, after entering the dungeon in cell (1, 1) and moving down to cell (4, 1), Lara would start moving in a snake-like pattern. The fifth move should place her in cell (3, 2), but the code incorrectly places her in cell (2, 2).

To fix this, the code needs to explicitly handle the initial downward movement and then the subsequent snake-like movement pattern. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initial downward movement
    k -= n - 1
    if k < 0:
        print(n, 1)
        return
    
    # Snake-like movement
    k %= 2 * (m - 1)
    if k == 0:
        print(1, 2)
    elif k <= m - 1:
        print(n - (k - 1) // 2, (m - 1) - (k - 1) % 2)
    else:
        print((n - 1) - (k - m) // 2, 2 + (k - m) % 2)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the initial downward movement and then simulates the snake-like movement pattern, ensuring the correct position for any given `k`.
