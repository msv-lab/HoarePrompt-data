Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement Lara's movement pattern for certain values of `k`. Specifically, the logic for calculating the cell when `n - 1 <= k < n * 2 - 2` is incorrect. According to the problem description, Lara moves in a snake fashion after reaching the bottom left corner, but the code does not properly handle this part of the movement.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 3 7
```

Expected output (based on the problem description):
```
3 2
```

However, the given code outputs:
```
2 2
```

The issue arises because the code incorrectly calculates the row and column for the snake movement phase. Specifically, the row calculation `2*n - k - 2` and the column calculation `\(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1} + 1\)` do not align with Lara's actual movement pattern.

To fix this, the code needs to correctly simulate the snake-like movement pattern after the initial linear downward movement. This would involve more complex logic to track the direction and position of Lara during the snake movement phase.
