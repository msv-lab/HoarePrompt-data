The code `k %= n * 2 - 2` takes the current value of `k` and updates it to be the remainder when `k` is divided by `n * 2 - 2`. Given that `n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `n * 2 - 2` will be an even number between 2 and \(2 \times 10^9 - 2\). Since `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\), `k` can take any value in this range. After the operation, `k` will be updated to its equivalent value modulo `n * 2 - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)]; `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)]; `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m` and `k` is updated to be `k % (n * 2 - 2)`**
