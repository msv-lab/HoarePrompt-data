Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is even. According to the problem description, the maximum number of games the winner can play depends on how players can pair up following the given rule. For even `n`, the solution provided by the program does not always yield the correct result. For example, when `n = 4`, the correct output should be `2`, as shown in the problem description. However, the program calculates `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1`, which results in `2` for `n = 4`. This calculation does not account for the specific pairing rule mentioned in the problem description, leading to incorrect results for certain values of `n`.
