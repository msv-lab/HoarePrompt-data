The code `print(max_games)` simply prints the value of `max_games`. It does not change the value of `max_games` itself. Given the initial state, `max_games` is one less than the bit length of `n`. The output of the print statement will be the value of `max_games`, but this value is not stored anywhere. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\); `max_games` is one less than the bit length of `n`; the value of `max_games` is printed.**
