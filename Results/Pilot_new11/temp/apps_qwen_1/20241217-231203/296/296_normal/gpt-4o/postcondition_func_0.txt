The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It checks if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself within the range \(2 \leq d \leq \sqrt{n}\). If `n` has no such divisors, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors (`k`) and each divisor `d` paired with 1, formatted as '1 d'.
