The code appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\)
- `divisors` is a list containing 2
- `i` is 2
- `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1
- `n % i == 0`
- The current value of `i` is not equal to `n // i`

Since `i` is 2 and `n % i == 0`, it means `n` is even. Therefore, `n // i` is `n / 2`. This value is appended to the `divisors` list.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing 2 and `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `n // i`**
