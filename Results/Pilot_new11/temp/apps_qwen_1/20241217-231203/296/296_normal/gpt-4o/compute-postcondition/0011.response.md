Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `divisors` is a list containing either 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1 (denoted as `d` where \(n \% d == 0\)).
   - `i` is 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1, with `i` being less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within this range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1, and it was less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and still be within the range `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `i` is the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1, incrementing `i` by 1 should still keep it within the range.
   - If `i` is 2, incrementing `i` by 1 makes it 3, which is still within the range.

6. **Final State:**
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1, `i + 1` will still be within the range unless `i` is already the maximum value `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- `n` remains the same.
- `divisors` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing either 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1 (denoted as `d` where \(n \% d == 0\)), and `i` is `i + 1` or the next smallest divisor of `n` other than 1, with `i + 1` being less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1.**
