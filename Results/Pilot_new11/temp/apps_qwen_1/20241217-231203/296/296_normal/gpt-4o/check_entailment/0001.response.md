Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sum of the fractions does not equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). For example, consider \(n = 6\):

- The program correctly identifies that \(b_i\) can be 2 or 3.
- However, it always uses the same value for \(a_i\) (which is 1), so the sum is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\), which is indeed \(1 - \frac{1}{6}\).

This seems to work for \(n = 6\), but let's consider another case, say \(n = 8\):

- The program identifies that \(b_i\) can be 2, 4.
- It would output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```

- However, \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\), which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\).

Thus, the program does not correctly generate a sequence of fractions that satisfy the condition for all \(n\).
