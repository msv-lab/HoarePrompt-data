Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program does not generate a sequence of fractions that sum up to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\) as required. Instead, it hard-codes a solution for \(n \neq 2\) without verifying if the sequence meets the conditions described in the problem.

### Issues:
1. **Hard-Coded Solution**: The program directly prints "YES" and generates a specific sequence without checking if such a sequence exists for any given \(n \neq 2\).
2. **Sequence Verification**: The program does not verify whether the generated sequence satisfies the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}\).
3. **Specific Case Handling**: For \(n = 2\), the program correctly prints "NO", but for other values of \(n\), it prints a fixed sequence without ensuring it meets the required condition.

### Correct Approach:
To meet the problem description, the program should:
1. Check if \(n = 2\). If true, print "NO".
2. For \(n > 2\), construct a sequence of fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) such that:
   - Each \(b_i\) divides \(n\) and \(1 < b_i < n\).
   - Each \(a_i\) is a positive integer satisfying \(1 \leq a_i < b_i\).
   - The sum of these fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

Here is a conceptual outline of how the correct program could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        
        # Find suitable b_i and a_i values
        def find_fractions(n):
            fractions = []
            for b in range(2, n):
                if n % b == 0:
                    a = 1
                    while a < b:
                        if (a / b) <= (1 - 1/n):
                            fractions.append((a, b))
                            a += 1
                        else:
                            break
            return fractions
        
        fractions = find_fractions(n)
        k = len(fractions)
        print(k)
        for frac in fractions:
            print(frac[0], frac[1])
```

This approach ensures that the generated sequence of fractions meets the required conditions for any \(n > 2\).
