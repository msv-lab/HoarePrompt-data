Functionality: **The function `func()` takes no parameters and processes a positive integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n // 2`. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n`. This covers all possible values of `n` within the specified range.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is exactly 2, the function prints 'NO'.
- For all other values of `n` (i.e., \(3 \leq n \leq 10^9\)), the function prints 'YES', `k` is set to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and either `n // 2` or `n` depending on whether `n` is even or odd.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no missing functionality in the provided code. The code correctly implements the described behavior for all possible values of `n` within the given range.
