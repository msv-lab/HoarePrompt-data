Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code only handles the case when \( n = 2 \), which results in printing 'NO'. For any other value of \( n \), the code prints 'YES' and provides a sequence of fractions \(\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\), but this does not necessarily satisfy the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

For example, consider \( n = 6 \):
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 3
  1 6
  ```
  because \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}\).

However, the provided code incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
2
1 3
1 6
```

This shows that the code does not generate the correct sequence of fractions for all \( n \). Therefore, the code is incorrect.
