`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which converts the user input into an integer. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) remains true, but the specific value of `n` changes to whatever the user inputs. All other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive.**
