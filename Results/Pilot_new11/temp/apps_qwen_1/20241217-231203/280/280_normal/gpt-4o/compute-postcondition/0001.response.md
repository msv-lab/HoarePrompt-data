`v1` is assigned the value `a`, `v2` is assigned the value `b`, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10. The code takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first input to `t` and the second input to `d`. The previous values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `t` is the first integer input and `d` is the second integer input.**
