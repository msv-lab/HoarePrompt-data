Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the speeds for each second does not guarantee that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value. Instead, the current implementation calculates each speed as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`, which does not necessarily ensure that the speed changes between adjacent seconds respect the constraint `|speeds[i] - speeds[i - 1]| ≤ d`.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:

- Input: `5 6 4 2`
- Expected behavior: The sequence of speeds should be `5, 7, 8, 6`, but due to the current logic, the sequence could be something like `5, 7, 10, 6`, which violates the constraint `|speeds[i] - speeds[i - 1]| ≤ 2`.

To correct this, the program should maintain a feasible sequence of speeds where the difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed `d`. One way to achieve this is by ensuring that the speed changes linearly between `v1` and `v2` while respecting the `d` constraint.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    
    # Calculate speeds ensuring the constraint is met
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = max(min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2), max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v1))
    
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
```

In this corrected version, the loop ensures that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value, thus meeting the problem description requirements.
