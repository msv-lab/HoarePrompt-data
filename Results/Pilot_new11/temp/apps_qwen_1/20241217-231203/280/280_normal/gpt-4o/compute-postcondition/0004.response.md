The code `speeds[-1] = v2` updates the last element of the `speeds` list to be the value of `v2`. Given the initial state, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `a` and the rest are `0`. Therefore, the last element of `speeds` is `0`.

After executing the code, the last element of `speeds` will be updated to `v2`. The other elements of `speeds` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is the first integer input, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements where the first element is `a`, and the last element is `v2`.**
