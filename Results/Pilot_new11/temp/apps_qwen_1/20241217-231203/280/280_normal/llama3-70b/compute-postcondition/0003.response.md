The code assigns the minimum value between `v1` and `v2` to the variable `min_speed`. The previous values of `v1` and `v2` are still valid and unaffected. The `max_speed` remains the same, being the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `min_speed` and the unchanged `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100); `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100); `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.**
