The code updates `min_speed` to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. To determine the new value of `min_speed`, we need to consider the initial values of `min_speed` and `max_speed`.

Given:
- `min_speed` is initially the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` - `d` if `v1` and `v2` - `d` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, else `max_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.

Let's denote:
- `v1` as `a`.
- `v2` as `b`.

So:
- `min_speed` is `min(a, b)`.
- `max_speed` is `max(a, b) - d` if `max(a, b) - d ≥ min(a, b)`, else `min(a, b)`.

The code changes `min_speed` to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Since `min_speed` can be either `a` or `b`, and `max_speed` can be either `max(a, b) - d` or `min(a, b)`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`:
   - `min_speed = a`.
   - `max_speed = max(a, b) - d` if `max(a, b) - d ≥ a`, else `max_speed = a`.

2. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`:
   - `min_speed = b`.
   - `max_speed = max(a, b) - d` if `max(a, b) - d ≥ b`, else `max_speed = b`.

In both cases, `min_speed` will be updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` - `d` if `v1` and `v2` - `d` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, else `max_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`**.
