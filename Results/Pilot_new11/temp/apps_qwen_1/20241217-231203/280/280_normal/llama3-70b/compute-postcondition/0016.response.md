Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `v1` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is at least 2
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`
- `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice
- `i` is 2

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` values from `t - 1` down to 1 (inclusive), with a step of -1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented by 1 to 1, and then it will decrement to 0, which is the stopping condition of the loop.

2. **Current Value of `i`**: 
   - `i` is currently 2.

3. **Next Value of `i`**: 
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Other States**: 
   - The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, and `max_length` do not change within the loop itself based on the information provided. They remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- All other states (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, `max_length`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice, `i` is 1**
