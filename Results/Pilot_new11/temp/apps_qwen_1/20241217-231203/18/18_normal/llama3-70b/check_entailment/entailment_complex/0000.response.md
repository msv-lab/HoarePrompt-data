Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from standard input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This matches the problem's requirement for input format and constraints.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - For \( t \leq n \): 
     - The program prints `min(t, k)`.
     - When \( t \leq n \), the first \( k \) spectators stand up sequentially. Therefore, at time \( t \), the number of standing spectators is either \( t \) or \( k \), whichever is smaller. This logic is correct as it accounts for the initial phase of the wave.
   - For \( t > n \):
     - The program prints \( k - (t - n) \% k \).
     - After time \( n \), the wave starts to repeat its cycle. The number of standing spectators can be calculated as \( k \) minus the remainder of \( (t - n) \) divided by \( k \). This ensures that after each complete cycle (of length \( k \)), the number of standing spectators decreases by one until it reaches zero and then repeats.

By analyzing these cases, the program accurately determines the number of standing spectators at any given time \( t \) within the specified range, thereby meeting the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
