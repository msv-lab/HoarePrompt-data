Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the output hints. It handles both cases where \( t \leq n \) and \( t > n \) appropriately. Specifically:
- When \( t \leq n \), the program prints the minimum value between \( t \) and \( k \), which matches the expected behavior.
- When \( t > n \), the program calculates the number of standing spectators correctly by subtracting the remainder of \( (t - n) \) divided by \( k \) from \( k \).

The program works as intended for the given examples and adheres to the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
