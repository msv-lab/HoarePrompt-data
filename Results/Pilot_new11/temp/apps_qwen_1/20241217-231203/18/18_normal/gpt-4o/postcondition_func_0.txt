The function processes three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq t < n + k \). It prints one of three possible values based on the relationship between these variables:

1. If \( t \leq k \), it prints \( t \).
2. If \( k < t \leq n \), it prints \( k \).
3. If \( t > n \), it prints \( n + k - t \).

The function accepts no direct parameters but operates internally with the given constraints on \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \). After executing, the program state will have one of these three values printed. The function handles all edge cases within the specified ranges.
