Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify each part:

1. **Initial Input**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from the input. These values satisfy the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq t < n + k \).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When \( t \leq k \):
     - According to the problem description, at time \( t \), the first \( t \) spectators stand up. Hence, the number of standing spectators is \( t \).
     - The program correctly prints \( t \) in this case.
   
   - **Case 2**: When \( k < t \leq n \):
     - From time \( k \) to time \( n \), all \( k \) spectators are standing, and the remaining spectators sit sequentially. Thus, the number of standing spectators is always \( k \).
     - The program correctly prints \( k \) in this case.
   
   - **Case 3**: When \( t > n \):
     - After time \( n \), the wave starts to reverse. Spectators start sitting again. Specifically, at time \( n + i \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq k \)), the \( (i+1) \)-th spectator stands and the \( i \)-th spectator sits.
     - To find the number of standing spectators at time \( t \), we calculate \( n + k - t \). This value represents the number of spectators who have not yet sat down.
     - The program correctly computes and prints \( n + k - t \) in this case.

Since the program handles all three cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each case, the program is correct.
