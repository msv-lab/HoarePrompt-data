Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`.
2. If `t` is between `k + 1` and `n`, the number of standing spectators is `k`.
3. If `t` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the number of standing spectators decreases linearly from `k` to `0` as `t` increases beyond `n`.

The program correctly handles these cases:
- For `t <= k`, it prints `t`.
- For `k < t <= n`, it prints `k`.
- For `t > n`, it calculates the number of standing spectators correctly by subtracting `(n + k - t)` from `n`.

Given the provided examples and the problem description, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
