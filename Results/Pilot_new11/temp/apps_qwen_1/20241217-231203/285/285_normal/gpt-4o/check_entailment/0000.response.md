Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses), calculates the remaining coins after buying `a` houses, then iterates over possible values of `b` (number of cars), calculates the remaining coins after buying `b` cars, and finally checks if the remaining coins are exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination exists, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO". This approach covers all potential cases as required by the problem description.
