Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the full range of potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not check if `n` is outside the specified range (1 to 10^9). According to the problem description, the input `n` is guaranteed to be within this range, and the code should return 'NO' if `n` is outside this range. However, the current implementation does not perform this check, which means it will incorrectly return 'YES' or 'NO' for inputs outside the range without any indication of the input being out of bounds.

For instance, if `n = 10^10`, the program will run unnecessarily and return either 'YES' or 'NO', both of which are incorrect according to the problem constraints. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
