The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It iterates through possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be purchased with `n` units of currency, where each house costs 1234567 units, each car costs 123456 units, and each computer costs 1234 units. For each combination, it checks if the remaining amount of money after purchasing the houses and cars is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination exists, the function returns 'YES'. If no valid combination is found, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range, returning 'NO' for any `n` that is not within 1 to 10^9 (inclusive).
