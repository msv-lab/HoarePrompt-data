Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`; `b` is incremented by 1; if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` equals 0, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no change to the variables' states.***
