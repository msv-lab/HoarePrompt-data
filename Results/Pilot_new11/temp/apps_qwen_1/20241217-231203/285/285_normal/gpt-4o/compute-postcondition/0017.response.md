Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that it must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \). The variables `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` equals 0, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken and the variables retain their pre-execution states.***
