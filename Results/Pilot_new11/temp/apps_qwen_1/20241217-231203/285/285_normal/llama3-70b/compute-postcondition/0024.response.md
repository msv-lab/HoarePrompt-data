The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program. It does not modify any variables but ends the execution. Given this, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` must be such that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` is non-negative, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, the equation `(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234)` equals `n`, and the console outputs 'YES'**
