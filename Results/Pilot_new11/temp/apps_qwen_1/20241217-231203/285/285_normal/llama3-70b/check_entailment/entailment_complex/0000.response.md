Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, ensuring it falls within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). This is handled correctly by using `int(input())`.

2. **Iterative Search for Solution**: The program uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
   - \(0 \leq a \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{1234567} \right\rfloor \)
   - \(0 \leq b \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n - a \times 1234567}{123456} \right\rfloor \)
   - \(0 \leq c \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456}{1234} \right\rfloor \)

3. **Checking the Equation**: For each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the program checks if the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\) holds true. If it does, the program prints "YES" and exits immediately using `exit()`.

4. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, the program prints "NO".

The logic ensures that the program exhaustively searches for any combination of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfy the equation, which matches the problem description. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality and thus is correct.
