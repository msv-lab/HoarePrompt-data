The code `print('YES')` does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. It only prints 'YES' to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`a` must be such that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` is non-negative, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, the equation `(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234)` equals `n`, and the console outputs 'YES'**
