The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables but simply prints 'YES' to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is \( b + 1 \); `c` is \( (n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234 \); printed text is 'YES'**
