Functionality: **The function accepts two inputs: an integer `n` representing the number of items, and an integer `L` representing the target volume. It also takes a list `c` of `n` integers, where each integer represents the volume capacity of an item. The function calculates the minimum cost to achieve the target volume `L` using the given items. If it is impossible to achieve the target volume, it returns -1. The function reads the values of `n`, `L`, and the list `c` from standard input. The function constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i`. After executing the function, the program prints the value of `dp[L]` if it is finite, otherwise, it prints -1. Potential edge cases include when `L` is 0 (where no items are needed and the cost is 0) or when the input does not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., `n` or `L` are out of bounds).**
