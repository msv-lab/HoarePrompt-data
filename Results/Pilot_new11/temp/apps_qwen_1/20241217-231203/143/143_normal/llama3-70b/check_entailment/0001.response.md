Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade by considering all possible bottle types and their volumes. The program initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` liters of lemonade. It iterates through each possible volume of lemonade that can be bought with the available bottle types and updates the DP array accordingly. Finally, it outputs the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade.

The program handles all the given examples correctly and seems to cover all potential cases within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
