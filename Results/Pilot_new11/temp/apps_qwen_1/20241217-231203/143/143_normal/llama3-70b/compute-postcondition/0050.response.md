The code snippet checks if the value of `dp[L]` is not infinity (`float('inf')`). If it is not infinity, it prints `dp[L]`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. The values of `n`, `L`, `c`, `costs`, and `dp` are not changed by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the output, which depends on the value of `dp[L]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items, and the output is `dp[L]` if `dp[L]` is not `float('inf')` else `-1`.**
