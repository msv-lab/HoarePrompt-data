`n` and `L` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `L` are now specific integers within the given ranges, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state. The list `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**
