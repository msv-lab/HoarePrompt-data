The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol`. Given that `j` is initially 1, `2 ** j` is `2 ** 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `vol` is updated to `2 - 1`, which is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items; `j` is 1; `i` is 4; `vol` is 1**
