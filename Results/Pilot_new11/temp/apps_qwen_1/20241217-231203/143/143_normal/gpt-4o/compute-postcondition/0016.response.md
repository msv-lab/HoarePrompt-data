Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State
- \( i \) is \( n-1 \)
- \( dp[0] \) is the minimum of the original \( dp[0] \) and \( c[0] \)
- \( dp[1] \) is the minimum of the original \( dp[1] \) and \( c[1] \)
- ...
- \( dp[n-1] \) is the minimum of the original \( dp[n-1] \) and \( c[n-1] \)
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \)

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, 31):
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**: Initially, \( i \) starts at \( n-1 \). The loop will run from \( i = 1 \) to \( i = 30 \).

2. **First Iteration** (\( i = 1 \)):
   - \( dp[1] \) is updated to \( \min(dp[1], dp[0] \times 2) \).
   
3. **Second Iteration** (\( i = 2 \)):
   - \( dp[2] \) is updated to \( \min(dp[2], dp[1] \times 2) \).
   - This means \( dp[2] \) now considers the previous value of \( dp[1] \) which was updated in the first iteration.

4. **General Iteration** (\( i = k \) where \( k \) ranges from 2 to 30):
   - \( dp[k] \) is updated to \( \min(dp[k], dp[k-1] \times 2) \).
   - Each subsequent \( dp[k] \) depends on the previously updated \( dp[k-1] \).

5. **Final Iteration** (\( i = 30 \)):
   - \( dp[30] \) is updated to \( \min(dp[30], dp[29] \times 2) \).
   - By the end of the loop, every \( dp[i] \) for \( i \) from 1 to 30 will have been updated based on the cumulative effect of the previous values.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes all 30 iterations, the values of \( dp[i] \) will reflect the minimum between the original \( dp[i] \) and \( 2^k \times \text{original\_dp[0]} \), where \( k \) is the number of steps taken to reach \( dp[i] \) from \( dp[0] \).

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all 30 times is:

Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, ..., `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`, `dp[i]` for \( i \) from 1 to 30 is updated to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and \( 2^{(i-1)} \times \text{original\_dp[0]} \)**
