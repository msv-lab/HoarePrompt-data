Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`; `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`; ...; `dp[n-1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[n-1]` and `c[n-1]`; `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
- For each iteration, the loop updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`.
- After `n` iterations, `dp[i]` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` will be the minimum of the original `dp[i]` and `c[i]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0):
- `i` remains 0 (though it won't be updated).
- `dp` remains unchanged, initialized to 10 for all indices.

Since the loop always initializes `dp` to 10 and updates it to the minimum of itself and `c[i]`, after `n` iterations, `dp[i]` for `i` in `[0, n-1]` will be the minimum of the original `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. The values of other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, and `max_cost`) do not change within the loop and retain their initial values.
