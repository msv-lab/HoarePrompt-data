The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type, and \(1 \leq \text{costs}[i] \leq 10^9\).

The function returns the minimum value of:
- `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0`.
- `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L \geq 1 << i`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs` and return the minimum value based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs`, and returns the minimum value of `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0` and `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L \geq 1 << i`.**
