The code snippet `L -= 1 << i` modifies the value of `L` by subtracting \(2^i\) from it, where `i` is 30. Since the initial state is given and we know that `i` is 30, we can calculate the new value of `L`.

- Initially, \(L \geq 1 \ll 30\), meaning \(L\) is at least \(2^{30}\).
- After the operation, `L` is reduced by \(2^{30}\).

Therefore, the new value of `L` is \(L - 2^{30}\).

The states of the other variables (`i`, `dp[30]`, `current_cost`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`, `current_cost` is `dp[30]`, and `L` is `L - 2^30`.**
