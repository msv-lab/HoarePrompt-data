The code appends `max_cost` to the `costs` list until the length of the `costs` list is 31. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9
- `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9)
- `max_cost` is 10
- `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each initialized to 10

After executing the line `c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))`, the `costs` list is extended by appending `max_cost` (which is 10) to it until its length reaches 31. Therefore, `costs` will now have exactly 31 elements.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of 31 elements, each representing the cost of a bottle of a specific type where the first `n` elements are the original costs and the remaining `31 - n` elements are 10, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each initialized to 10**
