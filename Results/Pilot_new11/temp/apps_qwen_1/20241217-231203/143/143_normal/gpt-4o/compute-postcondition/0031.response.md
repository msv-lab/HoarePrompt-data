The code snippet `current_cost += dp[i]` increments the value of `current_cost` by `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 28, `dp[i]` refers to `dp[28]`.

In the initial state:
- `i` is 28
- `dp[28]` is the minimum of the original `dp[28]` and `c[28]`
- `current_cost` is either `2 * dp[28]` or `dp[28]` depending on the condition in the if part
- `L` is `L_initial - 2^28` if `L_initial >= 2^28` or 0 otherwise
- `answer` is the minimum of the current `answer` and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`

After executing the code snippet `current_cost += dp[i]`:
- `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + dp[28]`

Therefore, the updated value of `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`.

Output State: **`i` is 28; `dp[28]` is the minimum of the original `dp[28]` and `c[28]`; `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`; `L` is `L_initial - 2^28` if `L_initial >= 2^28` or 0 otherwise; `answer` is the minimum of the current `answer` and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`.**
