Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the `func_1` function does not accurately reflect the problem statement. The function aims to minimize the cost of buying lemonade bottles to meet or exceed the required liters `L`. However, the logic for updating the `dp` array is flawed.

The `dp` array is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to achieve a certain volume of lemonade, but the way it is updated does not correctly handle the different bottle sizes and their respective costs. The key issue lies in the way the function handles the transition from one bottle size to the next. The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` incorrectly assumes that doubling the previous entry (`dp[i - 1]`) is the best way to update the cost for the current volume. This assumption is not always true and can lead to suboptimal solutions.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- Input: `n = 3`, `L = 5`, `costs = [10, 20, 30]`
- The optimal solution would be to buy one 4-liter bottle (costing 20 roubles) and one 1-liter bottle (costing 10 roubles), totaling 30 roubles.
- However, the current implementation might choose to buy two 2-liter bottles (each costing 10 roubles), totaling 20 roubles, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost for the given problem, and thus the Correctness is **False**.
