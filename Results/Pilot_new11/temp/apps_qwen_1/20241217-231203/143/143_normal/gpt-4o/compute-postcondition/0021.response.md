The code updates the `current_cost` by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 30, the value added to `current_cost` is `dp[30]`.

Let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `i` is 30.
- `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`.
- `current_cost` is 0.

After executing `current_cost += dp[i]`, the value of `current_cost` becomes `dp[30]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`, `current_cost` is `dp[30]`, and the condition \( L \geq 1 \ll i \) (where \( i = 30 \)) is true.**
