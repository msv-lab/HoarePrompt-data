Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code fails to consider the possibility of buying multiple bottles of the same type to meet the required volume. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` assumes that the optimal solution can be built by doubling the previous quantity and adding the cost of the next largest bottle, which does not account for scenarios where it might be more cost-effective to buy additional smaller bottles to reach the exact required volume.

For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
4 3
10 100 1000 10000
```

The correct output should be 30, as buying three 1-liter bottles at 10 roubles each is the most cost-effective way to get exactly 3 liters. However, the provided code would incorrectly output 100, which is the cost of the smallest bottle (1 liter).

The code needs to consider all possible combinations of bottles to ensure the minimum cost is found, not just the doubling strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this and similar cases.
