Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations since `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
   - `L` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
   - `costs` is a list of 31 elements, where the first `n` elements represent the original costs, and the remaining `31 - n` elements are 10.
   - `max_cost` is 10.
   - `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each initialized to 10.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` in each iteration.
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - `i` should increment by 1 after each iteration but must stay within the range `[0, n-1]`.

5. **Summary of Adjusted States:**
   - `i` must be set to 0.
   - `n` remains as given (it is already a positive integer between 1 and 30).
   - No changes are needed for `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, or `dp` because they are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization of `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30**
