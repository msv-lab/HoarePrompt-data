Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`
   - `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`
   - ...
   - `dp[n-1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[n-1]` and `c[n-1]`
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 30`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` (which is `n-1`) must be within the range specified by the loop condition.

4. **Checking the Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and ends with `i = 30`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (`n-1`) must be at least 1 but less than or equal to 30.

5. **Final Value of `i` After the Loop**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `30`, after the loop completes, `i` will be `30`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n-1` is at least 1 (i.e., `n` must be at least 2) and the loop will run as expected.
   - After the loop, `i` should be 30.

Based on this analysis, the required states to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure `i` (`n-1`) is at least 1.
- `i` should be adjusted to be 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, ..., `dp[n-1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[n-1]` and `c[n-1]`**.
