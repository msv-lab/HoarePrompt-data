Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case where the required liters `L` is exactly equal to the sum of the volumes of two different bottle types, but buying them separately would cost more than buying a larger bottle type that covers the same volume.

Consider the following input:
```
4 3
10 100 1000 10000
```

- The required liters `L` is 3.
- The costs are `[10, 100, 1000, 10000]`.

According to the problem description, the optimal solution would be to buy a 1-liter bottle for 10 roubles and a 2-liter bottle for 100 roubles, which totals 110 roubles. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 30 roubles (three 1-liter bottles).

The issue lies in how the dynamic programming approach handles the selection of bottle types. The program assumes that buying the largest possible bottle type first is always optimal, but it does not properly consider the combination of smaller bottle types that might yield a better cost for the exact required volume.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check combinations of smaller bottle types to ensure the minimum cost is found.
