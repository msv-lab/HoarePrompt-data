Postcondition: **`position` is 0 or 20000, `t` is the value of `t`, `dir` is the value of `dir`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `valid` is True, `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'South', and the current value of `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'**
