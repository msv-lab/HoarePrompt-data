`t` is assigned the value of the first word from the input split by space, and `dir` is assigned the value of the second word from the same input. The value of `position`, `n`, `valid`, and `t` (the second part of the split input) changes. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is the second word from the input**
