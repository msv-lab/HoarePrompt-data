`valid` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer representation of the second word from the input**
