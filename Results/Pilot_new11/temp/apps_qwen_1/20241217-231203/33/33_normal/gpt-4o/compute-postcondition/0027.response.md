Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `valid` is False, and `t` is an integer. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `position` is set to `t`, `dir` is set to its original value, `n` remains unchanged, and `valid` is False. If `position` is within the range [0, 20000], `position` remains unchanged, `dir` is set to its original value, `n` remains unchanged, and `valid` is still False.***
