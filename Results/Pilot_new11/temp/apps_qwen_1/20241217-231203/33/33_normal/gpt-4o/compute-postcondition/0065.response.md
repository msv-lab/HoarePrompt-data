The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or their values; it only prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 (inclusive), `dir` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `n` is 0, `valid` is True, and `t` is an integer; if `position` is not 0, `valid` is set to False.**
