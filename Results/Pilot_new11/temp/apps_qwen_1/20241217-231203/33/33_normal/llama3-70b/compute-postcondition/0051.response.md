The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables, but it does indicate that the program has reached this point and has printed 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is its initial state plus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is its initial state minus `t / 111.195`. In any other case, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state. `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space. The program has printed 'NO' to the console.**
