The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program. This means that any changes made to variables during the execution will not be retained, and the program will end immediately without further execution of the subsequent code. Given the initial state where `n` is at least 1 and `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction `dir`, the program will simply exit without performing any updates to these variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, and `curr_lat` remains within its initial state since no changes are applied due to the program exiting.**
