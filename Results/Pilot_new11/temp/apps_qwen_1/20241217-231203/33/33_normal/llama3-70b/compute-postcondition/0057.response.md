The code `print('NO')` simply prints 'NO' to the console and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir` (unless `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'), `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space. The program prints 'NO' to the console and terminates.**
