Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of moves `n` and then processes each move one by one. It ensures that the input is handled as per the constraints specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6).

2. **Latitude Calculation**: The program calculates the current latitude after each move. It uses a conversion factor (`111.195`) to convert kilometers to degrees, which is a reasonable approximation given the problem’s context. This factor is used to maintain consistency with the problem’s assumptions about the Earth’s circumference.

3. **Direction Validation**:
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat = 90`), the program only allows moves in the "South" direction.
   - If Limak is at the South Pole (`curr_lat = -90`), the program only allows moves in the "North" direction.
   - The program checks these conditions at each step and prints "NO" immediately if any condition is violated.

4. **Final Position Check**: After processing all moves, the program checks if Limak ends up at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as reaching the poles and ensuring the directions are valid at those points. It also ensures that the final position is the North Pole.

Given these points, the program correctly validates the conditions described in the problem statement for all possible inputs, making it **correct**.
