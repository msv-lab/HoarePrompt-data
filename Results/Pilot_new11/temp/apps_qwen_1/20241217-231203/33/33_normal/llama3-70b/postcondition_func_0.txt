The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and updates the current latitude accordingly. It ensures that the latitude remains within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the latitude reaches -90, the next movement must be North; if it reaches 90, the next movement must be South. If any movement results in the latitude exceeding the valid range or violates the above rules, the function prints 'NO' and exits. After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
