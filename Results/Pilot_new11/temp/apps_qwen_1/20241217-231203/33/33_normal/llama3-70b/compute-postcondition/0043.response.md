According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is at least 1, and `curr_lat` remains within its initial state. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be at least 1.

Since the loop variable `_` is just an iterator and does not affect the state, we only need to consider the conditions involving `n` and `curr_lat`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must still be at least 1.
- `curr_lat` remains within its initial state.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state**
