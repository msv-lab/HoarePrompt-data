The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.**
