Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range [1, 10^9] and returns the count of its divisors. It achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to zero and an index `i` to 1. The function then iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to the square root of `num`. For each value of `i`, if `i` divides `num` without a remainder, it increments the `count` by 1. If `i` is not equal to `num // i`, it also increments the `count` by 1 to account for the corresponding divisor greater than `i`. After the loop completes, the function returns the total count of divisors. Potential edge cases include when `num` is a perfect square, where the square root of `num` would be counted twice unless handled properly, but the code correctly handles this by ensuring `i` is not equal to `num // i`.**
