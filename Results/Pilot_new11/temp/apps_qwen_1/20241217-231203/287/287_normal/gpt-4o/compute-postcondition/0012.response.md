`count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is either 2 or 3, so after incrementing, `count` will be 3 or 4. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 3 or 4, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 3 or 4, and `i` is 2**
