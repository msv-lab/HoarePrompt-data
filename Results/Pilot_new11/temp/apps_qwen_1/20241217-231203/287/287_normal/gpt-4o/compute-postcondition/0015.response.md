The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, after executing this line, `i` becomes 3. The values of `num` and `count` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `count` is either 3 or 4, and `i` is 3.**
