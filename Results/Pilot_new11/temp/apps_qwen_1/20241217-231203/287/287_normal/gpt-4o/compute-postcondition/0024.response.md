The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9. The function returns `count`, which is the number of divisors of `num`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `num` within the range [1, 10^9] and return the count of its divisors.
