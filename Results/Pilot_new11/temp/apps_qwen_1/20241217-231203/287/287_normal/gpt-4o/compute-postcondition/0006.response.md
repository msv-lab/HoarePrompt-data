`count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is 2. The other variables (`num` and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition `i != num // i` still holds true because the operation only affects `count`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`. The condition `i != num // i` holds true.**
