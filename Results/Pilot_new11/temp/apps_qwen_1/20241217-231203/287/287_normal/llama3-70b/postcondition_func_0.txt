The function calculates the number of divisors of a given integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)), and if \( n \) is a perfect square, it subtracts one from the count. Specifically, for each divisor \( i \) of \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n} \)), it increments the result by 2. If \( i \times i = n \), it decrements the result by 1 to adjust for the double counting of the square root. The function then prints the final count of divisors.
