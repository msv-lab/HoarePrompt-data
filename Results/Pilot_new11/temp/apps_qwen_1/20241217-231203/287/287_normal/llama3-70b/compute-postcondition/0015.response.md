`res` is incremented by 2. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `k + 1`. The initial value of `res` is 1 if `n` is not 4. After executing `res += 2`, the value of `res` changes to `1 + 2` which is 3 if `n` is not 4, and remains 1 if `n` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `res` is 3 if `n` is not 4 and 1 if `n` is 4**
