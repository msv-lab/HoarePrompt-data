To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step by step based on its code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis

**Loop Code:**
```python
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        res += 2
    if i * i == n:
        res -= 1
```

- **Variable `i`:** The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
- **Condition `n % i == 0`:** If `i` is a divisor of `n`, `res` is incremented by 2.
- **Condition `i * i == n`:** If `i` is a perfect square root of `n`, `res` is decremented by 1.

### Understanding the Logic

1. **Incrementing `res` by 2:** This happens for each divisor of `n` except when `i` is the square root of `n` (since we decrement by 1 in that case).

2. **Decrementing `res` by 1:** This happens only if `i` is exactly \(\sqrt{n}\), meaning `n` is a perfect square.

### Final State Determination

- **If `n` is not a perfect square:**
  - Each divisor `i` of `n` (excluding the square root) will contribute 2 to `res`.
  - The total contribution from divisors is \(2 \times (\text{number of divisors}) - 1\) (since the square root is counted only once in the divisors but subtracted once in the loop).
  - Therefore, `res = 2 \times d(n) - 1`, where \(d(n)\) is the number of divisors of `n`.

- **If `n` is a perfect square:**
  - Each divisor `i` of `n` (including the square root) will contribute 2 to `res`.
  - However, since the square root is counted twice (once in the divisors and once in the subtraction), `res = 2 \times d(n) - 1 + 1 = 2 \times d(n)`.

### Output State

- **General Case:**
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `res` is calculated as follows:
    - If `n` is not a perfect square: `res = 2 \times d(n) - 1`.
    - If `n` is a perfect square: `res = 2 \times d(n)`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `res` is the sum of 2 for each divisor of `n`, adjusted by subtracting 1 if `n` is a perfect square.**
