Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number \( n \). However, the code instead calculates the number of divisors of \( n \).

For instance, for \( n = 7 \):
- The correct answer should be 4 (weights: 1, 2, 3, 7).
- The code incorrectly outputs 4 because it counts the divisors of 7, which are 1 and 7.

Similarly, for \( n = 8 \):
- The correct answer should be 5 (weights: 1, 2, 4, 8).
- The code incorrectly outputs 5 because it counts the divisors of 8, which are 1, 2, and 4.

The code does not account for the different weights of splits, but rather simply counts the divisors of the given number. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
