`res` is incremented by 2. The value of `n` being greater than or equal to 1 and the existence of an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `res` is `res` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 2, there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0`**
