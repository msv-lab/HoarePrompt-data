The code `print(years)` simply prints the value of the `years` variable. Since no operation changes the value of `years`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information that needs to be included in the output state is the value of `years`.

Output State: **`a` is a power of 3 up to 27; `b` is a power of 2 up to 16; `years` is the number of iterations the loop executed.**
