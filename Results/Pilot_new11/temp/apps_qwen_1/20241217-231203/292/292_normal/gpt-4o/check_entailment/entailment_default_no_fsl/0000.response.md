Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's. The number of years required for this condition to be met is counted and printed. The code handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), ensuring that Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight after the correct number of years. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
