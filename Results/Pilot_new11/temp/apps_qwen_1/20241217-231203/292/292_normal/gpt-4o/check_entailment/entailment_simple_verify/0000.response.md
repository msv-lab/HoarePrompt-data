Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The annotations provide clear insights into the state of the program at different points, indicating that Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's, and the number of years required is counted. The program handles all given examples and the described logic accurately, making the original assessment of correctness accurate.
