Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two positive integers `a` and `b` from the standard input, ensuring they satisfy the condition \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).

2. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a while loop to repeatedly triple `a` and double `b` until `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. The variable `years` keeps track of the number of iterations.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `a` exceeds `b`, meaning Limak (represented by `a`) has become strictly larger than Bob (represented by `b`).

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years (`years`) required for this condition to be met.

Given these points, the program correctly simulates the process of Limak becoming larger than Bob by tripling his weight and doubling Bob's weight each year until `a` exceeds `b`. The program also handles all valid cases within the specified constraints and does not rely on any assumptions beyond the provided problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
