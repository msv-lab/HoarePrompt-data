Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The program counts the number of years required and prints the result. Since the program handles all given examples and the described logic accurately, it is correct for every potential case within the specified constraints.
