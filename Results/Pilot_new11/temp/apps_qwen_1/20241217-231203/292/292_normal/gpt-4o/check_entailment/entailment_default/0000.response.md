Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. It then enters a loop where Limak's weight (`a`) is tripled and Bob's weight (`b`) is doubled in each iteration until `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. The number of iterations (years) is counted and printed at the end.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, multiplying `a` by 3 and `b` by 2 in each iteration until `a` exceeds `b`. The function handles all potential cases within the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\) and ensures that Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's weight.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the code correctly computes the number of years needed for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. There are no edge cases or examples provided that the code does not handle correctly within the given constraints.
