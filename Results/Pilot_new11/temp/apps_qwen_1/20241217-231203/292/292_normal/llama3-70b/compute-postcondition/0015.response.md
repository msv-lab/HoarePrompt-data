The code `print(years)` simply prints the value of the variable `years`. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code, and their values remain unchanged. The value of `years` is printed but not updated or reassigned. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement's effect.

Output State: **`a` is between 3 years and 30 years, `b` is between 2 years and 20 years, `years` is the number of times the loop executed, and the value of `years` is printed.**
