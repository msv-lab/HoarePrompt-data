`a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is between 9 and 90 inclusive, multiplying it by 3 will result in `a` being between 27 and 270 inclusive. However, the condition that `a` must be less than or equal to `b` still holds. The value of `b` remains between 4 and 40 inclusive.

Output State: **`a` is between 27 and 270 inclusive; `b` is between 4 and 40 inclusive; `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
