Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted based on their counts in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2. If the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are the same and their count is `n // 2`, the program prints these two elements. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
