The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the output includes 'YES'. However, since the task requires updating the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and no variables are changed, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted based on their counts in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2. The current value of `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is equal to `n // 2` and the current value of `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is equal to `n // 2`. A value 'YES' is printed to the console.**
