Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if Petya and Vasya can choose numbers to make the game fair. Specifically, the program fails to check if there are at least two different numbers with exactly `n/2` occurrences, which is a necessary condition for the game to be fair. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4
1
2
2
1
```

In this case, both `1` and `2` appear twice, so it should be possible for Petya and Vasya to choose `1` and `2` respectively, making the game fair. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `NO` because it checks the last two unique numbers' counts and finds that they are the same, failing to account for the fact that both `1` and `2` can be chosen to make the game fair.

To fix this, the program should check all unique numbers and ensure there are at least two different numbers with exactly `n/2` occurrences. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    # Find all unique numbers with exactly n//2 occurrences
    fair_numbers = [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == n // 2]
    
    if len(fair_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(fair_numbers[0], fair_numbers[1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the game can only be declared fair if there are at least two different numbers with exactly `n/2` occurrences, thereby meeting the problem description for all potential cases.
