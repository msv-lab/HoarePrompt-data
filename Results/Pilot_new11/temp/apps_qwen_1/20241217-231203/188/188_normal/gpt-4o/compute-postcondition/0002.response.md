The `Counter` function from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each element in the `cards` list. After executing this line, `count` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements in `cards` and the values are the counts of those elements. The initial state of `n` being an even integer and `cards` being a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`.**
