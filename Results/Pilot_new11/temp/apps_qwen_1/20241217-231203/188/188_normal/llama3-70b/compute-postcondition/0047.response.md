The code assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. The value of `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`. Since `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, the value of `a2` will be the next key from `d` after the current value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` after the current value of `i`, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.**
