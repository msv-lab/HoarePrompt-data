The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d` initially contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, this operation will increment the value of `d[i]` from `1` to `2`. The variables `a` and `n` are not affected by this operation. The variable `i` is also not directly modified by this line of code; it is simply referenced.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary with the key-value pair `{i: 2}`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
