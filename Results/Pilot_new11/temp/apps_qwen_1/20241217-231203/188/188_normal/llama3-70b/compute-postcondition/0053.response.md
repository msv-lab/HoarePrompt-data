The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or their values; it simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the program will print 'YES', but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, and the condition `(a1 != -1 and a2 != -1)` is true, and the program prints 'YES'**.
