`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The length of the list of integers representing the numbers on the cards must still be `n`, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **The input is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, with the length of the list being an even number `n` (2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive; `n` is the integer value entered by the user.**
