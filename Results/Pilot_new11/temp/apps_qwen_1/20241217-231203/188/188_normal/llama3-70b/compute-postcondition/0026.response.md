The code initializes two variables `a1` and `a2` to `-1`. The values of these variables are directly set to `-1`, and there is no impact on the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
