Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list containing two elements `[original_element, input_int]`.
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to continue, `i < n-1` must hold true.
   - Therefore, `n-1 > 6` or equivalently `n > 7`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `a` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` increases by 1 from 6 to 7.
   - `n` must still be an even number between 2 and 100, but now it must be greater than 7.

6. **Final State:**
   - `a` is a list containing two elements `[original_element, input_int]`.
   - `i` is 7.
   - `n` must be an even number between 8 and 100 (since `n` must be greater than 7 and still within the given range).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list containing two elements `[original_element, input_int]`, `i` is 7, `n` must be an even number between 8 and 100**.
