The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables `a`, `d`, `c`, `a1`, or `a2`. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is either -1 or not set because there is no element in `a` whose count is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or not set because there is no element in `a` whose count is not equal to `n // 2`, and the string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
