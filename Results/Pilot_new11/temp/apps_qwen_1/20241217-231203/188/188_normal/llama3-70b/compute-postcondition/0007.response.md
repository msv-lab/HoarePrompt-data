The code appends an integer input to the list `a`. Since the initial state of `a` is `[original_element, input_int]`, after appending, `a` will be `[original_element, input_int, int(input())]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 7, and the value of `n` is still an even number between 8 and 100, but its specific value is not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`a` is `[original_element, input_int, int(input())]`, `i` is 7, `n` is an even number between 8 and 100**
