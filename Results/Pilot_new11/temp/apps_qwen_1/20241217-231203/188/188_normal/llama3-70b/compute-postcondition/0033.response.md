The code assigns the value of `i` (which is an element in the list `a`) to `a2`. Since `i` is an element in the list `a` and there is at least one element in `a` whose count of occurrences is not equal to `n // 2`, the value of `a2` is set to such an element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is -1, `a2` is the value of `i` (an element from the list `a`), where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`.**
