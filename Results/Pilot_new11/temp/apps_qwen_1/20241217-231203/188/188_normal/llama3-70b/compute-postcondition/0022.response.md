`d[i]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary. The length of the list `a` (`n`) remains unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `d` is a dictionary, and `d[i] = 1`**
