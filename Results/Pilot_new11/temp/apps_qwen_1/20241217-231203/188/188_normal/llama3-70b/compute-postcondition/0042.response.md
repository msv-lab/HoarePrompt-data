Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`. `c` is either 1 or 2, depending on the condition. If `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d`, and `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1. If `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is the same as `a1`. `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.***
