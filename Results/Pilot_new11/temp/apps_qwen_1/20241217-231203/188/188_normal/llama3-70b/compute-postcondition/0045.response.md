The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is the next key from the dictionary `d`) to the variable `a1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements.
- `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`.
- `c` is 2.
- `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, or `-1` if no such key exists.
- `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains `-1`.
- `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.

After the code execution, the only change is that `a1` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` (the next key from `d`), `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains `-1`, `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.**
