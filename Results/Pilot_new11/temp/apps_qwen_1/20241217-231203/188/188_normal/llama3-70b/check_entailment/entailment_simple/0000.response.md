Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Logic for Determining Fairness**: 
   - The problem requires determining if there are two different integers in the list such that each integer appears exactly `n // 2` times, ensuring that both players can take all cards equally.
   - The program checks if there are two keys in the dictionary `d` whose values are `n // 2`, indicating that each of these keys (integers) appears exactly half the total number of cards. However, the logic for this check is flawed.

2. **Flawed Logic in the For Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the dictionary `d` and checks if the count of each key (`d[i]`) equals `n // 2`. If it finds one key, it sets `a1` to that key and increments `c`. If it finds a second key, it sets `a2` to that key and breaks out of the loop.
   - This approach assumes that the first two keys found with counts of `n // 2` will be the only ones, but it doesn’t ensure that no other keys also meet this criterion. Moreover, it fails to consider cases where no such pair exists.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1** (Correct Case): 
     ```
     Input: 
     4
     11
     27
     27
     11
     Output:
     YES
     11 27
     ```
     - The program correctly identifies that `11` and `27` each appear twice (`n // 2`).

   - **Example 2** (Incorrect Case):
     ```
     Input:
     2
     6
     6
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     - The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the first two keys without ensuring no other keys match the criteria.

   - **Example 3** (Incorrect Case):
     ```
     Input:
     6
     10
     20
     30
     20
     10
     20
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     - The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it doesn't find a pair of keys that each appear exactly three times (`n // 2`).

   - **Example 4** (Incorrect Case):
     ```
     Input:
     6
     1
     1
     2
     2
     3
     3
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     - The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it doesn’t find a pair of keys that each appear three times (`n // 2`).

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that:
- There are exactly two distinct integers in the list that each appear `n // 2` times.
- You should check for the presence of exactly two such integers, ensuring no other integers meet this criterion.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if a1 == -1:
                a1 = i
            elif a2 == -1:
                a2 = i
            else:
                break
    
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1):
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the program properly checks for exactly two integers appearing `n // 2` times and handles the case where such a pair does not exist.
