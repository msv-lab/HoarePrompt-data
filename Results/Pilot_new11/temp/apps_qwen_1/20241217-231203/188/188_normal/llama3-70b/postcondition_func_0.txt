The function `func` accepts a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards. The length of the list is an even number \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function then checks if there are two distinct integers in the list that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If such integers exist, the function prints "YES" followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
