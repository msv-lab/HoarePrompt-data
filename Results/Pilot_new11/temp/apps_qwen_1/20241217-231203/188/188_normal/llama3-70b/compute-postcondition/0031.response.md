The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `a`, `d`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` is -1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` is -1**
