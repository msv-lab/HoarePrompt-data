`x` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This means `x` will be updated to a list of integers obtained from user input, split by spaces. The length of this list will be equal to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `y` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input, `y` is a list of `n` integers**
