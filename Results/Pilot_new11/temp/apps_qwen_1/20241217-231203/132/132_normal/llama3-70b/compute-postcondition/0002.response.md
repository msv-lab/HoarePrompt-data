The code snippet takes a list of `n` integers from user input and assigns it to the variable `y`. The variable `x` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input, and `y` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, the list `y` is updated to contain the integers from the user input, while `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input, `y` is a list of `n` integers from user input**
