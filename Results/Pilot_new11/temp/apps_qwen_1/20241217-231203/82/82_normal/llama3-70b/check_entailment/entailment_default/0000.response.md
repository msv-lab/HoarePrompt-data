Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code uses a brute-force approach to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. However, the approach is inefficient and does not guarantee finding the correct \( k \) in all cases.

The main issue is that the code increments \( k \) one by one and checks the LCM for each increment. This method is not optimal and may miss the smallest \( k \) that gives the minimum LCM. A more efficient approach would involve leveraging the properties of LCM and GCD.

Here is a more efficient solution:

```python
from math import gcd

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the difference between a and b
diff = abs(a - b)

# Calculate the GCD of a and b
gcd_ab = gcd(a, b)

# Find the smallest k
k = diff // gcd_ab * gcd_ab

# Ensure k is non-negative
k = max(k, 0)

print(k)
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Calculate the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \).
2. Compute the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \).
3. Determine the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM by using the formula derived from the properties of LCM and GCD.
4. Ensure \( k \) is non-negative.

This approach ensures that the correct \( k \) is found efficiently and in all cases, thus meeting the problem description.
