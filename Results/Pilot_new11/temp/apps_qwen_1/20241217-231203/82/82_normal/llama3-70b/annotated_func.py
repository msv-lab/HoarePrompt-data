#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`; `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function iteratively updates `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns `a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If either `a` or `b` is zero, the function still correctly calculates the GCD as follows:
   - If `a` is zero, the GCD is `b`.
   - If `b` is zero, the GCD is `a`.
2. The function handles the case where both `a` and `b` are within the specified range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) correctly.

After the function concludes, the variable `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is guaranteed to be zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of the function func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It calculates the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of calling another function `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a division by zero error since integer division by zero is undefined. If `a` and `b` are both non-zero and `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero, the function will return the integer division result.
