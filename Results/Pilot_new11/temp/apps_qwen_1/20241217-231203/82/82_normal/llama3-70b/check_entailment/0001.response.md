Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. However, these functions do not address the main problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. 

- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- `func_2` calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \).

These functions alone are not sufficient to solve the problem. The actual solution requires understanding the properties of LCM and GCD and how they relate to the given problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following approach:
1. The LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) can be written as \( \text{lcm}(a + k, b + k) = \frac{(a + k)(b + k)}{\text{gcd}(a + k, b + k)} \).
2. We need to minimize \( \text{lcm}(a + k, b + k) \), which means minimizing the numerator and maximizing the denominator.
3. By setting \( k = \text{abs}(a - b) \), we can ensure that \( \text{gcd}(a + k, b + k) \) is maximized because \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) will be multiples of \( |a - b| \).
4. If \( a = b \), then the LCM is minimized when \( k = 0 \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    else:
        return abs(a - b)

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(find_smallest_k(a, b))
```

This program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original program provided is incorrect.
