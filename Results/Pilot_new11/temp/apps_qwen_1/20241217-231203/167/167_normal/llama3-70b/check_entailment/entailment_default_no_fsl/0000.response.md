Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a critical flaw in how it determines the validity of the path. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells in the path. The condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1` should be `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1` to ensure that the move is exactly one step in the matrix. This error leads to incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output:
NO
```

The correct output should be `YES 3 3` because the path is valid in a 3x3 matrix. However, due to the incorrect distance check, the program incorrectly outputs `NO`.

To fix this, change the condition in `func_1` to:

```python
def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True
```

With this correction, the program should be able to correctly identify valid paths for the given problem description.
