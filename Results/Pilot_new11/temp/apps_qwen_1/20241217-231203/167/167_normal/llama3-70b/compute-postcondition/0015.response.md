Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\), `px` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `py` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\). If the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns no specific value as there is no else part that assigns a value to be returned.***
