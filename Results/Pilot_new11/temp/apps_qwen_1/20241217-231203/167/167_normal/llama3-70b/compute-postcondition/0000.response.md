The initial state is that `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). The matrix `A` is defined such that `A[i][j] = y*(i-1) + j` for every \(i \in [1..x]\) and \(j \in [1..y]\), and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` represents a valid path in this matrix. 

The given code snippet initializes two variables `px` and `py` to 0.

Impact of the code:
- `px` is assigned the value 0.
- `py` is assigned the value 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); the matrix `A` is defined such that `A[i][j] = y*(i-1) + j` for every \(i \in [1..x]\) and \(j \in [1..y]\); the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` represents a valid path in this matrix; `px` is 0; `py` is 0.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); the matrix `A` is defined such that `A[i][j] = y*(i-1) + j` for every \(i \in [1..x]\) and \(j \in [1..y]\); the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` represents a valid path in this matrix; `px` is 0; `py` is 0.**
