The code prints the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. However, these variables do not change their values after the print statement. Therefore, the output of the print statement does not affect the state of the variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n), `min_asked` is `max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1)), `sergei_asked` is `quotient + (\text{remainder} \geq n - x + 1)` where `quotient = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n)` and `remainder = (k + x - 1) \% (2 * n)`**
