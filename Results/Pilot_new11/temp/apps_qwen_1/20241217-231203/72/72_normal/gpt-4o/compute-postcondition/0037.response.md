The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state, `row` is initially `-1`. After adding 2 to `-1`, the new value of `row` will be `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `row` is 1, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `direction` is 1**
