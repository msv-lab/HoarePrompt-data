`max_questions` is incremented by 1, which means `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `row`, `sergei_questions`, and `direction`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `row` is equal to `x`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, otherwise remains unchanged, and `max_questions` is `max_questions + 1`.**
