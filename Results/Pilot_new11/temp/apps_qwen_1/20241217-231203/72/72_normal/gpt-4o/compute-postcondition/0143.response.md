The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `direction`. The other variables (`col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `row`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`col` is 1; `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0; `m` must still be greater than 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1; `row` is either `-1` or `1`; `direction` is `-1`.**
