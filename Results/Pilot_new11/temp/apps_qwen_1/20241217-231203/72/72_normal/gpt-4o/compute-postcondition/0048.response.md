`max_questions` is decremented by 1, meaning its value is reduced by 1. The states of the other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, `col`, and `sergei_questions`) remain unchanged based on the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
