`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. The condition for `direction` is not equal to 1 also remains valid.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, direction is not equal to 1, `max_questions` is reduced by 1**
