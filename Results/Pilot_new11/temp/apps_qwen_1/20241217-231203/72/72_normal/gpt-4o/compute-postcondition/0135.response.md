`row` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `row` was `-1`, so the new value of `row` is `-1 + 2`, which is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is equal to its initial value minus 1, the current value of `row` is `1`, `direction` is now `1`, and the current value of `row` is `1` and the current value of `col` is `y` since the condition `direction != 1` still holds true.**
