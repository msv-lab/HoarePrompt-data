The code changes the value of `direction` to 1. This affects the value of `direction`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. 

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, direction is 1, `max_questions` is reduced by 1, `row` is increased by `direction` (which is now 1). The current value of `row` is -1 + 1 = 0.**
