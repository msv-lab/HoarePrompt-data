`row` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `row` was increased by 2, so the new value of `row` is `row + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `row` is now `row + 2`, and `direction` is 1.**
