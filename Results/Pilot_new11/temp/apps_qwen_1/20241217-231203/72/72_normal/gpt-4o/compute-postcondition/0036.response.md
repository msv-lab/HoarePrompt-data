The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `direction`. This is the only change made to the program. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 0, the current value of `row` is `x + direction` and it is equal to -1, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `direction` is 1.
