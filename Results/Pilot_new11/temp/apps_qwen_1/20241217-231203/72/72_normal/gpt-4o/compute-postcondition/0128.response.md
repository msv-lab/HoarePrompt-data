The code `row -= 2` decreases the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state, `row` equals `n`, and since `n` is `row - 1`, initially `n` is `col - 1`. Therefore, `row` is `col - 1`. After executing `row -= 2`, the new value of `row` will be `(col - 1) - 2 = col - 3`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `col` is 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; the current value of `n` is `col - 3`; `direction` is -1; and `row` equals `col - 3`.**
