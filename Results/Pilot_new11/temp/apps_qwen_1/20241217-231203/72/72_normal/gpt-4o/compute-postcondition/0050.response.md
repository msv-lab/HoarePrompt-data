`direction` is assigned the value `1`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables, but it sets the direction to 1, which will be used in the next steps (not specified in this code snippet).

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `row` is increased by `direction`, and `direction` is 1.**
