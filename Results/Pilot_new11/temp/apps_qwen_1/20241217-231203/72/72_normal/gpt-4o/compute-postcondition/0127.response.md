The code changes the value of `direction` to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value for `direction` is `-1`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `col` is 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; the current value of `n` is `row - 1`; `direction` is -1; and `row` equals `n`.**
