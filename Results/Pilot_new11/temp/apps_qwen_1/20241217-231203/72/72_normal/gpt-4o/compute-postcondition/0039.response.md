Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 0. If `direction == 1`, then `row` is `n - 2`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, otherwise remains unchanged, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is set to -1. If `direction != 1`, then `row` is either 1 or -1, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is decremented by 1, and if `row` equals -1, it is set to 1. Otherwise, `row` remains -1.***
