The code `row -= 2` subtracts 2 from the current value of `row`. Given the initial state where `row` is either `-1` or `1`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `row` is `-1`, then `row -= 2` results in `-1 - 2 = -3`.
2. If `row` is `1`, then `row -= 2` results in `1 - 2 = -1`.

In both cases, the value of `row` changes, but the conditions that `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0 and `m` must still be greater than 0 remain unchanged. Additionally, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` each increase by 1, and `direction` remains `-1`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `row` is either `-3` or `-1` depending on its initial value.
- `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1.
- `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1.
- All other variables (`col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, and `direction`) retain their original conditions or values.

Output State: **`col` is 1; `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0; `m` must still be greater than 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1; `row` is either `-3` or `-1`; `direction` is `-1`.**
