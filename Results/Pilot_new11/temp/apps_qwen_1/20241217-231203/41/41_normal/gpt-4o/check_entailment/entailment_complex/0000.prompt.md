You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of round participants. Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) representing the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`. For every tuple in `ratings`, `a` and `b` are distinct integers unless the loop did not execute at all, in which case `ratings` remains an empty list and `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remain their original values.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`. If the loop executes, `i` will be `n`, and the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will never be met during the loop iterations. If the loop does not execute, `ratings` remains an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `True`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `True`. If the loop does not execute, `ratings` remains an empty list. If the loop executes, `i` will be `n`, and the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will never be met during the loop iterations.
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`. If `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_unrated` remains `True`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` becomes `False` and `ratings` remains an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b). If `is_rated` is `True`, then `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, and the value printed is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` remains `False`. The state of `ratings` depends on whether the loop executes: if the loop does not execute, `ratings` remains an empty list; if the loop executes, the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will never be met, and `ratings` remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data consisting of `n` participants' ratings before and after a round. It initializes two flags, `is_rated` and `is_unrated`, to track whether any participant's rating changed and whether the ratings are in non-decreasing order. After processing the ratings, it prints one of three possible outcomes: 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe'. The function determines the outcome based on the following criteria:
- If any participant's rating changed (`is_rated` is `True`), it prints 'rated'.
- If no participant's rating changed (`is_rated` is `False`) and the ratings are in non-decreasing order (`is_unrated` is `True`), it prints 'unrated'.
- If no participant's rating changed (`is_rated` is `False`) and the ratings are not in non-decreasing order (`is_unrated` is `False`), it prints 'maybe'.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input `n` is less than 2, the function will still process the input as if `n` were 2, but the loop will not execute, keeping `ratings` an empty list and `is_rated` and `is_unrated` in their initial states.
- The function assumes that the ratings are valid integers within the given range, but no validation is performed on the input data.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
