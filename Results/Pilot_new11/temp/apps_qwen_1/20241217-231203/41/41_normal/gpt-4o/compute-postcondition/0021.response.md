Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`. The `ratings` list remains an empty list if the loop did not execute at all, otherwise, it contains tuples with distinct integers `a` and `b`.**
