Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 2. If `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the conditions and states remain as they are if the if condition is not met.***
