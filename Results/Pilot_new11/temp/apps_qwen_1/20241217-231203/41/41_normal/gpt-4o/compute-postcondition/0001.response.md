The code initializes an empty list named `ratings`. It does not assign any values to `ratings` directly but prepares to read inputs for `a_i` and `b_i` for each participant. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `a_i` and `b_i` will be read subsequently, but their values are not set yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list**
