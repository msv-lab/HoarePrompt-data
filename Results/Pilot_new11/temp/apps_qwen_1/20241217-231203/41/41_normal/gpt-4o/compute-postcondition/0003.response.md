The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of `n`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is `False`; `is_unrated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is `False`; `is_unrated` is `False`**
