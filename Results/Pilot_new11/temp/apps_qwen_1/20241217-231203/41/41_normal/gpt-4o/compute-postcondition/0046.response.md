The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it processes data from an input stream where the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of round participants. Following this, there are `n` lines, each containing two integers `a_{i}` and `b_{i}` (1 ≤ `a_{i}`, `b_{i}` ≤ 4126) representing the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively.

Based on the given information, the function does not explicitly return a value in the described format. However, considering the task involves processing the input and potentially performing some operations based on the ratings, we can summarize the function's expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function processes data consisting of `n` participants' ratings before and after a round, where `n` is specified in the first line of input. For each participant, it takes two integers representing the rating before and after the round, and then performs unspecified operations based on these ratings.**
