`ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. After appending, the `ratings` list contains `[a, b]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ratings` is ['a', 'b'], `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
