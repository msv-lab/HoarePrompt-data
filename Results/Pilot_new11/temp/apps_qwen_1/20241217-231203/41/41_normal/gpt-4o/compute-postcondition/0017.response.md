The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. Initially, `ratings` is `['a', 'b', (a, b)]`. After appending `(a, b)`, `ratings` becomes `['a', 'b', (a, b), (a, b)]`.

The values of `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ratings` is ['a', 'b', (a, b), (a, b)], `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False**
