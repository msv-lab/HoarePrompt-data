Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b). If `is_rated` is `True`, then `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, and the value printed is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` remains `False`. The state of `ratings` depends on whether the loop executes: if the loop does not execute, `ratings` remains an empty list; if the loop executes, the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will never be met, and `ratings` remains an empty list.***
