State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(n):` will execute `n` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute even once.
3. The variables `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` being empty lists do not affect whether the loop can execute. These lists will be modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the key state adjustments needed are ensuring `n` is greater than 0, while keeping `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` as empty lists since these conditions do not impact the loop's execution.
