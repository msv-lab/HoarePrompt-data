You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to check if a participant's rating has changed and if the new standings do not violate the rules for a rated round.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Checking if Ratings Changed**: The program checks if at least one participant's rating has changed using the following block:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
           rated = True
           break
   ```
   This block is correct.

2. **Checking Standings Order**: The program checks if the new standings violate the rule for a rated round using the following block:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       for j in range(i + 1, n):
           if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
               unrated = False
               break
   ```
   However, this block does not correctly handle all cases. It only checks if a lower-rated participant ends up with a better position than a higher-rated participant. It does not check if a higher-rated participant ends up with a worse position than a lower-rated participant.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
4
3000 2999
2999 3000
2998 2997
2997 2998
```
- Before the round, the ratings are: `[3000, 2999, 2998, 2997]`.
- After the round, the ratings are: `[2999, 3000, 2997, 2998]`.

In this case:
- Participant 1 (3000 -> 2999) and Participant 2 (2999 -> 3000) swap positions.
- Participant 3 (2998 -> 2997) and Participant 4 (2997 -> 2998) swap positions.
- No one's rating has changed, so `rated` is set to `False`.
- The standings check also fails because it only checks if a lower-rated participant ends up with a better position, which is not violated here.

However, the correct conclusion should be that the round is rated because the standings have changed in such a way that a higher-rated participant ends up with a worse position than a lower-rated participant, which violates the rule for an unrated round.

Therefore, the program incorrectly classifies this scenario as "maybe" instead of "rated", indicating that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) lines, where each line contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126). The values represent the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings_before.append(a)
        
        ratings_after.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `ratings_before` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `ratings_after` is a list of length `n+1` containing integers where `ratings_after[i]` (for `0 <= i < n`) is equal to `ratings_before[i]` and `ratings_after[n]` is the last `ratings_after` value entered.
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i
                ] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        
        if not unrated:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `unrated` is `False` if there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`.
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `unrated` is `False` if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`.
    if rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`unrated` is a boolean value. If there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i] >= ratings_after[i]`, then `unrated` remains `False`. Otherwise, `unrated` remains `True`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`unrated` is a boolean value. If there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]`, then `unrated` is `False`. Otherwise, `unrated` remains `True`. Additionally, if the condition `(rated)` is true, the string 'rated' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of participants' ratings before and after a round, stored in two lists. It then checks whether there are any participants whose ratings have decreased and prints 'rated' if at least one participant's rating has increased. If no participant's rating has increased, it prints 'unrated' if all ratings are the same or have decreased, and 'maybe' otherwise. The function does not return anything but prints one of the three possible outcomes: 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe'. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all ratings remain the same or decrease, or where at least one rating increases. The function also includes nested loops to check for specific conditions related to the ratings before and after the round.
