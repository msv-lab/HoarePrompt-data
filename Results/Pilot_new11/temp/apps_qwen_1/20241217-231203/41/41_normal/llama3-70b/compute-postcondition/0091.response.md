Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False` if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i] >= ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`. Since the condition `(unrated)` is true, the current state of `unrated` remains `False` if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i] >= ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `unrated` remains `True`.***
