Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `unrated` remains unchanged (False). The ratings before and after at index `i` satisfy the condition: `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, where `j` is an index different from `i`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or block.**
