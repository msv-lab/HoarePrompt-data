The code assigns `True` to the variable `maybe`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `maybe`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ratings_before` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `ratings_after` is a list of length `n+1` containing integers where `ratings_after[i]` (for `0 <= i < n`) is equal to `ratings_before[i]` and `ratings_after[n]` is the last `ratings_after` value entered, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`**
