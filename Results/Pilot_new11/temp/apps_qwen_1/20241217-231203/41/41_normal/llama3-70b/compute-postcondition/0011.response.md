According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0. 

Since the loop runs for `n` iterations and we need to determine the state before the next iteration starts, `n` should be decremented by 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

However, the problem does not provide information about the specific value of `n` but only its condition. Thus, the state adjustment should reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing `[a, b]`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `[b, a, b]`**
