The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, and `rated`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ratings_before` is a list of length `n` containing integers, `ratings_after` is a list of length `n+1` containing integers where `ratings_after[i]` (for `0 <= i < n`) is equal to `ratings_before[i]` and `ratings_after[n]` is the last `ratings_after` value entered, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`**
