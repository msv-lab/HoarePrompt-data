The input consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) lines, where each line contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126). The values represent the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
