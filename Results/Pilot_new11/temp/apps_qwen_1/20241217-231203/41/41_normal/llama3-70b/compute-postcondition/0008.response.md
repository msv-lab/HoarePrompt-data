The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
