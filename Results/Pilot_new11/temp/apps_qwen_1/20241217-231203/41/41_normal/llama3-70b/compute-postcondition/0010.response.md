The code appends the value of `b` to the `ratings_after` list. Since `ratings_after` was initially a list containing `[b, a]`, after appending `b`, it becomes `[b, a, b]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing `[a, b]`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `[b, a, b]`**
