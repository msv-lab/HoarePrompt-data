The code `unrated = False` does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `j`. It only changes the value of `unrated` to `False`. The initial state of `unrated` being `False` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer greater than `i`, `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 2`**
