The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state of `n` being greater than 1 and the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are not directly affected by this code, but `ratings_after` will be updated since it contains `b` which will now be one of the input values.

The `map(int, input().split())` function will convert the input strings into integers. Let's denote the inputs as `x` and `y`. So, `a` will be assigned `x` and `b` will be assigned `y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing `[x, y]`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `[y, x, y]`**
