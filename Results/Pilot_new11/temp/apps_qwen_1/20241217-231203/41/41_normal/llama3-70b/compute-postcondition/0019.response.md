Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n > 0` because `range(n)` generates values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Identify the Variables that Need to be Adjusted**:
   - The primary variable to check is `n`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. So, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

4. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ratings_before` is a list of length `n`.
   - `ratings_after` is a list of length `n+1` where `ratings_after[i]` (for `0 <= i < n`) is equal to `ratings_before[i]` and `ratings_after[n]` is the last `ratings_after` value entered.
   - `rated` is `False`.
   - `unrated` is `True`.
   - `maybe` is `True`.

5. **Determine the Required States**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n > 0`.
   - The loop variable `i` should start at 0.

Given this analysis, the required states for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
