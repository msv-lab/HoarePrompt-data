The code reads three integers from the input, which are assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, and `M`. These values replace the existing values of `n`, `k`, and `M` respectively. Since the input is read from the user, the specific values of these variables are not known until runtime, but we know they satisfy the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an input integer within the range 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9**
