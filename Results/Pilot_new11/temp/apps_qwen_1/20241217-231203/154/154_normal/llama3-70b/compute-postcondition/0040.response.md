Let's analyze the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `M + 1`.
   - `dp[i][j]` is calculated as `max(dp[i][M], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`, under the condition `j >= t[i - 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `M + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `M + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to the next value within the range `1` to `M + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently `M + 1`, the next value `j` would be `1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` will be reset to `1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The `dp` table values will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `j` is set to `1`.
- The condition `j >= t[i - 1]` must still hold true.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is `1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][M], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`, considering the condition `j >= t[i - 1]` is satisfied.**
