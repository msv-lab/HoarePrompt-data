Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where each element is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]` for all valid `j` in the range `1 ≤ j ≤ M`, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`**
