Output State: **`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (k+1) × (M+1) where `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`, for all pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i ≤ k+1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ M+1.**
