Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 46.
   - `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
   - `M` is a non-negative integer.
   - `t` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\).

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range specified by the `range` function, i.e., \(1 \leq i < k + 1\).

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 46.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `k + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 46, the condition `1 <= i < k + 1` implies that `k + 1` must be greater than 46, but since `k` is defined as being in the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), this condition cannot be satisfied.

Given the constraints, the loop cannot execute one more time because `i` is already 46 and `k` is at most 45, making the loop condition `1 <= i < k + 1` false.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

**State: **No adjustment needed as the loop has completed its iterations.**
