The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `M` (where `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (each integer in `t` is such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000). The function first reads these inputs and sorts the list `t`. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`. After the dynamic programming process, the function calculates the total number of non-overlapping intervals across all segments of length `M` and counts how many of those intervals have the same index as their value in `dp`. Finally, the function prints the sum of these two values.
