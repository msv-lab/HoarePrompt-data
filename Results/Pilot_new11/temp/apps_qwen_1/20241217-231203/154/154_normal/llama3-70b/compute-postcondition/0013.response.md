Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where `dp[1][j]` is 2 if `j >= t[0]` and 1 otherwise, for `1 ≤ j ≤ M`, and all other elements of `dp` are 0, `j` is 2, `dp[1][2]` is 2 if `2 >= t[0]` and 1 otherwise**
