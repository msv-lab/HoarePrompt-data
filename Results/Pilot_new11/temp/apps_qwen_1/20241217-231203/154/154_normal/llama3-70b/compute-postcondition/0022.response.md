Postcondition: **`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\), and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.**
