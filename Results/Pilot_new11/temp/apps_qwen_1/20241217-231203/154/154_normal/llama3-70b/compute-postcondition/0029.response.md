Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`.
   - The condition for updating `dp[46][j]` depends on whether `j` is greater than or equal to `t[45]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 46.
   - `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
   - `M` is at least 1.
   - `t` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\).
   - If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[45]`, `dp[46][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[45][j - t[45]] + 1`. Otherwise, the state of `dp[46][j]` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M`, the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration must be one less than the current iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop just finished an iteration where `j` was \(j_{prev}\), then for the next iteration, `j` will be \(j_{next} = j_{prev} + 1\).

4. **Check the Condition for the Update:**
   - For the next iteration, we need to check if \(j_{next} \geq t[45]\).
   - If \(j_{next} < t[45]\), the state of `dp[46][j_{next}]` remains unchanged.
   - If \(j_{next} \geq t[45]\), then `dp[46][j_{next}]` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[45][j_{next} - t[45]] + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` remains 46, it does not change.
   - `k` remains within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
   - `M` remains at least 1.
   - `t` remains a sorted list of integers.
   - `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\).

Given that `j` at the end of the previous iteration was \(j_{prev}\), the next value of `j` (which is `j_{next}`) will be \(j_{next} = j_{prev} + 1\).

Since the exact value of `j_{prev}` is not specified, we consider the general case where `j` just incremented from \(j_{prev}\) to \(j_{next}\).

- If \(j_{next} \geq t[45]\), then `dp[46][j_{next}]` will be updated as described.
- If \(j_{next} < t[45]\), `dp[46][j_{next}]` remains unchanged.

However, for the purpose of stating the general next state, we assume the most general case without specific values of `j`:

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\), and `j` is \(j_{next} = j_{prev} + 1\) where \(j_{next} \geq t[45]\) leads to `dp[46][j_{next}]` being updated, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
