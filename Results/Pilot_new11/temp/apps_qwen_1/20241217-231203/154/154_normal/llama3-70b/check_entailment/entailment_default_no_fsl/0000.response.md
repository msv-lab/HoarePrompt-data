Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not account for the correct scoring system as described. 

The problem statement specifies that Polycarp earns points for each subtask solved and an additional point for completing a task if all subtasks are solved. However, the code attempts to maximize the number of non-overlapping intervals of lengths `t[j]` within a segment of length `M`, which is not aligned with the problem's scoring mechanism.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

This is because Polycarp can complete the first task (1+2+3+4=10 minutes, 4 points) and solve one more subtask from the second task (1 minute, 1 point), totaling 6 points.

However, the provided code does not correctly achieve this. Instead, it calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of subtask times within the given time limit, which does not account for the bonus points for completing tasks. This leads to incorrect results for various test cases.

For instance, the code would incorrectly calculate the result for the second example as well, which requires a different approach to ensure the scoring rules are followed correctly.
