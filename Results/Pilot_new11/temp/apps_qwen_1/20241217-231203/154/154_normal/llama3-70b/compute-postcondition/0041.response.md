The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means the value of `dp[i][j]` changes from `max(dp[i][M], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` (under the condition `j >= t[i - 1]`) to `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Since `j` is initially `1`, and assuming there's no prior value for `dp[i][0]` that would affect this calculation, the updated value for `dp[i][1]` will be the same as `dp[i][0]`, which is undefined in the given initial state but is now explicitly set by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.

Output State: **`j` is `1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`**
