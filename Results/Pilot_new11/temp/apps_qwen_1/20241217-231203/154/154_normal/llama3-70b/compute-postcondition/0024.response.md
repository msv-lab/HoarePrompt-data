Postcondition: ***`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\). If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
