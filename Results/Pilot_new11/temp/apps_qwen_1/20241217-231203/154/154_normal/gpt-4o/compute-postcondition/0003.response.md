The code initializes `time_used` by multiplying `complete_tasks` with `total_time_per_task`. However, `complete_tasks` is not defined in the given initial state, and therefore cannot be determined. Since `total_time_per_task` is defined as the sum of all elements in the list `t`, the value of `time_used` will be dependent on the value of `complete_tasks`.

Given the initial state:
- `max_points` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\)
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\)
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`

After executing the line `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, the value of `time_used` depends on the value of `complete_tasks`, which is unknown. The values of `max_points`, `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**.
