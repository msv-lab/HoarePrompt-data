Output State: **`max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point), `remaining_time` is 0, and `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop**.
