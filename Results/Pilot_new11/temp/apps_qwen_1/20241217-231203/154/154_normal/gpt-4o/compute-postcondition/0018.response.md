`subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)\), `remaining_time` remains as it is, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
