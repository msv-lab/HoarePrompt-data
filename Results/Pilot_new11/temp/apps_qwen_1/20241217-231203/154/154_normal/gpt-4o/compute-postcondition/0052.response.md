Output State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved, `remaining_time` is either 0 or less than the smallest element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `max_points` is initialized based on the formula.
  - `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, and `subtasks_solved` are defined.
  - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains unchanged.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates over each element in the list `t`.
  - For each iteration, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to the current `subtask_time` (`subtask_time = t[j]`), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
  - `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.
  - `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop completes, `subtasks_solved` will be the total number of subtasks solved across all tasks.
  - `remaining_time` will either be 0 (if enough time was available to solve all subtasks) or less than the smallest element in `t` (if there wasn't enough time left to solve any more subtasks).
  - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains unchanged because it is only updated within the loop and does not get modified outside of it.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations is as described above.
