The code `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates the value of `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `remaining_time` is 0
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\)
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the maximum subtasks solved in any iteration
- `max_points` is the maximum of its original value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`

The code does not affect `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `time_used`, or `subtasks_solved`. It only updates `max_points`.

Let's denote the new value of `max_points` as \( \text{new\_max\_points} \). The new value of `max_points` is the maximum of its current value (`max_points`) and the value of `points + subtasks_solved`. So, we can write:

\[ \text{new\_max\_points} = \max(\text{max_points}, \text{points} + \text{subtasks\_solved}) \]

Thus, the updated value of `max_points` is the maximum of its original value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the maximum subtasks solved in any iteration, `max_points` is the maximum of its original value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
