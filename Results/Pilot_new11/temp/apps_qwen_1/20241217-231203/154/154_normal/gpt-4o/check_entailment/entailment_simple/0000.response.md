Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into components. The values are assigned to variables `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. The constraints on these variables are respected (e.g., `1 ≤ n ≤ 45`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 45`, `0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9`, and `1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000`).

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The program uses a dynamic approach to find the maximum points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`.
   - The `func_1` function iterates over the number of tasks `complete_tasks` that Polycarp can fully complete, up to `n`. For each `complete_tasks`, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and checks if it exceeds `M`.
   - If `time_used` does not exceed `M`, it calculates the points earned from completing `complete_tasks` full tasks (`points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`).
   - Then, it iterates over each subtask time in `t` to see how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time (`remaining_time`). The number of subtasks solved is added to `subtasks_solved`.
   - The variable `subtasks_solved` is capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k` to ensure that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the total number of subtasks available in the remaining tasks.
   - Finally, it updates `max_points` to be the maximum between its current value and the new points calculated (`points + subtasks_solved`).

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns `max_points`, which represents the maximum points Polycarp can earn.

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including the constraints and the logic for calculating the maximum points. It accounts for both completing full tasks and solving additional subtasks within the time limit, ensuring that the solution adheres to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the requirements specified in the problem description.
