`points` is assigned the value `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Given the initial state, `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is equal to `time_used`, and `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `k + 1` is also a positive integer. The value of `points` is now `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, and `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 1, `remaining_time` must be non-zero (greater than or equal to the smallest element in `t`), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is the maximum of its current value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.**
