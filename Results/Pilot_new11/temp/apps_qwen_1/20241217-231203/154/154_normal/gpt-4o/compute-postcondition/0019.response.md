The code subtracts `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. From the initial state, we know that `remaining_time > M` and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `remaining_time` is an integer, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`.

Therefore, the updated value of `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.

Let's denote the initial value of `remaining_time` as `R`. After executing the line of code, `remaining_time` becomes `R - (R // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ remaining_time = R - \left(\frac{R}{subtask_time}\right) \times subtask_time \]

Since \(\frac{R}{subtask_time} \times subtask_time\) is simply \(R\) when \(R\) is divisible by `subtask_time`, and otherwise, it is the largest multiple of `subtask_time` less than or equal to `R`, we can write the updated value of `remaining_time` as:

\[ remaining_time = R - (R // subtask_time) \times subtask_time \]

Given the initial conditions, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)\), `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`**
