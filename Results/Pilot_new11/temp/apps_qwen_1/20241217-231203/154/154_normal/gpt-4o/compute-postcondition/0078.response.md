Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the maximum subtasks solved in any iteration, `max_points` is the maximum of its original value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**.

### Explanation:
- **`remaining_time`**: This variable decreases by `subtask_time` in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop continues only if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`, once `remaining_time` becomes 0, no further iterations occur.
  
- **`subtasks_solved`**: This variable increases by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` in each iteration. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` eventually becomes 0, `subtasks_solved` will accumulate the total number of subtasks solved.

- **`max_subtasks_for_this_task`**: This variable represents the maximum number of subtasks that could be completed in any single iteration. It is updated in each iteration based on the current `remaining_time` and `subtask_time`.

- **`max_points`**: This variable is updated in the initial state to be the maximum of its original value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Since the loop itself does not change this value, it remains unchanged.

- **`time_used`**: This variable is initialized to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same after the loop completes.
