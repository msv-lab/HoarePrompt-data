To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `max_points` is defined as `max(0, (i + 1) * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - (i + 1)) * k))`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
- `time_used` is now equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`.
- `subtasks_solved` is 0.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged.

### For Loop:
```
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over each element in the list `t`, which means `subtask_time` takes on each value in the list `t` one by one.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. **List `t` should have at least one element**: Since the loop iterates over `t`, if `t` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, `t` must have at least one element.
2. **Initialization of `subtasks_solved`**: The variable `subtasks_solved` is given as 0. This does not affect the loop directly but might influence the calculation of `max_points`.

### Summary of Adjustments Needed:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `t` has at least one element.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`t` must have at least one element**.

This adjustment ensures that the loop can iterate over at least one element in the list `t`.
