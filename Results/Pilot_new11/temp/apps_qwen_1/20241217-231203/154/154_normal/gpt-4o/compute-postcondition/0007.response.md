The code assigns `points` to the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. However, the variable `complete_tasks` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, the value of `points` cannot be determined precisely, but it is expressed in terms of `complete_tasks`, `k`, and their multiplication.

The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state: `max_points` is still 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`.

Output State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`**
