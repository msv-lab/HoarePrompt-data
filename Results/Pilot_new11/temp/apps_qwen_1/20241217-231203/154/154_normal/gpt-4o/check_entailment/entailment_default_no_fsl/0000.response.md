Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not consider the scenario where completing a task and earning the extra point is more beneficial than just solving individual subtasks within the remaining time.

Let's consider an example:

### Example:
- Input:
  ```
  2 2 5
  2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```
  Because:
  - Polycarp can complete the first task in 2 + 3 = 5 minutes and get 2 + 1 = 3 points.
  - With no remaining time, he cannot solve any subtasks from the second task.
  - Therefore, the maximum points he can earn is 3 (from the first task).

However, the current implementation only considers the points from completing tasks and solving subtasks within the remaining time. It does not check if completing a task and getting the extra point is more beneficial than solving individual subtasks. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the code checks both options (completing tasks and solving subtasks) and selects the one that gives the maximum points. Here is a modified version of the function that includes this logic:

```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        # Calculate the points if Polycarp completes the next task
        if complete_tasks < n:
            points_if_complete_next_task = points + (k + 1)
            time_for_next_task = total_time_per_task
            if time_for_next_task <= remaining_time:
                max_points = max(max_points, points_if_complete_next_task)
        
        # Calculate the points if Polycarp solves subtasks in the remaining time
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
            else:
                break
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        points_if_solve_subtasks = points + subtasks_solved
        max_points = max(max_points, points_if_solve_subtasks)
    
    return max_points
```

With this modification, the code correctly handles the scenario where completing a task and earning the extra point is more beneficial than solving individual subtasks within the remaining time.
