The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of tasks), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of subtasks per task), `M` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum available time), and `t` (a list of `k` positive integers representing the time required for each subtask). The function calculates the maximum possible points that can be earned by completing a certain number of tasks within the given time constraint. Points are earned based on the number of tasks completed and the number of subtasks solved within the remaining time. The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of the sum of points and subtasks solved achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
