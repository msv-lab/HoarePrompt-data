The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, in this case, no loop is present, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The states of the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`**
