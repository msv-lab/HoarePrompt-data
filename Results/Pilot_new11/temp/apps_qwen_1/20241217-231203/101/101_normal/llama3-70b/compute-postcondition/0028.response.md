Postcondition: ***`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and for all positions `(i, j)` within the bounds of the frame:
- If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then the pixel at position `(i, j)` is set to `'+'`.
- Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the pixel remains unchanged; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.***
