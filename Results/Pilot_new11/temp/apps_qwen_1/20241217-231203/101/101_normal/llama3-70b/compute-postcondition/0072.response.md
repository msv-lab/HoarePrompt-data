The `continue` statement in the code does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `j`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `pixels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'.**
