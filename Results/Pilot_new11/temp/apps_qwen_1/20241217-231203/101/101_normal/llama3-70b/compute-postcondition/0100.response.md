Functionality: **The function reads a grid of pixels from standard input, where each line contains exactly `m` characters representing either a period (black pixel) or the letter 'w' (white pixel). It calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the bounding box can fit within the original grid dimensions. If the bounding box exceeds the grid dimensions, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it pads the grid with '+' characters along the edges defined by the bounding box and prints the modified grid. The function handles cases where the grid might be too small to contain the bounding box by printing `-1`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the grid dimensions (`n` and `m`) are less than 2, the function should handle these cases appropriately, possibly by raising an error or returning a specific value.
- The function assumes at least one 'w' is present, but it should explicitly check for this condition to avoid errors.
- The function should ensure that the bounding box coordinates are within valid indices of the grid (e.g., `min_x >= 0` and `min_y >= 0`).
