Let's analyze the given scenario step by step.

### Given Scenario:
State at the end of the previous iteration:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
2. **Determine the State After Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop has just completed an iteration.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop has just finished, `i` is currently `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Since the loop just finished its last iteration with `i` being `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n` (which is the start of the next iteration).
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the loop condition does not modify `n`.

### Updated State:
State: **`i` is n, `n` must be the same as before**.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `total` or any other variables mentioned in the previous examples, we will assume no changes to those variables unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is n, `n` must be the same as before**.
