Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is the same as before, `pixels[i][j]` for all `i` and `j` is either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '` where: 
- If `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.
- If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, then `pixels[i][j]` remains `'w'`.
- Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains `'.'`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each row `i` from `0` to `n-1` and each column `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
- During each iteration, if the current pixel `(i, j)` meets any of the conditions (`i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`) and its value is `'.'`, it is set to `'+'`.
- If the current pixel is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
- If none of the conditions are met, the pixel remains `'.'`.

After all iterations, since the loop will terminate after processing all rows and columns, `i` will reach `n`, and `j` will cycle through all possible columns `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, the final state of `pixels` will be modified according to the described rules, with no further changes to `i`, `j`, `n`, or `m`.
