The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not show which loop this statement belongs to, so the actual impact on the variables is not specified. Since no changes are made to the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or the pixel value `pixels[i][j]`, these variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' or 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
