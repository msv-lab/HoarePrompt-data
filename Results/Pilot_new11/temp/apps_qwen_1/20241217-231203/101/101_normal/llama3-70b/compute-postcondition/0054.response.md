The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and column `j`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, the code modifies the `pixels` list but does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, or `j`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.**
