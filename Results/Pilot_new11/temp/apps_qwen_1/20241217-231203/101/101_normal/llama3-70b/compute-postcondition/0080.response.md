The code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` from either '+' or 'w' to '.'. The variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the change in the pixel value.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is now '.'.**
