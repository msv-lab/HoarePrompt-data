Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`, `j` remains unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the condition is met as is. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `j` remains unchanged and the condition remains unchanged.**
