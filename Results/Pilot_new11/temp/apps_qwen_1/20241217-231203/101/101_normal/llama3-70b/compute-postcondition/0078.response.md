The code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'`. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same as in the initial state, and the value of `m` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `m` is greater than or equal to 1.**
