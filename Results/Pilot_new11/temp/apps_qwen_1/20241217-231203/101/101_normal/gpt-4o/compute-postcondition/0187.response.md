Let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- `result` is a 2D list where the elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`.
- `i` is `bottom + 1`.
- The loop sets `result[i][j]` to `'+'.` if `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is `'.'`. No changes occur otherwise.

### State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `bottom + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` from `top` to `bottom + 1`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bottom + 1`.
- For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be within the range `top` to `bottom + 1`.
- Since `i` is `bottom + 1`, it means `i` is already out of the range specified by the loop condition (`top` to `bottom + 1`).

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is already `bottom + 1`, the loop cannot execute another iteration because the condition `top <= i <= bottom + 1` will not be satisfied.

### Adjusted State:
- `result` remains unchanged because the loop does not execute another iteration.
- `i` remains `bottom + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is a 2D list where the elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`**.
