Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are both `m-1`. If `i` is less than `top`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as well since there is no else part provided.***
