The code sets `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, so both `top` and `bottom` are now `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
