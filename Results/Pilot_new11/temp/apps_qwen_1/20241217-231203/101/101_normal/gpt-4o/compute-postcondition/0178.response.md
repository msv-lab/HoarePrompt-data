To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `left` to `right + 1`.
- The initial states at the end of the previous iteration are:
  - `i` is an integer
  - `j` is an integer
  - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers
- If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to `'+'`.
- Otherwise, if `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, no change is made to the program state.

### Loop Structure:
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right + 1)`.
2. **Previous Iteration End State**:
   - `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `j` is incremented at the end of each iteration.
   - `j` is in the range `[left, right + 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States:
- **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value within the range `[left, right + 1)`.
- **Next Iteration Start State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range.

Let's assume `j` was at its maximum value before the loop ended (i.e., `j == right`). In this case, incrementing `j` would make it `right + 1`, which is out of the range, and the loop would terminate.

If `j` was less than `right`, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- If `j` was less than `right` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `j + 1`.
- If `j` was equal to `right` at the end of the previous iteration, then the loop will not execute again.

Given the general nature of the problem without specific values, we can assume the most common scenario where `j` is within the range and can be incremented.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer (j+1), and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers.**

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, and all other states remain unchanged.
