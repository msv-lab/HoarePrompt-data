Postcondition: ***`result[i][left + 2]` is set to `+` if `i == bottom + 1` and either `i == top`, `i == bottom`, `j == left`, or `(j == right)`. The condition `left < right` is maintained. If `result[i][left + 2]` was `.` before, it is now set to `+`. No other changes occur if there is no corresponding else part.***
