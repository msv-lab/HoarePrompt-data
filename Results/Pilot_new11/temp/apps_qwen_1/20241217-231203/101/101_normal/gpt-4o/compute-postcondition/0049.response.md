To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
- `i` is `n-1` (initially pointing to the last row).
- `j` is `m-1` (initially pointing to the last column).
- `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the rows of the 2D list `screen` using `i` as the index. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- This means the loop has already checked the last row of the 2D list.

### Loop Execution:
Since `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will check if `i < n` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. However, since `i` is currently `n-1`, it will not satisfy the condition `i < n`.

### Adjustment Needed:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `i` such that it becomes less than `n`. But in the current state, `i` cannot be adjusted because it is set to `n-1` and the loop condition cannot be satisfied anymore with this value.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is already at its maximum possible value (`n-1`), the loop will not execute any further. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the existing states for the loop to execute one more time, as it won't.

### Final Answer:
State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.**

No changes are necessary because the loop will not execute again due to the condition `i < n` not being satisfied.
