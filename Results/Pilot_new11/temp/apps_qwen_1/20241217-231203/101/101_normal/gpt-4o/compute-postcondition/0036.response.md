`top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`. The values of `j`, `screen`, `i`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 2`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `right` retains its value from the previous iteration.
