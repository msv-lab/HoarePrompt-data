The code snippet `right = j` assigns the current value of `j` to the variable `right`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `screen` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged unless it was originally greater than `bottom` and `j > right`, which is not the case here since `right` is now updated to `j`.
- `j` is unchanged.
- `top` remains unchanged.
- `bottom` remains unchanged.
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `right` is now assigned the value of `j`.

Since `right` is updated to `j`, the only change is in the value of `right`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is set to `n-1`, `left` and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `right` is now `j`. The final value of `i` is either `n-1` (if it was originally greater than `bottom`) or retains its original value (if it was originally less than or equal to `bottom`). If `j > right`, `i` remains unchanged; otherwise, no change is applied to `i`.**
