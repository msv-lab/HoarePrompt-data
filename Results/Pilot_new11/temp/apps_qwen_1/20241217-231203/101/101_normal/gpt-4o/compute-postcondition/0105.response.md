The code sets `top` to the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is `n-1`. Since `i` is less than `top` initially, and `i` is now assigned to `top`, `top` is also `n-1`. The values of `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged because they were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is None or the minimum and maximum row index of 'w' pixels, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' pixels, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' pixels, and `m` must be greater than 0.**
