The code sets `top` to `i` and `bottom` to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, so both `top` and `bottom` are now `n-1`. The value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', which remains unchanged. The values of `left`, `right`, `m`, and `j` (which is `m-1`) remain the same. Therefore, the output state updates `top` and `bottom` to `n-1`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
