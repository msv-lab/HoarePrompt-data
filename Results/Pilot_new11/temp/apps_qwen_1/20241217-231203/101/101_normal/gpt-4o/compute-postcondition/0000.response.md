The code initializes four variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to `None`. These variables do not have any previous values and are simply set to `None` now. The precondition that the screen is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters, and that the characters are either `'.'` or `'w'`, and at least one `'w'` exists in the screen, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and screen is a list of n strings, each string contains exactly m characters, and the characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the screen.**
