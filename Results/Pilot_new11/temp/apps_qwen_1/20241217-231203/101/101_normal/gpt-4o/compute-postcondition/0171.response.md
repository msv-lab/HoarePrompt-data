To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `result` is a 2D list where the elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`.
  - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the boundary indices used to mark the elements in the 2D list.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `top` to `bottom + 1`.
- This means that for each value of `i` within this range, the loop body is executed.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the last value in this range, which is `bottom`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently `bottom` (since it is the last value in the range).
   - The loop needs to continue if `i` is less than `bottom + 1`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next value, which is `bottom + 1`.
   - However, since the loop is defined as `range(top, bottom + 1)`, once `i` reaches `bottom + 1`, the loop will stop because `bottom + 1` is not included in the range.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which needs to be incremented to `bottom + 1` for the loop to continue.
- The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they define the boundaries for marking the elements in the 2D list.

### Final State:
- `i` must be `bottom + 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`result` is a 2D list where the elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`, while all other elements remain unchanged, and `i` is `bottom + 1`**.
