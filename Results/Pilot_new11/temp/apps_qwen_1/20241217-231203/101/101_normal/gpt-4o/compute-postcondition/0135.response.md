Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `top` retains its original value (which is `n-1`), `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`. If `i < top`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
