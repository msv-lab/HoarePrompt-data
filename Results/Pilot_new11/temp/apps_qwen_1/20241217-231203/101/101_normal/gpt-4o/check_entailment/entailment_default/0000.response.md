Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the entire screen is filled with black pixels ('.'), which means there are no white pixels to form a frame. In such a scenario, the function should return -1, but the current implementation will incorrectly proceed to calculate the bounding box and attempt to mark the boundary pixels, leading to an incorrect output. The code should include a check for this edge case to ensure it returns -1 when no white pixels are present.
