According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1` inclusive. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the value of `j` is set to `left` initially and is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right + 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- `j` is equal to `left`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment to the next value within the range. Therefore, `j` must become `left + 1`.

Since `j` is `left` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented to `left + 1`. However, the condition `left <= right` must still hold true.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is left + 1**
