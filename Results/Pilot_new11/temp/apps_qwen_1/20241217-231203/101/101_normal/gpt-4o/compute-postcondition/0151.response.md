Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`. The height of the frame (`frame_height`) is less than 2 or the width of the frame (`frame_width`) is less than 2.***
