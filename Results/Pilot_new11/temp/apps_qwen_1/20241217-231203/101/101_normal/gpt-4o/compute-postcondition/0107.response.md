Postcondition: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. If `i < top`, then `i` remains `n-1` and `top` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `top` retains its original value. The current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.
