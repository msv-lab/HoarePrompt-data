Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`. The value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `top` is `None`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `i` and `j`. If `j > right`, then `right` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.***
