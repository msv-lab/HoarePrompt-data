Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i` and `bottom` is set to `i`, and both `left` and `right` are set to `j + 2`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `j` is less than `left`, then `j` is set to `left` and `right` equals `left`; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged and `right` equals `j`. The values of `i`, `left`, and `right` retain their previous values unless updated within the if-else block.***
