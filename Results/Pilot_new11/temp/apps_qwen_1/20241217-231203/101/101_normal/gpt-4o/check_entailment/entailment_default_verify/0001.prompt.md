You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)

                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the smallest possible frame might not be returned. Let's examine a case where the program might fail:

Consider the input:
```
4 6
w.....
w.....
w.....
w.....
```

In this case, the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions would be a frame of size 1x1, centered around any of the white pixels. However, the program currently checks if `frame_height` and `frame_width` are both greater than or equal to 2 before constructing the frame. This condition will prevent the program from returning a 1x1 frame.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check for the smallest possible frame after determining the bounds of the white pixels. Here is an updated version of the function that handles this case correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        # Explicitly handle the case where the smallest frame is 1x1
        result = [list(row) for row in screen]
        for i in range(max(0, top - 1), min(n, top + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, left - 1), min(m, right + 2)):
                if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                    if result[i][j] == '.':
                        result[i][j] = '+'
        return result
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle cases where the smallest possible frame is 1x1.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the `screen`.

The function first identifies the bounding box of the white pixels ('w') in the `screen` by finding the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of 'w'. If no 'w' is found, it returns -1. If the bounding box has a height or width less than 2, it also returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the `screen` and marks all the boundary elements of the bounding box with '+'.

Thus, the final state of the program after executing `func_1` is one of the following:
- The program returns -1 if no 'w' is found or if the bounding box has a height or width less than 2.
- The program returns a 2D list `result` where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with '+'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the program returns -1 in multiple cases, but the actual code only includes one return statement within the `if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None)` block. This implies that if the bounding box dimensions are less than 2, the function should also return -1, which is already covered in the second condition check.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the entire `screen` is filled with '.'. In this case, the function would still find the bounding box but would return -1 because the width or height would be less than 2.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
