Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then:
- If `top` is `None`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `i` and `j`.
- If `j > right`, `right` is set to `j`.
- Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.**
