`top` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is less than `top`, so after the assignment, `top` will be equal to `i`, and the value of `i` remains the same. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `i`, and the current value of `i` is less than `top`.**
