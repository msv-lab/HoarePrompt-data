Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 1`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is `j` if `j < left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged, and `right` is `j` if `j > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.***
