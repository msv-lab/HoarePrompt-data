Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-2`.
   - If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `right` is `m-2`.
   - Otherwise, the variables `i`, `j`, `right`, and `top` retain their original values from the precondition, with `right` being `m-2` if `top` is `None` and `right` remains unchanged otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - **j Variable**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `m-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `m-1`.
   - **right Variable**: The value of `right` depends on the condition of `screen[i][j]`:
     - If `screen[i][j]` was `'w'` at the end of the previous iteration, `right` is already `m-2`.
     - If `screen[i][j]` was not `'w'`, then `right` retains its original value from the precondition. However, since the loop is about to start again, we need to consider the new value of `j` (which is `m-1`).

4. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `screen` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains `n-1`.
   - `j` becomes `m-1`.
   - If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `right` is `m-2`.
   - If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `right` retains its original value from the precondition, with `right` being `m-2` if `top` is `None` and `right` remains unchanged otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, if `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `right` is `m-2`, otherwise `right` retains its original value from the precondition, with `right` being `m-2` if `top` is `None` and `right` remains unchanged otherwise.**
