Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that any skewer not already in its correct position or not requiring reversal will need to be changed, which is not necessarily true.

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
1 3 2
0 0 0
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

The program increments `ans` for each skewer not in its correct position and each `b[i]` that is 0. This is incorrect because it overcounts the changes needed. In this example, only one change is needed: reversing the second skewer (at index 1). The first and third skewers do not need to be moved, and the first skewer does not need to be reversed since it is already in its correct position initially.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.
