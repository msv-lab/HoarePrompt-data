The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `p`. Since the initial state specifies that `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, and the code replaces this permutation with a list of integers read from input, the value of `p` changes to whatever integers are entered, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a list of integers read from input, which is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.**
