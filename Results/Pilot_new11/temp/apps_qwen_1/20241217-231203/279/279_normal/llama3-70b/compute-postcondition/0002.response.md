The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. The variable `p` remains unchanged. The initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the input for `b` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `p` is a list of integers read from input, which is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers read from input, which is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.**
