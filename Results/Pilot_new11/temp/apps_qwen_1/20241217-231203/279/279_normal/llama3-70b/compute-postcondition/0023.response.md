The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If any element in `b` is 0, the function returns False.
- Case_2: If all elements in `b` are 1, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `p`, and `b` and return `False` if any element in `b` is 0, otherwise return `True`.
