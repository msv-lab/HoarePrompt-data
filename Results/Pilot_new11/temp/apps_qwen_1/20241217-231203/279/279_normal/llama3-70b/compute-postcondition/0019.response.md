The `ans` variable is incremented by 1. This means that `ans` is now one more than its previous value. The initial state mentions that if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Since this condition is met (as `ans` is incremented), we confirm that `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`.

The output state will reflect the increment of `ans` by 1 and keep the other variables unchanged according to their initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
