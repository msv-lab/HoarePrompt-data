Functionality: **The function reads three lines of input: an integer \( n \), a permutation of integers, and a sequence of zeros and ones. It then identifies all cycles in the permutation and checks each cycle to determine if all elements within the cycle satisfy the condition \( b[x] == 0 \). If there is only one cycle, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of cycles where all elements satisfy \( b[x] == 0 \), unless this count is zero, in which case it prints 1.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where \( n \) is 1, which would result in a single cycle and the function should print 0.
- The function correctly handles the scenario where no cycles have all elements satisfying \( b[x] == 0 \), printing 1 in such cases.
- The function assumes valid input constraints: \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \), the permutation is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), and the sequence \( b \) consists of zeros and ones.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid input (e.g., non-integer values in the input or permutations that are not valid), which could lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are provided.
