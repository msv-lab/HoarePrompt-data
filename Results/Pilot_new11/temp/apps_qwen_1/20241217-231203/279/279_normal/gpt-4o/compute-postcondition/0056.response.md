`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Given that `x` is defined as `p[p[i_new] - 1] - 1`, this means that the element at index `x` in the `visited` list is set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, and the element at index `x` (where `x = p[p[i_new] - 1] - 1`) is now `True`; `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `i_new` is less than `n`; `visited[x]` is `True`**
