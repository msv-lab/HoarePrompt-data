The code `n = int(data[0])` assigns the value of the first element of the list `data` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list containing the split values from the input
- `n` is the first element of `data` as an integer
- `p` is the sublist of `data` starting from the second element to the n+1th element
- `b` is the sublist of `data` starting from the n+2th element to the end

After executing the code:
- `n` is now the integer value of the first element of `data`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `data`
- `p` remains the sublist of `data` starting from the second element to the n+1th element
- `b` remains the sublist of `data` starting from the n+2th element to the end

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first element of `data`, `p` is the sublist of `data` starting from the second element to the n+1th element, `b` is the sublist of `data` starting from the n+2th element to the end**
