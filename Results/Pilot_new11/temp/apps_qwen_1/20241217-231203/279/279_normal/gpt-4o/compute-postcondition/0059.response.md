Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements, `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `i_new` is no longer less than `n` (it is `n`), `x` is the last element added to `cycle`, and `visited[x]` is `True`**
