Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires calculating the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) is equal to \( f_{max}(n) \), where \( f(p) \) is defined as the number of distinct GCD values of the prefix sums of \( p \).

#### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( f_{max}(n) \):**
   - The function `func_2` calculates \( f_{max}(n) \) by computing the GCD of consecutive integers from 1 to \( n \) using `func_1`. However, this approach does not correctly compute \( f_{max}(n) \) as defined in the problem. The GCD of prefix sums of a permutation is not directly related to the GCD of consecutive integers.
   - The correct approach would involve generating all possible permutations and calculating \( f(p) \) for each, keeping track of the maximum \( f(p) \).

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` seems to attempt a dynamic programming approach to count the number of permutations with the desired property. However, the logic inside the nested loops does not accurately reflect the combinatorial counting needed for the problem.
   - The calculation of `dp[j]` as a cumulative sum does not align with the combinatorial counting of permutations that achieve the maximum \( f(p) \).

3. **Lack of Permutation Generation and GCD Calculation:**
   - The program does not generate all permutations of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) and calculate \( f(p) \) for each permutation to find those with \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).
   - Instead, it relies on a precomputed value of \( f_{max}(n) \) and attempts to count permutations, which is not straightforward without the correct combinatorial logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It fails to properly compute \( f_{max}(n) \) and does not accurately count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
