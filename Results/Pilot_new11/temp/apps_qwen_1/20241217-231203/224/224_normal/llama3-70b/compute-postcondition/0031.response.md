The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it, and then the line `dp[j] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[j]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Given that `MOD` is 10, this means `dp[j]` will be the last digit of its current value plus `dp[j - 1]`.

From the initial conditions:
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.

After executing `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, and then the result is taken modulo 10.

So, the output state is:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.
- `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]` and then taken modulo 10.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1] and then taken modulo 10`.**
