The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is decreased by 1 from the previous value, let's consider the impact on `dp[j]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10`.
- `j` is decreased by 1 from the previous value, and `j` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's denote the new value of `dp[j]` after the update as `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`.

Since `j` is being decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, the equation for `dp[j]` now becomes:
- Initially, `dp[1] = dp[0] + 0 % 10 = 1 + 0 = 1`.
- For `dp[2]`, `dp[2] += dp[1]` which means `dp[2] = dp[1] + 1 % 10 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- For `dp[3]`, `dp[3] += dp[2]` which means `dp[3] = dp[2] + 2 % 10 = 2 + 2 = 4`.

Following this pattern, we see that `dp[j]` accumulates the sum of previous `dp[j - 1]` and `(j - 1) % 10`.

Given that `j` starts from `f_max_n - 1` and decreases to 1, the final updated values of `dp[j]` will reflect these additions. However, without a specific `f_max_n`, we cannot give exact numbers, but we know the relationship holds true.

Thus, the output state is:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- `dp[j]` for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is updated to reflect the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and `(j - 1) % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[j]` for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is updated to reflect the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and `(j - 1) % 10`.**
