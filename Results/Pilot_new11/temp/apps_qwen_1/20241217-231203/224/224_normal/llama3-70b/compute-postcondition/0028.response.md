The code snippet updates the `dp[j]` value by taking the modulus with `MOD` (which is 10). This means each `dp[j]` value is updated to its last digit. Since the `dp[j]` values are already calculated to be the last digit of cumulative sums, this operation does not change their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`; `i` is 2; `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements; for each `j`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.**
