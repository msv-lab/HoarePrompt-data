Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10.
- `i` is 2.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1 (inclusive).

#### Key Points:
1. **Range Condition**: The loop will only execute if `f_max_n` is greater than 0. Since `f_max_n` is specified as a positive integer, this condition is always satisfied.
2. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The loop variable `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 1.

Given these points, the critical state to adjust is ensuring that the loop variable `j` can start its iteration from `f_max_n`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (already specified).
- Ensure `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

### Final State Adjustment:
Since `f_max_n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute and `j` will start from `f_max_n` and decrement, we only need to ensure that `f_max_n` meets this requirement.

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10, `i` is 2, and `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements.**

To summarize:
State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10, `i` is 2, and `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements.**
