The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. This operation modifies `dp[j]` for each `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10

For each `j` in the range from `f_max_n` to 1, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.

Let's denote the cumulative sum of integers from 1 to `k` as `sum(k)`. Initially, `dp[j]` is `sum(j) % 10`.

After the update, `dp[j]` becomes `(sum(j) + sum(j - 1)) % 10`.

The initial state for `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` is:
- `dp[1] = (1) % 10 = 1`
- `dp[2] = (1 + 2) % 10 = 3`
- ...
- `dp[f_max_n] = (1 + 2 + ... + f_max_n) % 10`

After the update:
- `dp[1]` remains `1` because `dp[1]` only gets updated if `j > 1`, and when `j = 1`, `dp[0]` does not exist to add to it.
- `dp[2]` changes from `3` to `(3 + 1) % 10 = 4`
- `dp[3]` changes from `(1 + 2 + 3) % 10 = 6` to `(6 + 3) % 10 = 9`
- And so on...

In general, for `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(sum(j) + sum(j - 1)) % 10`.

Since the exact value of `f_max_n` is not specified, we keep it as `f_max_n`.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `(sum(j) + sum(j - 1)) % 10`, where `sum(k)` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `k`.**
