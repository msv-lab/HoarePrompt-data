According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1. The loop variable `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- `dp[j]` is `j % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`

Since the loop decrements `j` by 1, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `f_max_n - 1`.

To determine if the loop can continue executing, we need to ensure that `j` is still within the valid range (i.e., `j > 0`). Given that `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decreases by 1, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `f_max_n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` needs to be updated, but the specific values are not provided or needed to answer the question about the continuation of the loop.
- `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`.

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[j]` is `j % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`**
