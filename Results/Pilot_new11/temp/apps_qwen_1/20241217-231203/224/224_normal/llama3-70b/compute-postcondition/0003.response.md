Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer.
   - Since `n` is defined as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), we need to ensure that `n` is within this range.

3. **Initial Values and States**:
   - `f_max_n` is the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`.
   - `MOD` is set to 10.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros except for `dp[0]`, which is initialized to 1.

4. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute `n` times (since it starts from 1 and goes up to `n` inclusive).

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute correctly.
   - Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the above analysis, the key state adjustments needed are:

- Ensure that `n` is within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- Ensure that `dp` is correctly initialized as a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to zero, except for `dp[0]` which is 1.

Thus, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`n` is within the range 2 to 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros except for `dp[0]` which is 1**.
