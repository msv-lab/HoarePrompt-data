Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The state after the loop ensures that `a` is the GCD of the original inputs, and `b` is set to 0. This function is used correctly in subsequent calculations.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for permutations of length \( n \). The loop iterates from 1 to \( n \) and updates `res` with the GCD of the current value and the next integer, ensuring that the maximum GCD value is computed. The logic here is sound and covers all possible values of \( n \) within the given range.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function calculates the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). It uses dynamic programming to build up the solution, ensuring that the cumulative sum is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The logic is correct and the annotations align well with the implementation.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The code handles the minimum value of \( n \) (which is 2) correctly.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range.
   - The reverse iteration in the inner loop of `func_3` is necessary and correct.

5. **Annotations**: The annotations accurately describe the states and the flow of the program, matching the implementation. There are no discrepancies between the annotations and the code.

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and there are no missing functionalities or logical errors, the code is correct.
