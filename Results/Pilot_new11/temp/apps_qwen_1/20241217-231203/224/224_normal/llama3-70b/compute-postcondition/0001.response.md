The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `f_max_n + 1`. The values of `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros.**
