Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Computation of `f_max_n`:**
   - `func_2` attempts to compute `f_max(n)` using `func_1`, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, `func_1` is meant to compute the GCD of two numbers, but `func_2` applies it iteratively to compute the maximum number of distinct GCD values across all permutations. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the structure of permutations and the GCD properties needed for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:**
   - `func_3` is intended to count the number of permutations achieving the maximum `f(p)` value. However, the state and transitions in the dynamic programming array `dp` are misaligned with the problem requirements. The current implementation of `dp[j]` as the cumulative sum of integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10 does not reflect the combinatorial logic needed to count valid permutations.

3. **Lack of Permutation Generation and Validation:**
   - Neither `func_2` nor `func_3` properly address the core requirement of generating and validating permutations to ensure `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`. The functions are missing the necessary steps to generate permutations and check their `f(p)` values against `f_max(n)`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - While the functions handle edge cases (e.g., `n` being at its minimum value), they do not correctly compute the required results due to the fundamental flaws in their logic.

Based on these points, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program does not meet the problem description requirements due to logical and structural issues in both `func_2` and `func_3`.
