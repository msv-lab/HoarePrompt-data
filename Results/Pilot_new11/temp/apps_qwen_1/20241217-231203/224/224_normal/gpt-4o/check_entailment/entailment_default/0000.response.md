Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality according to the problem description. The function `func_1` computes the factorial of `n-1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the problem requires counting the number of permutations \(p\) of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\).

The maximum value of \(f(p)\) for a permutation of length \(n\) is \(n\), because the GCD of the entire prefix can be at most \(n\) (when the first element is \(n\)). The task is to count the number of such permutations, which is a combinatorial problem that requires a different approach.

The provided code simply returns the factorial of \(n-1\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not related to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
