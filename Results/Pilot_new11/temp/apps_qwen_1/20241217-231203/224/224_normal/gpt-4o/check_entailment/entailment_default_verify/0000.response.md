Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the problem description. The program only handles the special case where \( n = 2 \) and incorrectly calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) for any \( n > 2 \). This approach does not account for the specific requirement of counting permutations where the function \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` calculates the factorial of \( n \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is not relevant to solving the given problem. Therefore, the program remains incorrect based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
