Output State: **`result` is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), `i` is `n + 1` if the loop executed at least once.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`.
- During each iteration, `result` is updated by multiplying it with the current value of `i` and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- After the loop completes, `result` will be the product of all integers from 2 to `n`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is the definition of the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 2 or less), the initial value of `result` remains 1. However, since the problem specifies that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, this scenario is not applicable here. Therefore, we only need to consider the state when the loop has completed its iterations.
