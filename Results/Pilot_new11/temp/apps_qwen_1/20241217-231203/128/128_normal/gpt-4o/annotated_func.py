#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and f are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the i-th day, respectively.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is a list of 0 tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each iteration, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
- `days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). These integers represent the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the \(i\)-th day, respectively.

The function processes the `days` list to calculate two lists: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`. For each day, `regular_sales` stores the minimum of the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients, while `potential_sales_increase` stores the difference between twice the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients, minus the value stored in `regular_sales`.

After calculating these lists, the function computes `total_sales` by summing the values in `regular_sales` and then adding the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`, sorted in reverse order. Finally, the function returns `total_sales`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `f` is 0, no additional sales from `potential_sales_increase` are added to `total_sales`.
- If `f` equals `n`, all elements in `potential_sales_increase` are considered, up to the maximum possible value.
- If `k_i` equals `l_i` for all days, `potential_sales_increase` will be empty, resulting in no additional sales from this list.

In summary, the function calculates the total sales considering both regular sales and potential sales increases, with the latter being limited to the top `f` values after sorting.
