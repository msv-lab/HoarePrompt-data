`regular_sales` appends the value `min(k, l)` to the end of the list. The value of `regular_sales` before the operation was a list containing one element which is the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration. After appending, the list will now contain two elements.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`days` is a list of \( n-1 \) tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing two elements both of which are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration, `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements which are either `l - k`, `k`, or another expression depending on the relationship between `k` and `l`.**
