Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `days` is a list containing a single tuple `(`k`, `l`)]`.
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
   - `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`.
   - The values of `k` and `l` are input integers.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The loop runs `n` times using `range(n)`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Each iteration of the loop does not change the state of `days`, `n`, or `f` based on the given information.
   - The loop itself does not modify these variables; it only iterates `n` times.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `n` remains unchanged because the loop has completed exactly once, and `n` was initialized to a specific value within the range `[1, 10^5]`.

5. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must still hold true.
   - Since `n` is a fixed integer (unchanged from its initial value), the only condition to check is whether the loop is about to run its final iteration or if there are more iterations left.
   - If the loop has just completed its first iteration, then `n` is still within its valid range and the loop will run one more time unless `n` is reduced to 0.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `n` is not changed by the loop body, it remains the same as its initial value.
   - The list `days` is not modified, so it remains as `[(`k`, `l`)]`.
   - `f` is not mentioned as being affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

7. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, if `n` was initially some value \( x \), after the first iteration, `n` becomes \( x - 1 \).

Given the above reasoning:

**State: `days` is `[(`k`, `l`)]`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `n` is decremented by 1, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n` and remains unchanged.**

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`days` is `[(`k`, `l`)]`, `n` is an integer such that `0 < n ≤ 10^5` and `n` is decremented by 1, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n` and remains unchanged.**
