The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it implies that there are certain constraints and relationships that need to be considered based on the provided context. Specifically, there are integers `n` and `f` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(0 \leq f \leq n\). Additionally, for each \(i\) in the range \(n\), there are integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\).

Given these conditions, the function's output will depend on the values of `n`, `f`, \(k_i\), and \(l_i\), but the function itself does not explicitly take these values as parameters.

Based on the given information, the function likely processes these values in some way to produce a result. Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the accepted constraints and the nature of the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints that `n` and `f` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(0 \leq f \leq n\), and for each \(i\) in the range \(n\), \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) are integers such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\).**
