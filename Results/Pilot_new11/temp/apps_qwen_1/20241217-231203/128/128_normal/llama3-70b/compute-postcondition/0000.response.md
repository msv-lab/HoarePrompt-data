`n` and `f` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `f` are both integers, and the values of `k_i` and `l_i` (for each `i` in range `n`) are not defined yet. The previous conditions on `n` and `f` are preserved.

Output State: **`n` and `f` are integers, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; the values of `k_i` and `l_i` (for each `i` in range `n`) are undefined.**
