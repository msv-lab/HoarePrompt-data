The code `k, l = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `k` and `l`. The initial state includes that `days` is an empty list, and `n` and `f` are integers with the constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ f ≤ n`. After executing the code, the variables `n` and `f` remain unchanged, but `k` and `l` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`days` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `k` is an integer read from input, `l` is an integer read from input**
