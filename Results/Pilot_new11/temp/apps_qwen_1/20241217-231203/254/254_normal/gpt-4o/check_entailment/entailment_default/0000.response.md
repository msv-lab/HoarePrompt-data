Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the GCD of the three input values \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) is 1. While this is a necessary condition for the problem, it is not sufficient. For Mishka to ensure that at least one garland is lit every second after switching them on, the GCD must be 1, but additional constraints must also be met.

To understand why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Example:**
- Input: \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 2\), \(k_3 = 2\)

According to the code, the GCD of \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) is 2, and since 2 is not 1, the output will be 'NO'. However, it is possible to light up every second by choosing the following times:
- Switch on the first garland at second 1.
- Switch on the second garland at second 2.
- Switch on the third garland at second 1.

In this case, the garlands will be lit as follows:
- Garland 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
- Garland 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
- Garland 3: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...

This means that every second after the first two seconds (i.e., seconds 3, 4, 5, ...) is covered. Therefore, the GCD being 2 is not a sufficient condition.

The code fails to check if the combination of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\) can ensure that every second is covered, which is a critical part of the problem description. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making the program incorrect.
