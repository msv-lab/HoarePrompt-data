Functionality: **The function takes three positive integers \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) as input, each constrained to be between 1 and 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), then finds the GCD of this result and \(k_3\). If the final GCD is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values are outside the specified range (less than 1 or greater than 1500), the program behavior is undefined because the code relies on the inputs being within the given constraints. No handling for such cases is present.
- The function assumes valid integer inputs; if non-integer values are provided, the `map(int, input().split())` line would raise a `ValueError`. No error handling for non-integer inputs is included.
- The function does not provide any feedback or handle scenarios where the GCD calculation fails due to invalid input types or values.
