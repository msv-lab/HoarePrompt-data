Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. If the GCD is 1, it means that the intervals are coprime, ensuring that every second can be covered by at least one of the intervals, satisfying the condition that Mishka needs to switch on the garlands.

The annotated version of the code provides clear states at different points, confirming that the program correctly computes the GCDs and makes the appropriate decision based on the GCD value. There is no contradiction or error identified in the program's logic or implementation based on the provided annotations and problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
