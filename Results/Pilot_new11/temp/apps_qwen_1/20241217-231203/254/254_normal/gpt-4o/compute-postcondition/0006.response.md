The code prints 'NO', but it does not affect the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and `gcd_all` is not equal to 1; 'NO' is printed**
