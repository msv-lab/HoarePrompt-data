The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2` using `math.gcd(k1, k2)`. The GCD function takes two arguments and returns their GCD. After the calculation, `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned this value, while `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state where `k1` and `k2` are integers read from input, each between 1 and 1500, and no specific values are provided, we denote the GCD of `k1` and `k2` as `gcd_k1_k2`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`**
