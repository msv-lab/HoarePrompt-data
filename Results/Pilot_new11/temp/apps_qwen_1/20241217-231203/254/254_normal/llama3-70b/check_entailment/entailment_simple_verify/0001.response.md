Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given intervals using a flawed approach. Specifically, the formula used to compute `lcm` is incorrect. The LCM of three numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` cannot be directly computed by multiplying them and dividing by their pairwise GCDs. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For instance, consider the input `(2, 2, 3)`:
- The program calculates `lcm` as `k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`.
- For `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, `func_1(k1, k2) = 2`, `func_1(k2, k3) = 1`, and `func_1(k1, k3) = 1`.
- Therefore, `lcm = 2 * 2 * 3 // (2 * 1 * 1) = 6`.
- Since `6 % 2 == 0`, `6 % 2 == 0`, and `6 % 3 == 0`, the program prints 'YES', which is incorrect because the correct answer should be 'NO'.

The annotated version supports this reasoning by showing that the function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD, but the overall approach to calculating the LCM is flawed. Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all inputs.
