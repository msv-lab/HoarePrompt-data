Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program attempts to use the LCM to solve the problem but contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, `func_1` incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. Since the GCD is crucial for correctly calculating the LCM, this error invalidates the entire logic of the program. The output hints confirm this issue by noting that `func_1` should return the GCD but currently returns `0`, leading to incorrect LCM calculations and, ultimately, incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
