According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, and `k_3` are integers such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq 1500\) for \(i \in \{1, 2, 3\}\). Since `b` being non-zero ensures the loop can execute, we need to adjust `b` to a non-zero value.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to ensure `b` is non-zero.

State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 1500\), `b` must be non-zero, and `k_3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\)**
