In the initial state, `a` is 0 and `b` is the original non-zero value of `a`. Given this, `b` must be 0 since `a` is initially 0. However, the problem states that `b` is the original non-zero value of `a`, which implies there was a contradiction because `a` cannot be both 0 and have a non-zero original value simultaneously under normal circumstances.

Despite this contradiction, let's proceed with the assumption that the code intends to change the values of `a` and `b` according to the provided assignment. The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` means that `a` will take the value of `b`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`.

Given `a` is 0 and `b` is 0 (since `b` is originally the non-zero value of `a`, which is 0 in this context), the calculation `a % b` results in `0 % 0`, which is undefined in many programming languages due to division by zero. However, assuming a context where such a case is handled, typically the remainder of 0 divided by any number is 0.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `a` will be assigned the value of `b`, which is 0.
- `b` will be assigned the value of `0 % 0`, which is 0.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0**
