Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the standard input. It then creates a list of indices where the characters in `s` are lowercase letters and prints the length of this list. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include invalid input types for `n` and `s`, and the function will handle these by attempting to process the input as specified. If `n` is not within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, the function will still proceed and ignore this parameter, focusing solely on counting the lowercase letters in `s`.**
