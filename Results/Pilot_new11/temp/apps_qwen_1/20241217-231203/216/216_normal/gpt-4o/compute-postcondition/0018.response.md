The `current_count` variable is incremented by 1. Since `current_count` was initially 0 (or would remain 0 if `char` was not previously in `current_set` or was not lowercase), after this increment, its value becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, and `current_set`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` contains all the characters it originally contained plus `char`, and `current_count` is 1.**
