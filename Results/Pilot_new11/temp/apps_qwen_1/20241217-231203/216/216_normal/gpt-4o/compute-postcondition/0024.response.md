Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \).
   - \( s \) is a non-empty string.
   - \( max_count \) is 1.
   - \( current_set \) is an empty set.
   - \( current_count \) is 0.
   - If `char` is a lowercase character, `current_set` contains all the characters it originally contained plus `char`, and `current_count` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` contains all the characters it originally contained plus `char`, and `current_count` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for char in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.
   - If `char` is a lowercase character, `current_set` is updated to include `char`, and `current_count` is incremented to 1.
   - If `char` is not a lowercase character (or if the condition doesn't meet), `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` is updated to include `char`, and `current_count` is incremented to 1.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the character `char` has already been processed.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more character left in the string `s`.
   - Therefore, `s` must contain at least two characters now.
   - `char` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `current_set` will be updated to include `char`.
   - `current_count` will be incremented to 1.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` must now have at least one character remaining.
   - `char` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `current_set` will include the previous `current_set` and the new `char`.
   - `current_count` will be 1.

Given this analysis, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \), `s` must have at least one character remaining, `char` will be the next character in `s`, `current_set` will include the previous `current_set` and the new `char`, `current_count` is 1**.
