The code `print(max_count)` simply prints the value of the variable `max_count`, which is currently 0. This does not change the value of `max_count`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
