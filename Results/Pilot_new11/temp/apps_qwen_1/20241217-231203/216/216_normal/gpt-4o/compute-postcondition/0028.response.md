The code updates `max_count` to be the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is initially 1, `max_count` will be updated to 1 if `max_count` was less than 1 before this line of code, or will remain unchanged if `max_count` was already 1 or greater.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `char`, and `current_set`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \); `s` must have at least one character remaining; `char` will be the next character in `s`; `current_set` will include the previous `current_set` and the new `char`; `max_count` is 1 (or remains unchanged if it was already 1 or greater).
