According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `max_count` remains 0.
- `current_set` is a set containing at least one unique character plus `char` if `char` is lowercase, otherwise `current_set` is an empty set.
- `current_count` is 1 if `char` is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, otherwise it remains 0.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens in the loop body. Specifically, the loop body processes the next character in `s`.

Let's break down the relevant parts of the loop body:

1. The current character `char` is processed.
2. `current_count` is updated based on whether `char` is lowercase and not already in `current_set`.
3. If `char` is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, `current_set` is updated to include `char`.

Given that the loop body processes the next character in `s`, the next character (`char_next`) will be processed in the next iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the current character (`char`) has been processed, so the next character (`char_next`) will be the character that was just processed. Therefore, `char` becomes `char_next`.

The other variables remain the same because the loop has not yet processed the next character.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` is a set containing at least one unique character plus `char_next` if `char_next` is lowercase, otherwise `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` remains 0 if `char_next` is not lowercase or is already in `current_set`, otherwise it is 1.**
