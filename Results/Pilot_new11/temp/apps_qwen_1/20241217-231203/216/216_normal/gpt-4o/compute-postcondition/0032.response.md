Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters found in `s`, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- It keeps track of the current set of unique lowercase characters (`current_set`) and the count of these characters (`current_count`).
- When a new character is a lowercase letter and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
- If the character is not a lowercase letter, it updates `max_count` to the maximum of its current value and `current_count`, then resets `current_set` and `current_count`.

After all iterations, the loop ensures that `max_count` holds the highest count of consecutive unique lowercase characters found in `s`. Since the loop resets `current_set` and `current_count` when encountering a non-lowercase character, they will both be 0 at the end of the loop unless the string ends with a sequence of lowercase characters.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
