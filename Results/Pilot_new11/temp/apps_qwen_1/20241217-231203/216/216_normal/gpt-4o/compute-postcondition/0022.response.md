`current_count` is reassigned the value 0, which is its original value. Therefore, no new state is created, and the previous state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
