The `current_set.clear()` method clears all elements from `current_set`. This means that `current_set` will no longer contain any elements after this line of code is executed. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `char`, and `max_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \); `s` must have at least one character remaining; `char` will be the next character in `s`; `current_set` is empty; `max_count` is 1 (or remains unchanged if it was already 1 or greater)**
