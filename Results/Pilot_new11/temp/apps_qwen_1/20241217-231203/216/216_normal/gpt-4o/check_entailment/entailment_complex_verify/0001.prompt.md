You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are no lowercase letters in the string. According to the problem description, if the string does not contain any lowercase letters, the output should be `0`. However, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
3
ABC
```

The program will execute as follows:
- It reads `n = 3` and the string `s = 'ABC'`.
- It iterates through each character:
  - 'A' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
  - 'B' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
  - 'C' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
- After the loop, `max_count` will still be `0`, which is the correct output for this case.

However, the program should output `0` in this case, but it will output `0` correctly in this specific run due to the nature of the loop. But it fails to explicitly check if the string has any lowercase letters before proceeding with the loop, which is necessary to return `0` if no lowercase letters are present. A fix would be to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if there are any lowercase letters in the string.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters found in `s`, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a given string `s` to find the maximum number of consecutive unique lowercase characters. It reads an integer `n` (though `n` is not used in the function), then iterates through each character in `s`. If a character is lowercase and not already in the current set of characters, it is added to the set and the count of unique characters increases. If the character is uppercase, the function resets the count of unique characters and clears the set. After processing all characters, it prints the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters found in the string `s`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the global variables `n` and `s`. Potential edge cases include an empty string `s` or `n` outside the specified range, although the code does not enforce these constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
