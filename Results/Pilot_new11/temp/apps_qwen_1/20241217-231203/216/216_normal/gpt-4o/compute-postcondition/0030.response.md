The code initializes `current_count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, or `max_count`. The only change is that `current_count` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \); `s` must have at least one character remaining; `char` will be the next character in `s`; `current_set` is empty; `max_count` is 1 (or remains unchanged if it was already 1 or greater); `current_count` is 0**
