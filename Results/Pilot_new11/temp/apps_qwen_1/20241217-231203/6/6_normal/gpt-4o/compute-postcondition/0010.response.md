The code assigns the value of `abs(pos - l)` to the variable `move_to_l`. Since the exact values of `pos` and `l` are not specified, `abs(pos - l)` represents the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`.

The conditions provided are:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.
- The condition `(r == n)` is false.

These conditions remain valid after the code execution. The only new information is the value of `move_to_l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`**
