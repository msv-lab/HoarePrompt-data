The code prints the value of `close_both_sides`. Since `close_both_sides` is already calculated before the print statement, the value of `close_both_sides` remains unchanged after the print statement. The print statement itself does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` and the value of `close_both_sides` is printed.**
