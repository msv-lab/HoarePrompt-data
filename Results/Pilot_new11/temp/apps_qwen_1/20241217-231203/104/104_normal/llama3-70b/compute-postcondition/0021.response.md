First, let's analyze the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `j + 1`, which implies `j` is incremented by 1.
- `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - i - 1`.

Now, let's consider the code snippet:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

This line updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `j - i - 1`.

Let's determine the values of `i` and `j` based on the initial state:
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i = n - 2`.
- `j` was incremented by 1, so `j = j + 1`.

Now, we need to find the value of `j - i - 1`:
- Substituting the values of `i` and `j`, we get `j - i - 1 = (j + 1) - (n - 2) - 1 = j + 1 - n + 2 - 1 = j - n + 2`.

Therefore, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `j - n + 2`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, we will represent `j - n + 2` as a general expression.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - n + 2`.**
