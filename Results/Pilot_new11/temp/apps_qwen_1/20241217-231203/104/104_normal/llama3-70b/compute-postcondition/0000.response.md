`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer input from the user. The value of `n` is within the range 1 to 100, as specified in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user (within the range 1 to 100), and all other variables are unchanged.**
