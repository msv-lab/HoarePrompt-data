Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 1` (if the loop did not execute at all), otherwise `j` is the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.**
