Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, and `j` is the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied. `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.** 

Explanation:
- The variable `i` starts at `n - 2`.
- The variable `j` is incremented in each iteration of the loop until the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` is no longer satisfied.
- The variable `max_erase` keeps track of the maximum value of `j - i - 1` found during the loop executions.

Since the loop runs until `j` reaches a point where the condition is no longer satisfied, the final value of `j` is the last value for which the condition held true. The final value of `max_erase` is the greatest difference between the length of the subarray (from `i` to `j-1`) minus 1 that satisfies the condition.
