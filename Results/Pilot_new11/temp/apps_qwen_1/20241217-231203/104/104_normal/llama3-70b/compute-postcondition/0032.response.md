Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `total` is 0
- `i` is an integer
- `n` must be greater than `i`
- `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1` (regardless of the condition being true or false)

### For Loop
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `n`.
2. **Current Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer
   - `n` must be greater than `i`
   - `max_erase` has been updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be such that it satisfies the range `i + 1` to `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, let's assume `j` was `j_old` and `max_erase` was updated accordingly.
   - In the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1, so the new `j` will be `j_old + 1`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - `total` remains unchanged: `total` is still 0.
   - `i` remains the same: `i` is still the same integer.
   - `n` remains the same: `n` is still greater than `i`.
   - `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`.

### Updated State
- `total` is still 0
- `i` remains the same integer
- `n` must still be greater than `i`
- `max_erase` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`.

### Final State
Given that `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, we need to update `max_erase` accordingly.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j_old + 1 - i - 1`**.

To express this clearly:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1` where `j` is now `j_old + 1**.
