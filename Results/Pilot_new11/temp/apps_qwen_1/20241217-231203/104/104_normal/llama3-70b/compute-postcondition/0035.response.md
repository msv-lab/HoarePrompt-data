Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is greater than `i`.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`.
   - The condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` must hold for the loop to continue.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` in this range, the loop checks if `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true.
   - If true, the loop continues with the next `j`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the last value that satisfied the condition.
   - The next `j` must be `j + 1` (since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1).
   - Therefore, `j` becomes `j + 1`.
   - `max_erase` updates based on the new `j` value as `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increases by 1, the next `j` will be `i + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration will be checked with `j = i + 2`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration will be `i` remains the same, `n` must still be greater than `i`, `max_erase` updates, and the condition needs to be checked with the new `j = i + 2`.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1` where `j_old` is `i + 1` and the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, i + 2)))` must hold for the loop to continue.**

So, the final state is:
**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and 1. The condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, i + 2)))` must hold for the loop to continue.**
