The code initializes the variable `max_erase` to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. The initial state of `n` being an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100 and `a` being a list of integers created from the user input remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100; `a` is a list of integers created from the user input; `max_erase` is 0**
