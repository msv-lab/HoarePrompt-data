Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds, the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, i + 2)))` must also hold.**
