Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, then the condition `(a[k] - a[i] == k - i)` holds for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`.**
