To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop and analyze the conditions under which it would run.

Given for loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs through the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, the range `(i + 1, n + 1)` must be non-empty, meaning there should be at least one integer in this range.

2. **Range Analysis:**
   - The range is defined as `i + 1` to `n + 1`, inclusive.
   - To ensure there is at least one integer in this range, we need `n + 1` to be greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - Simplify the condition `n + 1 > i + 1` to `n > i`.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - The initial state is given as "State before the for loop: `total` is 0."
   - This information about `total` is irrelevant to the loop condition.
   - The relevant variables for the loop condition are `i` and `n`.

5. **Required States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than `i`**
