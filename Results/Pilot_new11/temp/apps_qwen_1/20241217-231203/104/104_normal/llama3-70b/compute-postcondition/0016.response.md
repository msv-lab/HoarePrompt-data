Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `j` is `n + 1` if the loop does not execute at all; otherwise, `j` is the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to start, the initial value of `j` must be within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - Given `i = n - 2`, the smallest possible value for `j` when the loop starts would be `i + 1 = (n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be at least `n - 1` to satisfy the loop condition.

4. **Final State of Variables:**
   - After the loop, `j` should be the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied.
   - `max_erase` should be updated to the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `j` to at least `n - 1`.
   - Since the loop updates `j` based on the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))`, we do not need to adjust `a`, but we need to ensure that the initial state allows the loop to start.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 1` or more, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.**

Note: The initial value of `j` is set to `n - 1` to ensure the loop starts. As the loop progresses, `j` will be updated based on the condition, but this ensures the loop can begin.
