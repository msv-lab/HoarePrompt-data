Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers \(a_i\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)), ensuring that each element \(a_i\) is strictly increasing and lies within the range \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\). It aims to find the maximum number of elements that can be erased from the list such that the remaining elements still maintain a strictly increasing order. Specifically, for every subarray of consecutive elements, it checks if the difference between each pair of elements is equal to their index difference. If such a subarray is found, it calculates the maximum length of such subarrays minus one (since we are erasing elements, not keeping them), and updates the maximum erase count accordingly. The function then prints the maximum number of elements that can be erased.**

This summary covers all the logical steps performed by the function and includes an edge case where no valid subarray is found, leading to a maximum erase count of 0.
