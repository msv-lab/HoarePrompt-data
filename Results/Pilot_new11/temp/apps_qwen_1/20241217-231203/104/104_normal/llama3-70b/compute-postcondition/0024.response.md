First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `(j + 1) - n + 2`.
- Code: `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = n - 2`
- `j = j + 1` (This implies `j` is updated to `j + 1`)
- `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `(j + 1) - n + 2`.

Now, let's substitute the values into the code:
- `j - i - 1` becomes \((j + 1) - (n - 2) - 1 = j + 1 - n + 2 - 1 = j - n + 2\).

So, the code becomes:
- `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - n + 2)`

After executing this line, `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and \(j - n + 2\).

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` remains `n - 2`
- `j` is updated to `j + 1`
- `max_erase` is updated to `max(max_erase, j - n + 2)`

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - n + 2`**
