The code `print(max_erase)` simply prints the value of `max_erase` but does not change its value or assign it any new value. Therefore, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged after the execution of this line.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1` for all valid `i` (where `1 <= i < n`)**
