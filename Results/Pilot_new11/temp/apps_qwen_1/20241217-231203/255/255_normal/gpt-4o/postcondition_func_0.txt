The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) from the user. It then counts the number of positions \( i \) (from 1 to \( n-1 \)) where the character at position \( i \) in the string is different from the character at position \( i-1 \). Finally, it prints the total count of such positions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
