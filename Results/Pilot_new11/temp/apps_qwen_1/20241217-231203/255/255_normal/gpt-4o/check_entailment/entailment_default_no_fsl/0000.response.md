Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code simply counts the number of positions where consecutive characters are different, which does not account for contiguous substrings of identical characters that can be deleted. For example, consider the input:

Input
```
5
aaaaa
```

The expected output should be `1` because we can delete the entire string in one operation. However, the current code would output `4`, which is incorrect. The code fails to handle the case where multiple identical characters form a contiguous substring that can be deleted in a single operation.
