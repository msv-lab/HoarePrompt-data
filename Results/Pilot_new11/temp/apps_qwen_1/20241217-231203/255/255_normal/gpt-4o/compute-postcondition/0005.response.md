The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The other variables (`n`, `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 < n â‰¤ 500, `s` is a string input by the user with a length equal to `n`, `operations` is 2, and for some index `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s`.**
