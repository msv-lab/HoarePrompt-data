Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) as input. It then iterates through the string \( s \) to count the number of distinct consecutive pairs of characters. The function prints the count of these distinct pairs. If two consecutive characters in the string are different, the count \( ans \) is incremented. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value; instead, it performs the counting operation internally and prints the result. Potential edge cases include when the string \( s \) consists of all the same characters, resulting in a count of 0, or when \( s \) is empty, in which case the function will print 0 since there are no pairs to compare.**
