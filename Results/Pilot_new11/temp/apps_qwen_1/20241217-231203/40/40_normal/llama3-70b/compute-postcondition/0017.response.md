Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr != substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution and Variable Changes:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(i + 1, n + 1)`.
   - For each iteration, it creates a substring `substr` of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`.
   - It checks if the substring `substr` is not a palindrome.
   - If `substr` is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum of `max_len` and the length of `substr`.

2. **Final State Determination:**
   - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - During each iteration, `j` will take values from `i+1` to `n`, creating substrings of `s` starting from `i` and ending at each possible `j` within this range.
   - If a substring is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to store the length of the longest such substring encountered.
   - If no non-palindromic substrings are found, `max_len` will remain 0.

3. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `max_len` will be the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s` that satisfies the condition in the loop. If no such substring exists, `max_len` will remain 0.
   - `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop increments `j` up to `n` for each `i`.

### Final Output State:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s` that starts from any index `i` and ends at any index `j` (where `i < j` and `j <= n`). If no such substring exists, `max_len` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1` (after the loop completes).

### Output State:
**Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s` that starts from any index `i` and ends at any index `j` (where `i < j` and `j <= n`), if no such substring exists `max_len` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**
