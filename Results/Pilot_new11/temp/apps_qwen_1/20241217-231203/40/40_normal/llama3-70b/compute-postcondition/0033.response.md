According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes
- `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop's condition:
- The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.

Since `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes, it remains unchanged. The values of `j` and `max_len` also remain the same.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`**
