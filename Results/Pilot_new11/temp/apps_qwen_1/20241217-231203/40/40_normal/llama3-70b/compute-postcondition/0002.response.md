The code initializes `max_len` to 0. This does not affect the value of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of `s` and `n`, and the newly assigned value of `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0**
