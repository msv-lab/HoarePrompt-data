The code snippet updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` and is not equal to its reverse, the length of `substr` (`len(substr)`) remains unchanged, but `max_len` is now updated to the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the length of `substr`.

- The length of `substr` is known to be between 1 and the length of `s` because `i` and `j` are defined such that `i <= j <= len(s)`.
- Since `max_len` was initially 0 and `substr` is a non-empty substring, `max_len` will be updated to the length of `substr`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is equal to the length of `substr`, `i` must be less than `n`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is equal to the length of `substr`, `i` must be less than `n`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse)**
