The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` to the variable `substr`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. The initial state specifies that `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`. After executing this line of code, `substr` will hold this substring.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and `j - i` (since `substr` is not equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`.**
