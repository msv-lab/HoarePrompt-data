Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n + 1`, `substr` is the substring `s[i:j]`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible substrings starting from index `i` (which is 4) up to `n`.
- For each iteration, `substr` is the substring `s[i:j]`, where `j` increases from `i+1` to `n+1`.
- If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1`, and `max_len` will hold the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`.

Since the loop does not update `total` or `i` other than setting `i` initially, these values remain unchanged. `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to start. `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, and `substr` will be the last substring checked, which is `s[i:n+1]` but since `j` is `n + 1`, it essentially means the substring is `s[i:n]`.

The final value of `max_len` will be the longest substring found that is not equal to its reverse.
