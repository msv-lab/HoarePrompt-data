The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` attempts to slice the string `s` from index `i` to index `j`. However, the values of `j` are not specified in the initial state. Since `i` must be less than `n`, and `n` is a positive integer, the value of `j` could be any integer such that `i <= j <= len(s)`. Without a specific value for `j`, we cannot determine the exact content of `substr`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` must be less than `n`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`)**
