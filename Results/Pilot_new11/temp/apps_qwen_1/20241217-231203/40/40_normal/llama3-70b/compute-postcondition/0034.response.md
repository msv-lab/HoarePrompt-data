Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes
   - `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `n`.
   - This means the loop will start when `j` is `i + 1`, which is `5` in this case (`i` is `4`).

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be greater than `i`, i.e., `j` must be at least `5`.
   - Since `n` is the final value after the loop completes, it must be at least `5` for the loop to start.

4. **Final Values After Loop Completion**:
   - The loop will continue until `j` exceeds `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `5` for the loop to run at least once.
   - `i` remains `4` throughout the loop.
   - `j` will take values starting from `5` up to `n`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure `i` is `4`.
   - Ensure `n` is at least `5` to allow the loop to start.
   - `j` will increment within the range, but we need to ensure the loop can start, so `n` must be at least `5`.

Based on the above analysis, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` is `4`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `5`
- `j` will start from `5` and increment accordingly

Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` will start from 5**
