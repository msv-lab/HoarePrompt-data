Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single non-empty string `s` from the input, which is within the specified constraints (length at most 50 characters).

2. **Substring Extraction and Palindrome Check**:
   - It uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
   - For each substring, it checks whether the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).
   - If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum length of such a substring found so far.

3. **Output**: After processing all substrings, the program prints the maximum length of a non-palindrome substring found. If no such substring exists, it prints `0`.

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies and tracks the longest non-palindrome substring.
   - It handles the case where all substrings are palindromes by setting `max_len` to `0`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the input string is a palindrome (e.g., "mew" in the first example) by finding the entire string as the longest non-palindrome substring.
   - It correctly handles cases where no non-palindrome substrings exist (e.g., "qqqqqqqq") by printing `0`.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
