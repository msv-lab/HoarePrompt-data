According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 4
- `substr` is not equal to its reverse
- `max_len` is the length of `substr`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range of `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since `i` is 3, the loop will start with `j = 4` (as `j` is incremented by 1 each time). `n` must be at least 4.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should start from 4 and `n` must still be at least 4.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, and `j` is 4**
