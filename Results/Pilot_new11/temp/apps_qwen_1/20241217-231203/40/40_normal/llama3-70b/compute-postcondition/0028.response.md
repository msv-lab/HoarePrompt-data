Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `j` is 4
   - `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4
   - `max_len` is 2

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - Given `i` is 3, the loop condition is `j` in the range from 4 to `n`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 5 (or any value greater than 4 up to `n`).

4. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4.
   - `max_len` is 2 and does not change if `substr` is not equal to its reverse.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `total` remains 0 as it was not modified in the loop.
   - `i` remains 3 as it was not modified in the loop.
   - `n` remains at least 4.
   - `j` needs to be 5 for the loop to execute again.
   - `substr` remains the same substring from index 3 to index 4.
   - `max_len` remains 2.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `j` must be 5
   - `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4
   - `max_len` is 2

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 5, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, and `max_len` is 2**.
