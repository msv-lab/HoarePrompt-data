Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the longest non-palindromic substring in a given string. The function iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If a substring is not a palindrome, its length is compared with the current maximum length, and the maximum length is updated accordingly. Finally, the function prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found, or 0 if no such substring exists.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly processes all possible substrings and updates the maximum length only if a non-palindromic substring is found. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through all substrings and returning the correct length based on whether they are palindromes or not.

Given the examples provided in the problem description, the code works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
