`max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is `j - i`, which is `2` since `j` is `i + 2`. Therefore, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and 2, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`**.
