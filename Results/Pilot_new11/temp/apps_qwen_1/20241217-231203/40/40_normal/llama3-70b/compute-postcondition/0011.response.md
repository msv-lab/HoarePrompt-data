The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is defined as a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`, the length of `substr` is `j - i`.

Here are the steps to determine the new state:

1. The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_len`) and the length of `substr` (`j - i`).

2. All other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and `j - i`, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` (where `i <= j-1 <= len(s)`).**
