Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is either equal to the length of `substr` (if `substr` is not equal to its reverse) or remains 0 (if `substr` is equal to its reverse).
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`).

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within this range.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is currently at the end of the previous iteration, which means `j` is equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i + 1` and ends at `n`.
   - To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 1`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `j` is incremented to `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, and `substr` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, which is not specified here.

### Final State:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is either equal to the length of `substr` (if `substr` is not equal to its reverse) or remains 0 (if `substr` is equal to its reverse).
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `j` is now `i + 1`.
- `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`).

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the length of `substr` (if `substr` is not equal to its reverse) or remains 0 (if `substr` is equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`).**
