Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the golden system comparison as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only computes the value of a single number in the golden system but does not compare two numbers. Instead, it should compare the decimal values of the two numbers directly using the same method.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a single number in the golden system, but it does not perform any comparison between two numbers.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The main part of the code reads two numbers and calls `func_1` on both, but it fails to compare the results. It simply prints the result of the comparison of the two computed values, which is not what the problem requires.

To fix this, the code needs to be modified to compare the two numbers directly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value

value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)

if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')
```

This corrected code computes the decimal values of both numbers and compares them correctly, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
