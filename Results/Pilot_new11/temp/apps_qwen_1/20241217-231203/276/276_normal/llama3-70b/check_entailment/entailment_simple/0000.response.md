Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires comparing two numbers represented in the "golden system" (base-q) and determining which one has a larger decimal value.
   - The golden system uses the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) as its base.
   - The decimal value of a number in the golden system is computed using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \).

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The program reads two strings from the input, each representing a number in the golden system.
   - It converts these strings to their decimal values using the `func_1` function.
   - It compares the decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on the comparison result.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a single string `s` representing a number in the golden system.
   - It calculates the decimal value by iterating over the reversed string and computing the sum of each digit multiplied by the corresponding power of \( q \).
   - The loop correctly computes the decimal value for the given golden system number.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program assumes the input strings are non-empty and consist only of '0' and '1'.
   - It handles all valid inputs as per the problem statement without any additional error checking for invalid inputs, which aligns with the problem constraints.

Since the program accurately performs the required conversion from the golden system to decimal and correctly compares the decimal values of the two numbers, it meets the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
