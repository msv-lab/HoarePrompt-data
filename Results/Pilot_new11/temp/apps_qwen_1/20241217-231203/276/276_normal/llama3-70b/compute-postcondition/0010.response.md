The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system. The function returns the sum of the integer value of each character 'c' in the string 's' multiplied by its positional factor 'q', where 'q' is calculated as the length of 's' minus the current iteration count.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and return the sum of each character's value (considering '0' as 0 and '1' as 1) multiplied by its positional factor, which is the length of the string minus the current iteration count.
