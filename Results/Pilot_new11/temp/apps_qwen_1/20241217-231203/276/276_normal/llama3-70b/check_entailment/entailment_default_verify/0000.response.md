Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a number from the "golden system" to its decimal value using the given formula. The function `func_1` iterates over the reversed string, calculates the weighted sum of each character using the golden ratio, and returns the decimal value. The main part of the program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on their comparison. Given the output hints, the program functionality matches the problem description, and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle within the constraints provided. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
