The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. The length of this list is a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100 000. 

Case_1: If any tuple in the list does not contain exactly two positive integers, the function returns an error message indicating the input is invalid.

Case_2: If all tuples contain exactly two positive integers, the function returns the total volume of all cakes calculated from their radii and heights.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the radius and height of a cake, and return the total volume of all cakes if the input is valid, or an error message if the input is invalid.
