Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `cakes` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000). It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`. Then, it uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices 0 to i-2 for each i from 0 to n-1. This is stored in a list called `dp`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the optimal way to select cakes to maximize the sum of their volumes considering the subproblem constraints.**

**Potential edge cases include:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will simply return the volume of the single cake since no subproblems need to be considered.
- If `cakes` is an empty list, the function will return 0 since there are no cakes to consider.
- The function assumes that all inputs are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000), and if these conditions are not met, the behavior is undefined.
