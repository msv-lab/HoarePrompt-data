Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is `n`
   - The condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` was not met (since `j` is `n` and the loop runs from `0` to `i-1`, `j` cannot be `i` or greater).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - Since `i` is `n`, the loop will run from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `j` will take on values from `0` to `n-1` until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` needs to be checked.
   - If this condition is true, the state will be updated based on the given rule.
   - If this condition is false, the state remains unchanged.

5. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is `n`

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will decrease from `n-1` to `0`.
   - The only value `j` can take that hasn't been checked yet is `n-1`.

7. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `j` is now `n-1`, the condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` will be checked with `j = n-1`.
   - If `volumes[n-1] < volumes[n]` is true, the state will be updated.
   - If `volumes[n-1] < volumes[n]` is false, the state remains unchanged.

8. **Updated State**:
   - `i` remains `n`.
   - `j` will be `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` will be checked with `j = n-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`**
