`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]`, and `j` is 1. This means:

- Initially, `dp[0] = volumes[0]`.
- The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the code updates `dp[0]` to be the maximum of its current value (which is `volumes[0]`) and `dp[1] + volumes[0]`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `dp[0]` is `max(volumes[0], dp[1] + volumes[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), and `j` is 1**
