Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` is `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each digit of the ticket until `i` equals `n`.
- During each iteration, `current_sum` accumulates the sum of digits.
- If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, it means a valid segment is found, and both `current_sum` is reset to 0 and `segment_count` is incremented.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop will have processed all `n` digits.
- `current_sum` will be 0 because the loop resets it to 0 whenever a valid segment is found.
- `segment_count` will be the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`.
- `target_sum` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket.
- `segment_length` remains `n` as it is the length specified for each segment.
