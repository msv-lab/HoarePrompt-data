You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly check for all possible segmentations of the ticket. Specifically, the program only checks for segments starting from the beginning of the ticket and moving forward. It does not consider other possible segmentations where segments could start anywhere within the ticket. 

For example, consider the input `6` and the ticket `123123`. The correct answer should be "YES" because the ticket can be divided into segments `12`, `31`, and `23` such that `1+2=3+1=2+3`. However, the provided function only checks for segments starting from the beginning and will miss this valid segmentation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and ticket is a string consisting of n digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `current_sum` is `0`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n-1` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, `segment_length` is `n-1`, and the loop either returns `'YES'` if the condition `(current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1)` is met for any `segment_length`, or continues to check all possible `segment_length` until completion.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive). It checks if there exists a way to split the `ticket` into segments such that the sum of the digits in each segment is equal, and if more than one such segment can be formed. If such a split is possible, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function iterates over all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculates the target sum for each segment length, and then checks if the ticket can be split into segments with that sum. If a valid split is found, it returns 'YES'. If no valid split is found after checking all possible segment lengths, it returns 'NO'. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2, where the function would need to check if the digits in `ticket` are equal. The function also covers the case where the sum of the entire ticket cannot be evenly divided among segments, which would result in a return of 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string consisting of n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ int(digit) ≤ 9 for each digit in the string), start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end' inclusive
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers such that `0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)`. The parameter `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ int(digit) ≤ 9` for each digit in the string. The function calculates and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer value representing the sum of the specified range of digits in the `ticket` string. Potential edge cases include when `start` or `end` are at the boundaries of the string, or when `start` equals `end`, in which case only one digit is summed. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will still execute correctly and return the sum of the specified range, though this is not a typical use case given the precondition `0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)`.
