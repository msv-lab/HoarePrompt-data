Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is the previous value of `current_sum` plus `int(ticket[2])`, `target_sum` is equal to the updated value of `current_sum`, and `segment_count` is 2. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
