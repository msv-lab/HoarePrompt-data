Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments found where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` is 1.** 

Explanation:
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates over the range `range(n)`.
- `current_sum` will be 0 because each time `current_sum` reaches `target_sum`, it is reset to 0 and the counting of segments starts again.
- `segment_count` will be the number of times `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum` during the loop iterations.
- `segment_length` remains 1 because the length of each segment is fixed and does not change within the loop.
