The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. Based on the given cases, the function returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket`, and return 'YES' in multiple cases and 'NO' in another case.
