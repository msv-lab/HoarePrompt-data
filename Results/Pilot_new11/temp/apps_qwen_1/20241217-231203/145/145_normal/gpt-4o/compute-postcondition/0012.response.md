The code sets `current_sum` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `target_sum`, and `segment_count`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to the updated value of `current_sum`, and `segment_count` is 2**
