The code sets `current_sum` to 0, which overwrites its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `segment_length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the first digit of the ticket, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, `segment_length` is 1**
