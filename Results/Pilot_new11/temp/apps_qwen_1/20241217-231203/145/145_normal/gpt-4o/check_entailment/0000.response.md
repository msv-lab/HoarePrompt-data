Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. Specifically, the `segment_sum` function is only used to calculate the sum of a segment once and does not help in breaking down the entire ticket into multiple segments during the main logic. The main function `func_1` attempts to break the ticket into segments but does not ensure that the segments have equal sums.

For example, consider the input:
- **Input**
  ```
  6
  123456
  ```

- **Expected Output**
  ```
  NO
  ```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
- **Output**
  ```
  YES
  ```

This is because the program tries to break the ticket into segments of varying lengths without checking if those segments have equal sums. It checks if the current sum matches the target sum but does not ensure that the total number of segments with equal sums is greater than one.
