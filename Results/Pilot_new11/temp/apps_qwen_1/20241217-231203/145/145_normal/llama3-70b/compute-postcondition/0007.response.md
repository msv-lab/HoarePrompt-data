Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ticket` is a string consisting of exactly \( n \) digits where \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \).
   - Each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
   - `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
   - `curr_sum` is 0.
   - `segments` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one digit in `ticket`.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`, `ticket` must have at least one digit. Given the constraints, `ticket` must have more than 0 digits and less than or equal to 100 digits.
   - `total_sum` being even is a condition for the initial setup but does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `curr_sum` and `segments` are initialized to 0 and do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given this analysis, the critical state to adjust for the loop to execute is that `ticket` must have at least one digit.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 100 digits, each character is a digit between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0**
