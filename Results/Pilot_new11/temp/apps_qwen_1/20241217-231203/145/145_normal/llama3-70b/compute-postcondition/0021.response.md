The code initializes `curr_sum` to 0. This resets the value of `curr_sum` without affecting the other variables. The initial values of `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 99 digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, and `segments` is 4.**
