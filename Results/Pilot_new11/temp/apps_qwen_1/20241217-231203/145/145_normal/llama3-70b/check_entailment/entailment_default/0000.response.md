Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the requirement to check if the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that if the total sum of the digits is even, then the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. This assumption is flawed because it does not ensure that the ticket can actually be divided into multiple segments with equal sums.

For example, consider the input `6` and the ticket `111111`. The total sum of the digits is 6, which is even. However, it is impossible to divide this ticket into two or more segments with equal sums. The function would incorrectly return `True` because the total sum is even, but it fails to check if there are actual segments with equal sums.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to ensure that there are at least two segments with equal sums. The current implementation only checks if the total sum is even and does not validate the existence of such segments. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
