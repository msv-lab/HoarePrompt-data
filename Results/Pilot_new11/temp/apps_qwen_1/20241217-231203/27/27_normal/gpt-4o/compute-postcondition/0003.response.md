The code finds the maximum value from the `expressions` list using a lambda function as the key. The `max` function returns a tuple containing the maximum value and the corresponding expression.

Since the initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are the first, second, and third input floats respectively, and `expressions` is a list of tuples containing the results of various mathematical expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, the `max` function will compare these results to find the maximum value.

After executing the line of code, the variables `max_value` and `max_expr` will be updated with the maximum value and its corresponding expression, respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first input float, `y` is the second input float, `z` is the third input float, `max_value` is the maximum value among the results of the expressions in the `expressions` list, `max_expr` is the tuple containing the maximum value and its corresponding expression.**
