Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - These numbers are then split and converted to floats, ensuring they are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

2. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The program generates 12 different mathematical expressions based on the given values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
   - These expressions are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the calculated value and the corresponding expression string.

3. **Max Value Determination**:
   - The `max` function is used to find the maximum value among the 12 calculated expressions.
   - The second element of the tuple (the expression string) corresponding to this maximum value is printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the expression string that corresponds to the maximum value found.

The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, including:
- The input format (three real numbers with one digit after the decimal point).
- The generation of all 12 possible expressions.
- The determination of the maximum value among these expressions.
- The output of the expression corresponding to the maximum value.

Since the program accurately implements all the required steps without any omissions or deviations, it is correct according to the problem description.
