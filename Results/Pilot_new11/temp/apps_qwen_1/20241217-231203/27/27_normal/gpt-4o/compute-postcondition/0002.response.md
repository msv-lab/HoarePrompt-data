The code creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the result of different mathematical expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, and their corresponding string representations. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged by this code, as no assignment operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`x` is the first input float, `y` is the second input float, `z` is the third input float, expressions is a list of tuples containing the results of various mathematical expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`.**
