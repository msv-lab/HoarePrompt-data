First, let's analyze the initial state of the variables:

- `a1` is `x`
- `a2` is `x`
- `a3` is `x`
- `a4` is `(x`
- `a5` is `y`
- `a6` is `y`
- `a7` is `(y`
- `a8` is `(y`
- `a9` is `z`
- `a10` is `z`
- `a11` is `z`
- `a12` is `(z`
- `a` is `[x, x, x, (x, y, y, (y, y, z, z, z, (z]]`
- `b` is `['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z', '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']`

The code to execute is:
```python
print(b[a.index(max(a))])
```

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. `max(a)` finds the maximum value in the list `a`.
2. Since `a` contains elements like `x`, `(x`, `y`, `(y`, and `z`, the maximum value will be `z` because `z` is lexicographically larger than `x` and `y` when considering the list order.
3. `a.index(max(a))` finds the index of `z` in the list `a`. The value `z` appears at index 8 in the list `a`.
4. `b[8]` accesses the element at index 8 in the list `b`, which is `'z^x^y'`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`'z^x^y'`**
