`a1` is assigned the value of `x ** (y ** z)`. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are determined by the input and are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point within the range of `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`, the value of `a1` will be a floating-point number resulting from the exponentiation operation.

Output State: **`a1` is x ** (y ** z), `x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point.**
