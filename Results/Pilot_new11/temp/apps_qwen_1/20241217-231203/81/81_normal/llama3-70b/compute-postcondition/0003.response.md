The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `b` is set to `a % b`, and now `a` will take the value of the original `b`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`. Given that the GCD of the original `a` and `b` is `d`, the updated values of `a` and `b` after executing the code will still satisfy the condition that their GCD is `d`. 

Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`; `b` is `a % b` and the GCD of the updated `a` (which was the original `b`) and the updated `b` (which was `a % b`) remains `d`.**
