Postcondition: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and \(y\) is divisible by \(x\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and \(y\) is divisible by \(x\), `z` is \(y // x\) and must be at least 1, `count` is 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that \(z \mod i = 0\)**
