`z` is assigned the value of `y // x`. Given the initial state, `y` is divisible by `x`, so the value of `z` will be an integer. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= y <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= y <= 10^9 and y is divisible by x, `z` is y // x**
