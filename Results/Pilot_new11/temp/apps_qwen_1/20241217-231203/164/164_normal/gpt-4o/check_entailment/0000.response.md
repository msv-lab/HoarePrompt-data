Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the grasshopper needs to jump over multiple obstacles or when the target position is not directly reachable within the constraints of `k` jumps. 

Consider the following input:
```
7 3
T..#G..
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 6 ('G') and the target is at position 0 ('T'). With a jump length of 3, the grasshopper would need to jump over the obstacle at position 3, which is not handled correctly by the current implementation. The program would incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks up to the target position without ensuring there are no obstacles in between.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are any obstacles between the current position and the target position for each jump, not just up to the target position.
