The code `G_pos = line.index('G')` finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'G' in the string `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `line`. After executing this line, `G_pos` will be assigned the index of the first 'G' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user, `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`**
