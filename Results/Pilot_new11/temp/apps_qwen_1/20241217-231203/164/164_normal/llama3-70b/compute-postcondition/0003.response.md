State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` being set to 0 and then increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true.
3. Since the loop variable `i` starts at 0, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.
4. There are no initial values given for `g` or `t` that affect the loop's execution, so they remain as `-1`.
5. The variable `k` is not used directly in the loop condition but is mentioned in the constraints (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1), so we include this constraint to ensure the loop can execute within valid conditions.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.
