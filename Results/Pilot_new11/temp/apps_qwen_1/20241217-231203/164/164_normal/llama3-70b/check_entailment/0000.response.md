Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect based on the given constraints. 

1. The program first reads the number of cells `n` and the jump length `k`.
2. It then reads the string representing the line and finds the positions of 'G' and 'T'.
3. It checks if both 'G' and 'T' are found, otherwise it immediately prints 'NO'.
4. It then checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`, ensuring the grasshopper can potentially reach the insect.
5. Finally, it checks that no intermediate cells on the path from 'G' to 'T' are obstacles ('#').

The logic handles all described scenarios correctly, including edge cases like different starting positions, different jump lengths, and obstacles in the way. The provided examples also confirm its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
