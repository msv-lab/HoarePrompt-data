The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 1. Therefore, `g` is updated to 1. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 1, `t` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'T' and -1 otherwise, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
