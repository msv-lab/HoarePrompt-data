`g` and `t` are assigned the value `-1`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is -1; `t` is -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is -1; `t` is -1**
