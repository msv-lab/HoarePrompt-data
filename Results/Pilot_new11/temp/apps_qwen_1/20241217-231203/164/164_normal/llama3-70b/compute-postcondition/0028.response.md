The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, `g` is not -1, `t` is not -1, `abs(t - g) % k != 0` or there exists at least one index `j` in the range `0` to `abs(t - g) // k` such that `s[(g + j * k) % n] == '#'`, print output is 'NO'**
