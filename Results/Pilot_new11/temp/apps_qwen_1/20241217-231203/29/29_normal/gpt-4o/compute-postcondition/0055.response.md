The `temp_counter` variable is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + 3`. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we keep it as `n` in the expression. Therefore, after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 4`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the content of the `moves` variable also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is 2 * n + 4, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
