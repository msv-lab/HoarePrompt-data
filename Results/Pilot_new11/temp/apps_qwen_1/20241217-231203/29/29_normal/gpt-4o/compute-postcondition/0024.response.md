Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The condition for the loop is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `examples` must have at least one file.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
   - The current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to the string `str(0 + 1)`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` must satisfy both parts of the condition: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
   - Given `temp_counter = n + 1`, we need to check if `n + 1` satisfies the condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

4. **Satisfying the Condition**:
   - Since `temp_counter` is initially set to `n + 1`, for the loop to execute, `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `str(n + 1)` is in `files_set` for the loop to proceed.
   - No other state adjustments are necessary as long as `str(n + 1)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `str(n + 1)` is in `files_set`.

State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to the string `str(0 + 1)`, and `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
