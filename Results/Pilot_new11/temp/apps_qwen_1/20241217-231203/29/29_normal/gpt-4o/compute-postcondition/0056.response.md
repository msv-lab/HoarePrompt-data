Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `temp_counter` is \(2 \times n + 4\)
   - `moves` contains the string `'move {examples[1]} 2'`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   ```python
   while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to \(2 \times n\) and the string representation of `temp_counter` is in the `files_set`.

4. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is \(2 \times n + 4\).
   - Since `temp_counter` is already \(2 \times n + 4\), it is not less than or equal to \(2 \times n\). Therefore, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is false, and the loop will not continue.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` becomes true.
   - This means we need to reduce `temp_counter` to a value less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).

6. **Other State Variables**:
   - The values of `i` and `moves` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The `files_set` should still contain the string representation of `temp_counter`, but since `temp_counter` is not within the range anymore, it is not relevant for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `temp_counter` is reduced to a value less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to 2 * n, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
