Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where example files and regular files are intermixed in a way that prevents direct reordering. Specifically, the code attempts to find a temporary position for files within the range `[n, 2*n]` to ensure that example files are moved to positions `[1, e]` and regular files to positions `[e+1, n]`. However, this approach can fail if there are too many files in this range that already have correct names, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect reordering.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 0
2 1
3 0
4 1
5 0
```

The code will attempt to move file `2` (an example) to a temporary position, but if no such position is available, it will try to move it directly to position `1`, causing an infinite loop because the file `1` (a regular file) is already in the correct position.

To handle this case correctly, the code needs to ensure that it can always find a valid temporary position or directly move the file to its correct position without entering an infinite loop.
