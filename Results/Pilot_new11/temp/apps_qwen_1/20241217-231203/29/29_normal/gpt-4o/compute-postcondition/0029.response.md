`temp_counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n + 3` (where `n` is at least 3) to `n + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `n + 4`, the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to `str(1)`, and `str(n + 3)` must be in `files_set`**
