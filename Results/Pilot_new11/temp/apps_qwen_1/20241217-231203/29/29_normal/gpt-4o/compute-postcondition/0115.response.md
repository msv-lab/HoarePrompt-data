Postcondition: ***`i` is 9, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or such that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` plus 1, `examples` remains as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `moves` includes the move operations `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'` and `f'move {regulars[8]} {temp_counter}'`, `len(regulars)` is greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 17.***
