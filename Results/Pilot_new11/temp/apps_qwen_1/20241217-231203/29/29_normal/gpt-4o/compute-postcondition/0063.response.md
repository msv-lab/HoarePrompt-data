`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is 5, so after incrementing, `temp_counter` becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `moves` is ['move example1 5'], `examples` is ['5', 'example2', 'example3'], `temp_counter` is 6.

Output State: **`moves` is ['move example1 5'], `examples` is ['5', 'example2', 'example3'], `temp_counter` is 6**
