The code initializes an empty list named `moves`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars`). Therefore, the only change is the addition of the `moves` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings with all files, `examples` is a list containing all names of files with type "1", `regulars` is a list containing all names of files with type "0", `moves` is an empty list**
