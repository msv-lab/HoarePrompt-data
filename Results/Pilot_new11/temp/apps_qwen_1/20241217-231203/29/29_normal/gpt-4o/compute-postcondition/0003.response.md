The code splits each file name into a name and a type using the `split()` method. However, since the code snippet does not specify which file is being processed (it uses a placeholder `file`), and no iteration or loop context is given, we assume that the split operation is intended to process the first file in the `files` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of files
- `files` is a list of strings with at least one file
- `examples` is an empty list
- `regulars` is an empty list

Let's assume the first element in the `files` list is "example.txt". The code will split this string into `name` and `type_`.

- `name` will be set to "example"
- `type_` will be set to "txt"

The other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings with at least one file; `examples` is an empty list; `regulars` is an empty list; `name` is "example"; `type_` is "txt".**
