`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`. After incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, these conditions still hold true.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
