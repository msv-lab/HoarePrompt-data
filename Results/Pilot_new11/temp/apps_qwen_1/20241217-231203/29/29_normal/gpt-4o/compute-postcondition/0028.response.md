To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions and the given states step by step.

### Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `examples` must have at least one file.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `temp_counter` is `n + 3`.
   - The current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to the string `str(0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `str(1)`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions inside the `while` loop must hold true:
     - `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
     - `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`.

### Current Values

- Since `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, we need to check if `n + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(n + 3)` is in `files_set`.

#### Check `temp_counter` Condition:

- Given `temp_counter = n + 3` and the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`:
  - This translates to `n + 3 <= 2 * n`.
  - Simplifying this, we get `3 <= n`.
  - We know from the problem statement that `n` must be at least 2, and since `n` must be at least 3 (because `3 <= n`), `n` must be 3 or greater.
  - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is 3 or greater for the loop to continue.

#### Check `str(temp_counter) in files_set` Condition:

- `str(temp_counter)` is `str(n + 3)`.
- We know `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`.
- To satisfy the condition `str(n + 3)` must also be in `files_set`.

### Adjusted States

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the following states:

- Ensure `n` is at least 3.
- Ensure `str(n + 3)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, the adjusted states are:

State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` must be `n + 3` with `n` being at least 3, the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to `str(1)`, and `str(n + 3)` must be in `files_set`**.
