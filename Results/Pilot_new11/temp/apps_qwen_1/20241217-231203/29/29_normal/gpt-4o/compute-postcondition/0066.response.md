`moves` is appended with the string `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. The value of `temp_counter` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are: `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 4`, `i` is 2, and `moves` now includes both the original string and the new string `move {examples[2]} 3`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 4`; `moves` contains the strings 'move {examples[1]} 2' and 'move {examples[2]} 3'**
