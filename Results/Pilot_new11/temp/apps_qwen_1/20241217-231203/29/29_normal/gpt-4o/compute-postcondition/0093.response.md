`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and it is also in `files_set`. The value of `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, which means `examples` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `len(examples)` is 3 (for example). The value of `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, and `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, with `target` being `2 * len(examples) + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` (which was initially less than or equal to `2 * n` and now is one more), `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`.
Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
