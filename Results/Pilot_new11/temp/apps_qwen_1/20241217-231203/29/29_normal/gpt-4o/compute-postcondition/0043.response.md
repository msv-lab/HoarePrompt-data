To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the while loop:

The while loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as two conditions are true:
     1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `temp_counter` has been increased by 1 from the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the Next Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must hold true:
     - `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
     - `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `temp_counter` has already been increased by 1, we need to ensure that:
     - `temp_counter` remains within the range `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
     - `str(temp_counter)` should still be in `files_set`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is within the required bounds and is still present in `files_set`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
