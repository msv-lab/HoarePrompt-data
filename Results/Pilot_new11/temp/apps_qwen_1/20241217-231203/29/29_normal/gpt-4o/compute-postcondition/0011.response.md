`examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name`, which is "example", to the `examples` list. Since `name` is "example", the `examples` list, which was initially empty or included "example", will now include "example". The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`name` is "example", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one), `examples` is a list containing "example", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".**
