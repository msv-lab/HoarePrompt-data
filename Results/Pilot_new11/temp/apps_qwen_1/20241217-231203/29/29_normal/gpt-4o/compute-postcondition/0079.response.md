The code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list, where `temp_counter` is used in the string. However, the code does not change the value of `temp_counter` or any other variables directly mentioned. It only uses `temp_counter` in the string creation. Therefore, the value of `temp_counter` remains unchanged and is still equal to `2 * n + len(files_set)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + len(files_set)`, and `temp_counter` must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations; `moves` now contains a new entry `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`.**
