Let's break down the given conditions and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1`
- `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

### Loop Condition:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1` (which means `temp_counter` could be `2 * n` or less).
   - `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to continue.

3. **For the Loop to Execute One More Time**:
   - To continue the loop, `temp_counter` must satisfy both conditions: 
     - `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     - `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1` and could be `2 * n` or less, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is exactly `2 * n + 1` or less but not already `2 * n + 1` (since it would already have exited the loop).

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1`, to ensure it can still enter the loop, it should be strictly less than `2 * n + 1`. This ensures that if `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, it can still enter the loop.
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

### Updated State:
State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**

So, the final state to ensure the loop can execute one more time is:
State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
