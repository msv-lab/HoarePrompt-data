The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the new value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user within this range.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
