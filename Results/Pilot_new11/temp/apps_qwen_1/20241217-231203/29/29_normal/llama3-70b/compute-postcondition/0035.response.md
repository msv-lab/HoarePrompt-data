According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `script` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `line` is the second element of `script`, and `line` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `script` must have at least three elements, and `line` must be the third element of `script`.

State: **`script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least three elements, `line` is the third element of `script`, and `line` is printed.**
