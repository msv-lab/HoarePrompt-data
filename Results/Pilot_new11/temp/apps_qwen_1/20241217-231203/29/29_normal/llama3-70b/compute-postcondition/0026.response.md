The code appends a new string to the `script` list, specifically `f'move {file} {i}'`. The values of `n`, `file`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `script` now includes the new string.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 2`
- `file` is the `(n + 1)`-th element in `examples`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `script` is appended with `f'move {file} {i}'`

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 2`; `file` is the `(n + 1)`-th element in `examples`; `i` is `n + 1`; `script` includes the value `f'move {file} {i}'`.**
