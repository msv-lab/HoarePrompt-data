The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a formatted string to the `script` list. The formatted string includes the value of `file` and the integer `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `file` is the second element in the `examples` list. The `script` list initially contains the string `'move {file} {i}'`.

After executing the code, the `script` list will have this additional string appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `file` is the second element in `examples`, and `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}'` and `f'move {file} 2'`**
