According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. The loop continues as long as `script` contains more elements. At the end of the last iteration, `script` is a non-empty iterable, `line` is the first element of `script`, and `line` is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, `script` must contain at least two elements, and `line` will be the second element of `script`.

State: **`script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `line` is the second element of `script`, and `line` is printed.**
