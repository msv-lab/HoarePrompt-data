Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over the `examples` list using `enumerate`.
   - `i` is the index starting from 1.
   - `file` is the tuple from the `examples` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
   - `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value.
   - `examples` is a list of strings which are the `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 1.
   - `regular` is a list of `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 0.
   - `script` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `examples` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is something to iterate over.
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the first iteration will use `file` as the first element in `examples`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `examples` must have at least one element to ensure the loop can execute.
   - `i` must start from 1.
   - `file` will be the first element in `examples`.

Based on this analysis, the required adjustments are:

- `examples` must have at least one element.
- `i` must be 1.
- `file` will be the first element in `examples`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop is:

**`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `i` is 1, and `file` is the first element in `examples`.**
