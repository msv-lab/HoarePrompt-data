Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program checks if the sum of each pair of shovels (i and n-i) ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not always accurately determine the maximum number of trailing nines. Specifically, it fails to account for the case where the sum has multiple sets of trailing nines. For example, when `n = 50`, the correct answer should be 1, corresponding to the pair (49, 50), but the program would incorrectly count multiple pairs because it only checks for the highest power of 10 that divides the sum without considering if there are additional sets of trailing nines.
