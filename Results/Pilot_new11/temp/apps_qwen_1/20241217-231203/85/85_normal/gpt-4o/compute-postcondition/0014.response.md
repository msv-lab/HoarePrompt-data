The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since no specific condition or output is provided, we can only state the range of the integer `n`.
