The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_9s`. This does not affect the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` being the integer input provided by the user (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), and `max_9s` being 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9); `max_9s` is 0**
