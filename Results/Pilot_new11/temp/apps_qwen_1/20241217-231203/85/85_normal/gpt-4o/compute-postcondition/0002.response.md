Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- The condition for the `while` loop is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.
- This means that in order for the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be divisible by 10, which implies that `n` must end in the digit 9 (since adding 1 to a number ending in 9 results in a number ending in 0).

### Current State Before Loop:
- `n` is an integer input provided by the user, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `max_9s` is 0.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must end in the digit 9.
- Since `n` is an integer input provided by the user, we cannot guarantee that it ends in 9 just based on the current state.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` ends in 9.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute at least once, `n` needs to be adjusted to end in the digit 9.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be an integer ending in 9, `max_9s` is 0**
