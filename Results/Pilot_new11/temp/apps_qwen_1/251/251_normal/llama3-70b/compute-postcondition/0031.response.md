Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` is the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`, and `dp[2]` is `cakes[2][0]`. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` for some `j` in the range of `i`.**
