The code `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` assigns the value of `cakes[i][0]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the value of `dp[1]` is set to `cakes[1][0]`. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`**
