According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 because each iteration reduces `n` by 1.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we do not know the exact value of `n` after the previous iteration, but it must be positive. After one iteration, `n` will be reduced by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
