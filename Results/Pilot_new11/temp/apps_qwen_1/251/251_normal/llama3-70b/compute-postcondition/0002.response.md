According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `cakes` is an empty list. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list**
