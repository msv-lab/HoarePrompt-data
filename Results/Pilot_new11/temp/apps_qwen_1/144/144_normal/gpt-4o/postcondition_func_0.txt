The function takes no explicit parameters but reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer `n` representing the size of the list, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and calculates the smallest non-negative integer (mex) that is not present in the list. The function outputs this value `mex`. The final state of the program includes the variable `mex` being the smallest integer not present in the sorted list `a`. Potential edge cases include when the list `a` contains only one element, or when the list `a` already contains all integers from 1 to `n`. The function also handles the case where the input list `a` is empty, although this case is not explicitly covered in the provided annotations.
