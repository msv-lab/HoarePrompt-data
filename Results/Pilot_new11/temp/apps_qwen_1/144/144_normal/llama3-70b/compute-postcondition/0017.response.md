According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` from the list `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element.
- `mex` is either 1 or 2.

In the loop, if `num` (the next element in `arr`) equals `mex`, then `mex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. The list `arr` must still contain at least one element.
2. The value of `mex` could either be 1 or 2.

If the current `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` will be set to 2. Otherwise, `mex` will remain the same.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the list `arr` must still have at least one element, and `mex` must still be either 1 or 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, `mex` is either 1 or 2.**
