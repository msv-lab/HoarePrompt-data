The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` is now an integer representing the number of elements in the array. The other part of the initial state, which includes the input of the array elements, is not yet processed.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), the array elements are not yet read.**
