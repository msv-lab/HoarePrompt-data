The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `mex`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`, but initializes `mex` to 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mex` and retains the initial values of `n` and `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000); `arr` is a sorted list of integers from the second line of standard input; `mex` is 1**
