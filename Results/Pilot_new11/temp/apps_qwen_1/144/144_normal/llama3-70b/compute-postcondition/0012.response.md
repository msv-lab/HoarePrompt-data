According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements left in the list `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element.
- `mex` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `num` equals `mex` or not. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` becomes 2; otherwise, `mex` remains 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `arr` must still contain at least one element.
- `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
- Depending on whether `num` equals `mex` or not, `mex` will be updated accordingly.

Since the list `arr` is non-empty, removing one element still leaves it as non-empty. Therefore, the condition for continuing the loop is that `arr` should not be empty yet.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, `mex` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `num` (next element in `arr`) equals `mex` or not. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` becomes 2; otherwise, `mex` remains 1.**
