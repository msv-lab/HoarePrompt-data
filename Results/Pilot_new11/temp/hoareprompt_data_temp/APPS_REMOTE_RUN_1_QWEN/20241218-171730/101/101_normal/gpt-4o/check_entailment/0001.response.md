Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the smallest possible frame in all cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the smallest possible frame does not exist, which should return `-1`, but instead, it incorrectly returns a partial frame or does not handle the case properly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```

The expected output should be `-1` because there is no valid 1-pixel wide frame that can enclose all white pixels without extending beyond the bounds. However, the current implementation will attempt to draw a frame, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you need to ensure that after identifying the bounding box of the white pixels, you check if the height and width are both at least 2 before attempting to draw the frame. If not, return `-1`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result
```

With this correction, the program should now correctly identify and return `-1` for cases where a valid 1-pixel wide frame does not exist.
