The code snippet `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to `'+'`. According to the initial state, if `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`, then `result[i][j]` is set to `'+'` only if it does not already equal `'.'`. Otherwise, no change is made.

Since the code directly sets `result[i][j]` to `'+'`, this condition is met regardless of the original value of `result[i][j]` (whether it was `'.'` or any other character), as long as `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`.

Thus, the value of `result[i][j]` is updated to `'+'` if it meets the conditions mentioned. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, but since the output state is focused on the values of the variables, we will update `result[i][j]` and keep other variables as they are in the initial state.

Output State: **`result[i][j]` is `'+'`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
