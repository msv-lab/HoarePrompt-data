The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to '+' when `i` is either `top` or `bottom` and `j` is either `left` or `right`. This means the corners of the frame are updated to '+'.

Let's break down the changes:

- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- `frame_height` remains unchanged because the number of rows hasn't changed.
- `frame_width` remains unchanged because the number of columns hasn't changed.
- `result` is updated such that `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` are set to '+'.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` updated to '+' when `result[i][j]` equals '.' for the current row index `i` being either `top` or `bottom`, and the current column index `j` being either `left` or `right`; `j` is incremented by 1, and `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` are now '+'**.
