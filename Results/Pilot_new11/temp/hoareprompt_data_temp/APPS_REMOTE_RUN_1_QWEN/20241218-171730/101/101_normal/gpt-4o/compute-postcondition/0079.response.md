The code `right = j` updates the value of `right` to be the same as `j`. Given the initial conditions, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, and other variables like `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` are adjusted based on certain conditions.

- Initially, `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`.
- Since `right` is being reassigned to `j` now, it means that `right` is set to `j`.

Therefore, the new value of `right` is `j + 1` (from the previous condition) but is now overwritten to `j`.

The states of `top`, `bottom`, and `left` remain unchanged. `i` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, `right` is now `j`, and `left` remains unchanged.**
