The code updates `max_x` and `max_y` to ensure they are the maximum values between their current values and the coordinates `x` and `y` of the last 'w' pixel added to `white_pixels`. Since `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are already defined and initialized to the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel. The code does not provide specific values for `x` and `y`, but it ensures that `max_x` and `max_y` will be updated to the maximum values found among all `x` and `y` coordinates of the 'w' pixels in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum values between their current values and the `x` and `y` coordinates of the last 'w' pixel added to `white_pixels`.**
