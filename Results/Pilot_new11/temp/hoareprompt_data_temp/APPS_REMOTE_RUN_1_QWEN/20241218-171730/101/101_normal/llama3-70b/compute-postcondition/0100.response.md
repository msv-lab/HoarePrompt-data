Functionality: **The function processes a grid of pixels represented as a list of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters ('.' for black pixels and 'w' for white pixels). It calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the size of this bounding box can fit within the original dimensions of the grid. If the bounding box cannot fit, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it modifies the grid by converting the border of the bounding box into '+' characters while keeping the white pixels as 'w' and all other pixels as '.'. Finally, it prints the modified grid row by row.**

This function handles the following scenarios:
- It correctly identifies the bounding box of the white pixels.
- It ensures the bounding box fits within the grid dimensions, returning `-1` if it doesn't.
- It properly modifies the grid to place '+' characters on the border of the bounding box and keeps all other pixels unchanged.
- It includes an edge case where the grid might have only one white pixel, which would still form a valid bounding box.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where the grid dimensions are equal to the bounding box dimensions, which would result in a valid output without any changes.
