Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment was marked as **False** because the provided program does not correctly identify the smallest possible frame in all cases, specifically failing to return `-1` when no valid 1-pixel wide frame exists. After reviewing the code and the output hints, the revised function `func_1` now correctly checks if the frame height and width are both at least 2 before attempting to draw the frame. If not, it returns `-1`.

Hereâ€™s the revised function again for clarity:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result
```

This revised function now ensures that the program correctly handles cases where no valid 1-pixel wide frame exists by returning `-1` as expected. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate, and the program is now correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
