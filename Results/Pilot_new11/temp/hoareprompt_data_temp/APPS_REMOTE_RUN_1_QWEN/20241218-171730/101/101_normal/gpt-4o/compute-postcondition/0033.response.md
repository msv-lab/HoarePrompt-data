Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". After executing the if-else block:
- If `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j`.
- Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is updated to `j`, and `right` is updated to `j`. If `j > right`, the `right` boundary is also updated to `j`.***
