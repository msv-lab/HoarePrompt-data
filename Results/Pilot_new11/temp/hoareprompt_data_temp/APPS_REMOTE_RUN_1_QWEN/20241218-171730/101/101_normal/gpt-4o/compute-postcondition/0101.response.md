The code sets `top` and `bottom` both to the value of `i`. The previous values of `top` and `bottom` were `None` and the value of `i`, respectively. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `top` and `bottom` are now both `n + 1`. The other variables (`j`, `left`, `right`, `m`, and `screen`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
