The code assigns the value `'.'` to `pixels[i][j]`. Given that `i` is less than `n` and `j` is 2, the specific value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 2, and `pixels[i][2]` is `'.'`**
