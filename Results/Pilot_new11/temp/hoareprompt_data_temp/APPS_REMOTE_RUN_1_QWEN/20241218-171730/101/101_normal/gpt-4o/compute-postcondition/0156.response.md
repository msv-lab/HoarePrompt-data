To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the condition under which the loop runs and the initial state provided.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if there is at least one value of `j` within the range specified by `left` and `right + 1`.

2. **Initial State Provided**:
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
   - `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
   - `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen`.
   - `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one column index `j` such that `left <= j <= right`. This means `left` should be less than or equal to `right`.

4. **Additional States to Adjust**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over columns from `left` to `right`, both `left` and `right` must be valid indices and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen`; `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`; `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.**
