To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can run based on the given program state and postconditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
   - `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple.
   - `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
   - `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
   - `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
   - `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
   - `frame_size` is defined as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
   - The frame size is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute `n` times.
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop will iterate over the `pixels` list, which means `n` should be valid and non-negative.

4. **Modifying the Initial State**:
   - Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial state already includes `n` as an integer input, so no additional adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **Considering `pixels` List**:
   - The `pixels` list must exist and contain at least one row (since `n` must be at least 1).

6. **Considering `white_pixels` List**:
   - The `white_pixels` list must contain at least one tuple to ensure the loop can proceed and process at least one white pixel.

7. **Other Variables**:
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are derived from the `white_pixels` list, so their presence is guaranteed if the `white_pixels` list contains at least one tuple.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the key adjustments required are ensuring `n` is greater than 0 and the `white_pixels` list contains at least one tuple.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple**
