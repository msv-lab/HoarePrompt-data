The code initializes four variables: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. These variables are set to infinity (`float('inf')`) and negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), respectively. This is done to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid.

Since no operations are performed on `n`, `pixels`, or `white_pixels`, their values remain unchanged. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are now initialized.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.**
