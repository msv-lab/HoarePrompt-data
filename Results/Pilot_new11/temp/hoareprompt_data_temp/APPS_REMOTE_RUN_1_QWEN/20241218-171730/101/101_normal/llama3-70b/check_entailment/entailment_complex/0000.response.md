Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program reads the dimensions of the monitor (`n` and `m`) and the state of the pixels.
   - It correctly identifies all white pixels and their coordinates, storing them in `white_pixels`.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the bounding box of the white pixels by determining the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates.
   - The size of the bounding box is computed as `frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

3. **Validation and Output**:
   - The program checks if the bounding box can fit within the dimensions of the monitor (`frame_size <= max(n, m)`).
   - If the bounding box cannot fit, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it modifies the grid to mark the border of the bounding box with `+` characters while keeping the white pixels as `w` and all other pixels as `.`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the bounding box cannot fit within the grid dimensions by printing `-1`.
   - It ensures that the frame is as small as possible by checking the minimum dimensions needed to enclose all white pixels.

Given the assumptions that the input is valid and will not cause errors (e.g., non-list inputs, invalid characters), the program correctly implements the logic to find and display the smallest possible frame around the white pixels. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
