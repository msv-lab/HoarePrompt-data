According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- For all `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` will be `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise.
- If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `i + 1`. Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the updated state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, for all `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` will be `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.**
