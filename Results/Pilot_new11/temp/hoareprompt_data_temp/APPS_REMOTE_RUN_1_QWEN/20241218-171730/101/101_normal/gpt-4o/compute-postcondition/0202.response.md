Output State: **`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, and `result` remain the same. All elements in `result` are either `+` or `.`. If an element `result[i][j]` is `+`, then it was initially `.` and `i` was `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` during some iteration of the loop, and `j` was within the range `[left, right]`. If `result[i][j]` is `.`, it remains unchanged throughout the loop.**
