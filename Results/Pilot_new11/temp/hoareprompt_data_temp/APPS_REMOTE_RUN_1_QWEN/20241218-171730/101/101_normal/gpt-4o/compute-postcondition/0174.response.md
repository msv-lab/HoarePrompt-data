Postcondition: **`j` is `left`, `i` is `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'; `(i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right))`, and the current value of `result[i][j]` is '.', meaning that the cell at position `(i, j)` in `result` was originally a '.'.**
