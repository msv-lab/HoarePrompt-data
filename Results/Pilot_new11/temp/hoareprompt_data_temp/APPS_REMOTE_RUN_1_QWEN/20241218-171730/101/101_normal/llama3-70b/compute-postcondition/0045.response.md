The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` changes the value of the pixel at position `(i, j)` from `'.'` to `'+')`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, the current value of `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, additionally, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is now equal to `'+')`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, the current value of `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is `'+')**.
