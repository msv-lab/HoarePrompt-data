According to the given for loop, the loop variable `j` will increment by 1 at each iteration. The loop condition depends on the variable `j` and `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 (since it starts at 0), and `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `j` must be incremented from 0 to 1.
- `m` must remain greater than or equal to 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**.
