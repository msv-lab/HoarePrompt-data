The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and the list `screen` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w"; if `i > bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` is set to `i`; `bottom` is now equal to `i`; `left` is equal to `j`.
