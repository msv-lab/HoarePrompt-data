According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. The loop body updates the states based on the condition that if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j > right`; otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
- `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`.
- If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j > right`; otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must be within the bounds of the list `screen[0:m]`.

Let's denote the new value of `j` as `j_new = j + 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `j < m`, for the loop to continue executing, `j_new` must still be less than `m`.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to `j + 1`.
- `right` should be checked against `j + 1` to see if it needs to be updated.

To summarize, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`; otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged.**

In a simplified format:

State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, and `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`.**
