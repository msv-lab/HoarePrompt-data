The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `+`. The index `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is a valid index for the list `pixels`. The value of `j` is given as 1. The other variables `n`, `white_pixels`, `m`, and the specific value of `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `pixels[i][j]` is `+`**
