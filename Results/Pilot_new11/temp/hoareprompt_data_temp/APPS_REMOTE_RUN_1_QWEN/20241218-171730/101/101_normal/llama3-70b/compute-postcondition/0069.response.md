The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the pixel value at the coordinates `(i, j)` from `'.'` to `'+'.` Given the initial conditions, the values of `i`, `j`, and `pixels` are updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` must be 0, and either `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and the pixel value `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'+'.**
