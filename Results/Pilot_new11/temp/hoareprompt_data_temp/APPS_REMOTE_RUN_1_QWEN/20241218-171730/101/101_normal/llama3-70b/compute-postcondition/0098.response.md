Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'). `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple. `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, then `-1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, for each `(i, j)` in `pixels`, if `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`.***
