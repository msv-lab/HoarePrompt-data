The value of `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'; `top` remains unchanged and equals `i`; `bottom` equals `i`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'; `top` remains unchanged and equals `i`; `bottom` equals `i`**
