Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'; if `i` is `top` or `bottom` and `j` is `left` or `right`, `result[i][j]` is '+'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column from `left` to `right` inclusive.
- For each iteration, it checks if the current position `(i, j)` is on the boundary (`i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right`).
- If the position is on the boundary and the cell contains a '.', it updates the cell to '+'.
- After all iterations, every boundary cell (top, bottom, left, and right) will be marked with '+' if they were originally '.', while other cells remain unchanged.

Since the loop ensures that all boundary cells are updated, regardless of how many times it executes, the final state of the `result` list will have all the boundary cells updated as specified.
