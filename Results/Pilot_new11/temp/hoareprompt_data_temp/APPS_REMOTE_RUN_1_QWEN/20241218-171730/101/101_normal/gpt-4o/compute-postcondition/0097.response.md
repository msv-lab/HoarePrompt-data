According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to a value less than `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `m`
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`

To satisfy the loop condition `i < n`, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.

The other variables (`j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop condition or the increment of `i`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `m`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`**
