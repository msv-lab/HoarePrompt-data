The code sets both `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `top` and `bottom` will both be `n + 1`.

The other variables (`j`, `m`, `left`, and `right`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
