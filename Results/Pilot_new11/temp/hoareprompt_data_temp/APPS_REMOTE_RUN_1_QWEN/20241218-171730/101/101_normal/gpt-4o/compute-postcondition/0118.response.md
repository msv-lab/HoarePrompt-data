According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and its range defined by `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 0

The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[0, m - 1]`. Since `j` was within this range in the previous iteration, it means `j` must have been incremented by 1 (from its previous value) and is now at the maximum value of the range.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `j` must be incremented from its previous value to the next value within the range `[0, m - 1]`. Since `j` was the maximum value (`m - 1`), the next value would be `0` if we wrap around, but since `j` must remain within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `j` should be set to `0` to start the loop again.
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will be reinitialized based on the condition given in the problem statement.

Given these considerations, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**.
