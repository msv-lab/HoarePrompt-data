The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables, but it does affect the flow of the loop. Given the initial conditions and the fact that `continue` is used, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1` and will be set to `m-1` for the next iteration**
