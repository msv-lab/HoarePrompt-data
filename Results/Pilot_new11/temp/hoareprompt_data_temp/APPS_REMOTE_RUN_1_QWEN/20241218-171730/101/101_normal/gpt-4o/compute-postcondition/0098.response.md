Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, which ranges from `0` to `m - 1`.

2. **Determine Initial Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `j` should be within the range `[0, m - 1]`.
   - Given that `j` is initially set to `m`, it means `j` is already outside the valid range of the loop.

3. **Adjust the Initial States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the initial value of `j` to be within the range `[0, m - 1]`.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that `m` is a positive integer, as `j` would otherwise always be out of bounds if `m` is zero or negative.

### Conclusion:
To allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the initial state such that `j` is within the valid range `[0, m - 1]` and `m` is a positive integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `m` must be greater than 0**
