You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Output hints: The function processes a grid of pixels represented as a list of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters ('.' for black pixels and 'w' for white pixels). It calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the size of this bounding box can fit within the original dimensions of the grid. If the bounding box cannot fit, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it modifies the grid by converting the border of the bounding box into '+' characters while keeping the white pixels as 'w' and all other pixels as '.'. Finally, it prints the modified grid row by row.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
