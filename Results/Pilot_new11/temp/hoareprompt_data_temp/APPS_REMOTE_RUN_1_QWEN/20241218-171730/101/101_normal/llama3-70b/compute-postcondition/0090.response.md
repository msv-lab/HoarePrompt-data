Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is the length of each list in `pixels`, for all `(i, j)` in `pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over every element in the `pixels` grid.
- If the element is at the boundary defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, or `max_y` and its value is `'.'`, it is changed to `'+'`.
- If the element is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
- If the element is `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if it is at the boundary and remains `'.'` otherwise.

Since the loop continues to iterate until all elements in the `pixels` grid are checked, the final state of the grid will reflect these conditions. If the loop does not execute (which would happen if there are no white pixels), the initial state of `pixels` remains unchanged, except for the values that were originally `'.'` and became `'w'` due to the boundaries.
