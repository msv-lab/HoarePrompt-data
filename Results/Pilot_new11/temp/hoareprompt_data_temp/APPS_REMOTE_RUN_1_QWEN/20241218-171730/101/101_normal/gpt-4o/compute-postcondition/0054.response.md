`left` is assigned the value `j`, and `right` is also assigned the value `j`. The values of the other variables (`screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.
