The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and the coordinates `x` and `y` from the `white_pixels` list. Since `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of a 'w' character, `min_x` and `min_y` will be updated to the smallest `x` and `y` values found in `white_pixels`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the minimum of its original value (`float('inf')`) and the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum of its original value (`float('inf')`) and the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.
