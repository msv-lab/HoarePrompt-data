Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` consisting of characters "." and "w", where "w" represents a white pixel and "." represents a black pixel. At least one pixel in the screen is white.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It finds the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost indices of any 'w' in the `screen`.
2. If no white pixels are found (`top` or `bottom` or `left` or `right` remains `None`), it returns -1.
3. It calculates the frame height and width based on the found indices.
4. If the frame height or width is less than 2, it returns -1.
5. It creates a copy of the original `screen` called `result`.
6. It updates the border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) in `result` to '+' if they were originally '.'.

The function can return one of three states:
- Case_1: The function returns -1 if no white pixels are found or if the frame dimensions are less than 2.
- Case_2: The function returns -1 under the same conditions as Case_1.
- Case_3: The function returns a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be:
- If the function returns -1, the program will have returned -1.
- If the function returns a modified `result`, the `result` will be a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.**
