The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but rather affects the flow of the loop. Since no variables are updated by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1**
