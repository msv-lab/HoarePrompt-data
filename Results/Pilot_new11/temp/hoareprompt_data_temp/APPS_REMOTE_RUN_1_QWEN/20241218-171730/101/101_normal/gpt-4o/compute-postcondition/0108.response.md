The code sets `bottom` to the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, so `bottom` is now also `n + 1`. The other variables (`j`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `m`, and the value of `screen[i][j]`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
