The code sets `top` to the current value of `i`. Since `i` represents the row index in the `screen` list, and given the initial conditions, the value of `top` will be updated to the current row index `i`.

- `top` is set to `i`.
- The values of `screen`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j+1` if `j+1 > left`, otherwise it remains `None`. `right` is `j+1` if `j+1 > right`, otherwise it remains `None`.**
