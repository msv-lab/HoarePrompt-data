The code sets `left` and `right` both to the value of `j`. The value of `j` is within the range `[0, m - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
