The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, compute the product of `a` and `b`, divide this product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and return the integer division result.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.**
