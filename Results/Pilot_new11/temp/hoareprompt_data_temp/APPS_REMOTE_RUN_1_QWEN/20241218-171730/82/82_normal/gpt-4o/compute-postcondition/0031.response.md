Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `a` and `b` are the smallest multiples of `diff // min_k` that are greater than or equal to their original values, `diff` remains the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`. Since there is no else part, if the condition `diff % k != 0` holds, the variables retain their states as per the precondition.***
