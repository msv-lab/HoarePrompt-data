Postcondition: ***`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum of `min_lcm` and `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the smallest candidate that achieves the minimum `min_lcm`, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`***
