To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

### Given States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers.
- \(diff\) remains the same.
- \(\text{min\_lcm}\) is the minimum value between the previous \(\text{min\_lcm}\) and the value returned by \(\text{func\_2(new\_a, new\_b)}\).
- \(\text{min\_k}\) is the corresponding candidate that achieved this minimum LCM.
- \(k\) is incremented.
- If \(diff \% k == 0\), then:
  - \(\text{new\_a}\) is the largest multiple of \(\text{min\_k}\) that is less than or equal to \(a + \text{min\_k} - 1\).
  - \(\text{new\_b}\) is the largest multiple of \(\text{min\_k}\) that is less than or equal to \(b + \text{min\_k} - 1\).
- Otherwise, the values of \(\text{new\_a}\) and \(\text{new\_b}\) remain unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for \(k\) in the range from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Increment of \(k\)**: Since \(k\) is incremented at each iteration, the new value of \(k\) will be the current value of \(k\) plus 1.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as \(k \leq \lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\). 

Given that \(k\) is incremented by 1, the new value of \(k\) should still satisfy the condition \(k \leq \lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\).

### Updated States:
- \(a\) and \(b\) remain the same since they are not modified within the loop.
- \(diff\) remains the same.
- \(\text{min\_lcm}\) remains the same since it is determined only once per run of the function (assuming \(\text{func\_2}\) does not modify it).
- \(\text{min\_k}\) remains the same for the same reason as \(\text{min\_lcm}\).
- \(k\) is incremented by 1.

Since \(k\) is incremented and the loop condition \(k \leq \lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\) must still hold true for the loop to continue:

### New State:
- \(a\) is the same.
- \(b\) is the same.
- \(diff\) is the same.
- \(\text{min\_lcm}\) is the same.
- \(\text{min\_k}\) is the same.
- \(k\) is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as \(k \leq \lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is incremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to \(\lfloor \sqrt{\text{diff}} \rfloor + 1\)**.
