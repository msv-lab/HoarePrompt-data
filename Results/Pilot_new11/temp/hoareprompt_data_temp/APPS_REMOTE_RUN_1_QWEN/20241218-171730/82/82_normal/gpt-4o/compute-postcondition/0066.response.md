Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `candidate` in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
   - The initial value of `k` is 2.
   - The loop will execute for each candidate in the list until there are no more candidates.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `diff` remains the same.
   - `min_lcm` is updated to the minimum of `min_lcm` and `current_lcm`.
   - `min_k` is the smallest candidate that achieves the minimum `min_lcm`.
   - `k` starts as 2.
   - `new_a` is calculated based on `a` and the current candidate.
   - `new_b` is calculated based on `b` and the current candidate.
   - `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

3. **Check the Candidates:**
   - The first candidate is `k`, which is 2.
   - The second candidate is `diff // k`, which is `diff // 2`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over these two candidates: `[2, diff // 2]`.
   - After the first iteration, `k` becomes `diff // 2`.
   - If `diff // 2` is greater than 2, the loop will continue with the next candidate.

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be set to the next candidate in the list.
   - The next candidate is `diff // 2`.
   - Since `diff // 2` is less than or equal to 2 (as `diff` is a positive integer), the next candidate is 2.
   - However, since we already used 2 as the first candidate, the loop will stop if `diff // 2` is not greater than 2.

Given this analysis, the next candidate is `diff // 2`. If `diff // 2` is greater than 2, the loop will continue.

Since `k` will be set to `diff // 2` for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

**State:**
- `a` is the same.
- `b` is the same.
- `diff` is the same.
- `min_lcm` is the same.
- `min_k` is the same.
- `k` is now `diff // 2`.
- `new_a` is recalculated based on `a` and the new `k`.
- `new_b` is recalculated based on `b` and the new `k`.
- `current_lcm` is recalculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`.

However, since we need to provide a simplified state for the next iteration, we can focus on the key variables:

State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is `diff // 2`**
