`new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This operation ensures that `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `candidate` is now `k`, and `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `candidate` is now `k`, and `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`**.
