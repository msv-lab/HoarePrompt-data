Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. 

- The program uses `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- It uses `func_2` to calculate the LCM using the GCD.
- In `func_3`, it iterates over potential values of \( k \) from 1 to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). For each \( k \), it checks if \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) can be adjusted to multiples of \( k \) or \( \frac{diff}{k} \) respectively, ensuring the LCM is minimized.
- It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \).

The program handles all given examples correctly:
- For \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \), the output is \( 2 \), because \( \text{lcm}(6+2, 10+2) = \text{lcm}(8, 12) = 24 \).
- For \( a = 21 \) and \( b = 31 \), the output is \( 9 \), because \( \text{lcm}(21+9, 31+9) = \text{lcm}(30, 40) = 120 \).
- For \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 10 \), the output is \( 0 \), because \( \text{lcm}(5+0, 10+0) = \text{lcm}(5, 10) = 10 \).

Since the program handles the given examples and the logic appears sound, it is correct for the described problem.
