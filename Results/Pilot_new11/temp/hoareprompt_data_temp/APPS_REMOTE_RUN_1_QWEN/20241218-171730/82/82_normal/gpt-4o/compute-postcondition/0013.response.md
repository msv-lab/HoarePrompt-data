The code updates `min_lcm` to the value of `current_lcm`. According to the precondition, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)` and it satisfies one of the following conditions: it is less than `min_lcm` or (it is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`). The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is 0, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
