Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // min_k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // min_k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`.
- For each iteration, it updates `a` and `b` to the smallest multiples of the current candidate that are greater than or equal to their respective original values.
- It calculates `new_a` and `new_b` based on the current candidate.
- It computes the least common multiple (`lcm`) using `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- If the computed `lcm` is smaller than the current `min_lcm` or equal but with a smaller `candidate`, it updates `min_lcm` and `min_k`.

After all iterations, the loop will have considered both possible candidates (`k` and `diff // k`) and updated `a`, `b`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` to reflect the smallest multiple of `diff // min_k` that achieves the minimum `lcm`. If the loop does not execute (e.g., due to the initial conditions), the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain their initial values.
