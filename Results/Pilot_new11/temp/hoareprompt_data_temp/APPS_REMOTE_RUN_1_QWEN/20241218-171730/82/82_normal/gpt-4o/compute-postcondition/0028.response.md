The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `new_a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `current_lcm`, or `new_b`. Therefore, the only change is that `min_k` is now equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is now `current_lcm`, `min_k` is now `candidate`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is `lcm_value`.**
