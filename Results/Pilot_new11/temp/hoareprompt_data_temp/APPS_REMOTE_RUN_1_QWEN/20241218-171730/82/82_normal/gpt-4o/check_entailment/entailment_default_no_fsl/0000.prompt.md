You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

This process handles the case where `y` might initially be 0, in which case the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop. Additionally, the function correctly handles the scenario where both `x` and `y` are positive integers greater than 0, as it repeatedly reduces the problem size until `y` becomes 0. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then divides the result by the output of `func_1(x, y)` using integer division. The function returns the final result. Potential edge cases include when `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error. However, no handling for this specific case is present in the given code, so it is up to the caller to ensure `func_1(x, y)` does not return 0.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It determines the minimum value of `k` that can be used to adjust `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` such that their least common multiple (LCM) is minimized. If `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of `k` up to the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. For each `k`, it calculates the adjusted values of `a` and `b` and finds their LCM. The function keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`. If no valid `k` is found that reduces the LCM, the function returns 0.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
