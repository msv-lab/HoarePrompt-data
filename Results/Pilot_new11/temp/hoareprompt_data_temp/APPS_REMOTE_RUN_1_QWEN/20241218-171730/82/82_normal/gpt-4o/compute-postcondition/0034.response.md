The given code snippet is an assignment statement that calculates the value of `new_a`. However, the initial values of `a` and `candidate` are not provided. We can represent the calculation in a general form.

The line of code:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```
This expression first calculates `a + candidate - 1`, then performs integer division by `candidate`, and finally multiplies the result by `candidate`.

Since the initial values of `a` and `candidate` are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `new_a`. But we can describe the calculation process:

- `a + candidate - 1`: This is the sum of `a` and `candidate` minus 1.
- `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate`: This is the integer division of the above sum by `candidate`.
- The final multiplication by `candidate` rounds down the quotient to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Therefore, the new value of `new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.

Output State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`. The value of `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.**
