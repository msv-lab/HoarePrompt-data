The code sets `min_lcm` to the value of `current_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is defined as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated as \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). Since `candidate` is not defined in the initial state, it remains undefined, but the expression for `new_a` and `new_b` is known.

After executing the line `min_lcm = current_lcm`, the value of `min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`, which is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `min_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_k` is `min_k`, `k` is `k`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)**
