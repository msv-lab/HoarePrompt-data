Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Objective**: The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer \(k\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a + k\) and \(b + k\) is minimized. The code uses a loop to iterate through possible values of \(k\) starting from 0, and for each \(k\), it calculates the LCM of \(a + k\) and \(b + k\). It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and updates \(k\) accordingly. This approach ensures that the smallest \(k\) that minimizes the LCM is found.

3. **Largest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is used to compute the LCM in `func_2` as \(\text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)}\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **When \(a = b\)**: In this case, \(k = 0\) will minimize the LCM, and the code correctly finds \(k = 0\).
   - **When \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of each other**: The GCD calculation and subsequent LCM calculation correctly handle these cases.
   - **When \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime**: The LCM calculation will be \(a \cdot b\), and the code correctly identifies the smallest \(k\).

5. **Annotations**: The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the functions and match the implementation in the code. The code and annotations handle all the described scenarios without any contradictions.

Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and there are no identified edge cases that the code does not handle correctly, the code is correct.
