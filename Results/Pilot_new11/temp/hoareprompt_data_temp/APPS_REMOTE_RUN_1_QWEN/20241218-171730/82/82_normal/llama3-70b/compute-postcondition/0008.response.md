The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` as `a`, and `b` is returned as 0. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, compute their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, and return the GCD as the new value of `a` and 0 as the new value of `b`.
