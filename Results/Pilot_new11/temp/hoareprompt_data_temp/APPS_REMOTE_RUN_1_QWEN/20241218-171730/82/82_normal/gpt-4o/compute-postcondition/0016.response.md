Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- \( \text{a} \) is the smallest multiple of \( \text{candidate} \) that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- \( \text{b} \) is the smallest multiple of \( \text{candidate} \) that is greater than or equal to its original value.
- \( \text{diff} \) is a positive integer.
- \( \text{min_lcm} \) is the minimum value between the previous \( \text{min_lcm} \) and the value returned by \( \text{func_2(new\_a, new\_b)} \).
- \( \text{min_k} \) is the corresponding \( \text{candidate} \) when \( \text{min_lcm} \) is achieved.

### Loop Condition
The for loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `candidate`.
2. **Determine the Next Value of `candidate`**: Since the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`, the next value of `candidate` could either be `k` or `diff // k`, depending on which one was used in the previous iteration.

3. **Update the States**:
   - \( \text{a} \) and \( \text{b} \) will remain the same as they are determined based on the current `candidate` and not updated within the loop body.
   - \( \text{diff} \) remains unchanged.
   - \( \text{min_lcm} \) and \( \text{min_k} \) will be updated if the new value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is smaller than the current `min_lcm`.

### Adjusting the States
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set the `candidate` to the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]` that has not yet been used.

Since the previous `candidate` was either `k` or `diff // k`, the next value should be the other one.

### Final State
- If the previous `candidate` was `k`, the next `candidate` should be `diff // k`.
- If the previous `candidate` was `diff // k`, the next `candidate` should be `k`.

Given this, we need to ensure the following:
- The `candidate` is set to the remaining value in the list.
- All other states remain the same.

### Example Answer
Assuming the previous `candidate` was `k`, the next `candidate` would be `diff // k`.

State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, and `candidate` is now `diff // k`.**

If the previous `candidate` was `diff // k`, then:

State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, and `candidate` is now `k`.**

In summary, the state adjustments depend on which value (`k` or `diff // k`) was used previously, but the essential states remain the same, only the `candidate` changes to the remaining value in the list.
