The code calculates `new_b` based on `b`, `candidate`, and performs a floor division followed by multiplication. Specifically, `new_b` is set to the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.
- `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.

The code impacts only `new_b`:
- `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

Since `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` results in the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, this new value is assigned to `new_b`.

Output State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.**
