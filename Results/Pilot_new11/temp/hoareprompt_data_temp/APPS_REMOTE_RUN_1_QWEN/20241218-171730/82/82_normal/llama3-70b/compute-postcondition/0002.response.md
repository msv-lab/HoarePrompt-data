Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\)) and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. This means the function computes `(a * b) // func_1(a, b)` and ensures that the result is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled separately, but the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-negative value. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a negative value, the behavior of the integer division operation is defined by Python, which will treat the negative value as a non-zero divisor.**

This summary captures the essential functionality of the function, including potential issues like division by zero, without delving into implementation details.
