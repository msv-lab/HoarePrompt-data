Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.
- `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.
- `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.
- `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`).

### For Loop:
```
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable:**
   - The loop variable is `candidate`, and it iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `candidate`:**
   - If the loop has already executed once, then the current value of `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k` (whichever was used in the previous iteration).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `candidate`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over two possible values `[k, diff // k]`, the next value of `candidate` will be the other value in the list.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.
   - `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated based on the new value of `candidate`.
   - `current_lcm` will be reassigned to the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` using the new `candidate`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if the conditions are met (either `current_lcm < min_lcm` or `current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k`).

Given the above analysis, let's assume the loop has executed with `candidate = k` in the previous iteration. Therefore, the next value of `candidate` will be `diff // k`.

### New State:
- `new_a` will be recalculated as the largest multiple of `diff // k` that is less than or equal to `a + (diff // k) - 1`.
- `new_b` will be recalculated as the largest multiple of `diff // k` that is less than or equal to `b + (diff // k) - 1`.
- `current_lcm` will be assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` using `diff // k`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if the conditions are met with `diff // k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `diff // k` that is less than or equal to `a + (diff // k) - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `diff // k` that is less than or equal to `b + (diff // k) - 1`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `diff // k` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `diff // k < min_k`).**
