The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\), and \(b\) is the ceiling of \(n\) divided by \(a\). The function iterates through all possible values of \(a\) in the specified range, computes \(b\) for each \(a\), and calculates the corresponding \(2 + 2a + 2b\). It keeps track of the minimum value found during this process. If `n` is exactly a perfect square, the function will consider both the integer and the next integer for \(a\) to ensure the minimum value is correctly identified. The function returns the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\), which corresponds to the optimal values of \(a\) and \(b\) that achieve this minimum.
