`segments_needed` is assigned the value `2 * (a + b)`. Given the initial state where `a` is 1 and `b` is `n`, we can substitute these values into the expression. Therefore, `segments_needed` is calculated as `2 * (1 + n)`, which simplifies to `2 + 2 * n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `min_segments_needed` is infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is `n`, `segments_needed` is `2 + 2 * n`**
