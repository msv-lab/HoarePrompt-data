Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. It calculates and prints the value `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. This value represents the length of the binary representation of `n` minus one, doubled, plus two. There are no explicit return statements, so the function does not return any value. The function does not handle any input validation beyond converting the input to an integer, meaning it assumes the input is always within the specified range. If the input is outside the range, the behavior is undefined.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the binary length is 1, and the calculation results in `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2`.
- If `n` is at the upper limit of 10^9, the binary length is 30, and the calculation results in `2 * (30 - 1) + 2 = 60`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate if the input is indeed within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If the input is outside this range, the function will still proceed with the calculation, which may lead to unexpected results or errors if the input handling is not robust elsewhere in the program.
