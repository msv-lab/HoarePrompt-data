Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy involves drawing the minimum number of initial segments with a ruler, which should be either the number of columns or rows needed to cover all squares. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

For example, consider \( n = 4 \):

- If Sofia needs to draw 4 squares, the most efficient way is to draw 2 vertical and 2 horizontal segments initially, totaling 4 segments. This is because the optimal solution would involve drawing 2 vertical and 2 horizontal segments, which are used to guide the drawing of the remaining segments.

However, the current program calculates something different:

```python
n = 4
print(func_1(n))
```

This would output `4`, which is incorrect because the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is actually `4` (2 vertical and 2 horizontal).

The correct approach should directly calculate the number of initial vertical and horizontal segments required to cover all squares. The optimal solution is simply \( 2 \times \max(\text{number of rows}, \text{number of columns}) \).

A corrected version of the function could look like this:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

def func_1(n):
    side_length = int(math.sqrt(n))
    if side_length * side_length == n:
        return 2 * side_length
    else:
        return 2 * (side_length + 1)

result = func_1(n)
print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of segments drawn with a ruler is minimized by considering the dimensions of the grid needed to accommodate all squares.
