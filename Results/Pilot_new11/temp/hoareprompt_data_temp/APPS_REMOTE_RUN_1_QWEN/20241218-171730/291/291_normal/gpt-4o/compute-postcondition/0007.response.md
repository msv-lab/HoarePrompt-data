The code `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)` updates the value of `segments_needed`. Initially, `segments_needed` is equal to `2 + 2 * n`. Given `a = 2` and `b = (n + 1) / 2`, the new value of `segments_needed` is calculated as follows:

1. Substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the expression: `segments_needed = 2 * (2 + (n + 1) / 2)`
2. Simplify the expression: `segments_needed = 2 * (2 + (n + 1) / 2) = 2 * ((4 + n + 1) / 2) = (8 + 2n + 2) / 2 = (10 + 2n) / 2 = 5 + n`

So, the new value of `segments_needed` is `5 + n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `min_segments_needed` is \(2 + 2 \times n\), `a` is 2, `b` is \(\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right)\), `segments_needed` is \(5 + n\)**
