You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum expected number of caught fishes. Specifically, the `coverage` function and the logic used in `func_1` do not accurately determine the optimal placement of the fishes.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Coverage Calculation**: The `coverage` function calculates the number of cells covered by the scoop-net but does not correctly handle the edge cases where the scoop-net is near the boundaries of the pond. This leads to an overestimation or underestimation of the actual coverage area.

2. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the highest coverage values, but this approach does not ensure that the chosen cells maximize the expected value of caught fishes. It simply tries to maximize the sum of coverages without considering the distribution of these coverages.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
- **Expected Output**: The optimal solution would be to place the fishes in cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) because placing them here maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. In this configuration, for any of the four possible positions of the scoop-net, the number of fishes inside is always 2.
- **Program Output**: The program will likely not achieve the expected output of 2.0000000000 due to the incorrect calculation of coverage and the heuristic approach used.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is needed to ensure that the placement of fishes maximizes the expected value of caught fishes. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming or a more precise greedy algorithm to handle the constraints and optimize the expected value calculation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5). Function coverage(x, y) returns the number of possible scoop-net positions covering the cell (x, y), where the scoop-net is a square of size r × r.
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n`.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_positions is (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5)`. It calculates and returns the average coverage per position. The average coverage is determined by populating a min-heap with the negative coverage values for each cell `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, where each cell's coverage is given by the `coverage` function, which returns the number of possible scoop-net positions covering the cell `(x, y)`. The function then pops `k` elements from the heap and subtracts their coverage values from the total coverage. After these operations, it returns the total coverage divided by the total number of possible positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `k` is greater than the number of cells in the grid, the function will only process as many cells as available in the heap.
2. If `r` is equal to `min(n, m)`, the `coverage` of each cell would be 1, and the total coverage calculation would reflect this.
3. If `r` is 1, the grid effectively becomes a linear array, and the total coverage calculation would reflect this change in dimensions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond where a fish is placed, n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, and r is a positive integer representing the side length of the scoop-net such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #`(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 2, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 2, 0))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond, the dimensions of the pond, and the side length of the scoop-net, respectively. It returns the number of cells that can be covered by the scoop-net centered at the cell `(x, y)` within the pond dimensions `(n, m)`.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), the function calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond. Specifically, it computes the number of cells in the pond that fall within the scoop-net's boundaries, which are defined by the radius `r` from the center cell `(x, y)`.

The function returns the value \((\min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - \max(x - r + 2, 0)) \times (\min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - \max(y - r + 2, 0))\). This expression ensures that the calculation respects the boundaries of the pond and correctly accounts for the cells covered by the scoop-net.

Potential edge cases include when the center cell `(x, y)` is close to the edges of the pond, where the minimum values might reach the edge of the pond, leading to a non-positive width or height for the coverage area. In such cases, the function will correctly compute the number of cells within the valid boundaries.

There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code, as it accurately implements the intended logic.
