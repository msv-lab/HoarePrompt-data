The function `coverage` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. `x` and `y` are integers representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond where a fish is placed. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, and `r` is a positive integer representing the side length of the scoop-net such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).

The function returns the value `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 2, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 2, 0))`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `coverage` is to accept coordinates `x` and `y`, dimensions `n` and `m`, and a scoop-net side length `r`, and return a calculated value based on the given formula.
