The code pushes a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` onto the heap. Here, `y` is `m`. The initial state includes `m` being at least 1, `n` being at least 0, and `heap` containing the tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` is now `m`.

After executing the code:

- A new tuple `(-coverage(x, m), x, m)` is added to the heap.
- The value of `m` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The heap now contains two tuples: the original one and the newly pushed one.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1; `n` is at least 0; `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` and `(-coverage(x, m), x, m)` where `y` and `m` are both equal to `m`.**
