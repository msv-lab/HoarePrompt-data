Output State: **`m` is exactly `n`, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5`.
   - The loop will execute `m` times, pushing a tuple into the heap for each `y` in the range `[0, m-1]`.

2. **Heap Operations:**
   - Each iteration of the loop pushes a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` into the heap.
   - The `-coverage(x, y)` ensures that the heap is maintained as a min-heap based on the negative coverage value, allowing efficient retrieval of the minimum coverage value.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop runs `m` times, and `m` is specified to be between `1` and `10^5`, the loop will push a tuple into the heap for each `y` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
   - The final value of `m` will be exactly `n` because the loop runs `n` times (as per the loop condition `range(m)`).

4. **Heap Content:**
   - The heap will contain tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `y` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - This means the heap will contain `n` tuples, each representing a different `y` value from `0` to `n-1`.

### Summary:
- **Variables:**
  - `m`: Exactly `n`.
  - `heap`: A list of tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `y` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`m` is exactly `n`, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`.**
