`total_coverage` is decremented by the value of `cov`. The value of `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap. Since the code does not affect any other variables, they remain unchanged. The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`m` is at least 0; `n` is at least 0; `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)`, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`, `k` must be greater than 0, `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap, `x` is the first index of the smallest tuple, `y` is the second index of the smallest tuple**
