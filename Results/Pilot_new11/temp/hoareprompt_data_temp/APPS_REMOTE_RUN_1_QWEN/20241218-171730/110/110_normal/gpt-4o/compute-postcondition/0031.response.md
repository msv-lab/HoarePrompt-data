The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the `heap` and assigns its values to `cov`, `x`, and `y`. The `heap` is a list of tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`.

- Before popping, the `heap` contained tuples excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)`.
- After popping, `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap, `x` is the first index of this smallest tuple, and `y` is the second index of this smallest tuple.

Since `heapq.heappop` removes the smallest element, the new `heap` will no longer contain the tuple `(cov, x, y)`. The rest of the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 0; `n` is at least 0; `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`; `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`; `k` is `k - 1`; `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap; `x` is the first index of the smallest tuple; `y` is the second index of the smallest tuple**
