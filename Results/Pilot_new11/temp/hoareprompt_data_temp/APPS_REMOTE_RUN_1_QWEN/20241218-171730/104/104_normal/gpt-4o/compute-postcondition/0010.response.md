The code snippet `print(max_erase)` simply prints the value of `max_erase`. This does not change the value of `max_erase` or any other variables. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `max_erase` is the maximum of the differences `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
