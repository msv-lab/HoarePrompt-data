Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `j - i - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If the condition `(a[k] - a[i] == k - i)` holds for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `j - i - 1`. Otherwise, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
