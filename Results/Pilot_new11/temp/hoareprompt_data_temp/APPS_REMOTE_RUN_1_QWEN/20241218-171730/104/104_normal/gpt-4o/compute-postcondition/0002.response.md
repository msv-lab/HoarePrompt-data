The code initializes the variable `max_erase` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `max_erase`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing n integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3; `max_erase` is 0**
