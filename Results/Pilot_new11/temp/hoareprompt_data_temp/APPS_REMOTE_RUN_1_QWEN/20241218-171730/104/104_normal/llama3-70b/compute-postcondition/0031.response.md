Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. This holds true because if the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` is satisfied for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, then `max_erase` is updated to `j - i - 1`. If the condition is not satisfied, `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
