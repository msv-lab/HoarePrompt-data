Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the array consists of consecutive elements without any gaps. Specifically, for the input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will output `0`, which is incorrect because JATC can erase up to 4 consecutive elements (e.g., erasing indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 would leave only the first element). The program fails to account for this scenario where the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased is not zero.
