The function accepts an integer \(n\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\). It calculates and prints the maximum value of \(a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). The function does not handle cases where \(n\) is less than 2 or when the input list does not strictly increase. If \(n = 1\), the function will print 0 because there are no pairs to compare.
