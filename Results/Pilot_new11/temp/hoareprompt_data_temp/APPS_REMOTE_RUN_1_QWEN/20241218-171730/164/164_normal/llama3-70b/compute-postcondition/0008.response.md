The code assigns the value of `i` to `t`. Given that `i` is 0, `t` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'T'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'T'**
