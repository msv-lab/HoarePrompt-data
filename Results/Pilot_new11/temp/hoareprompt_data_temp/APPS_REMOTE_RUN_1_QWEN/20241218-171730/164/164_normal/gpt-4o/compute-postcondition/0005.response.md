The code swaps the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. Given that `G_pos` was originally the index of the first occurrence of 'G' and `T_pos` was the index of the first occurrence of 'T', and `G_pos` is at a higher index than `T_pos`, the swap will make `G_pos` take the value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` take the value of `G_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the original value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is the original value of `G_pos`.**
