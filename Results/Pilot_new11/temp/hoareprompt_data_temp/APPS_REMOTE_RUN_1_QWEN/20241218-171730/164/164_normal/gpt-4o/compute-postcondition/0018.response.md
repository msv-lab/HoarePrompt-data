Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `G_pos`, `pos` is `pos + k`, and `reachable` is `False`. If `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `line[pos]` is not '#`, the program continues executing the next statement without changing these variables.***
