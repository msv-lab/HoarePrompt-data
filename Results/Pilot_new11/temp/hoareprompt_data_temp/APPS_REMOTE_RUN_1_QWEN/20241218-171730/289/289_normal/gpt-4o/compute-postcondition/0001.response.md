`max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Subtracting 1 from this value gives `max_games`. Since `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^18`, the bit length of `n` will be between 1 and 60 (since \(2^{60} > 10^{18}\)). Thus, `max_games` will be the bit length of `n` minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that 2 <= n <= 10^18; `max_games` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
