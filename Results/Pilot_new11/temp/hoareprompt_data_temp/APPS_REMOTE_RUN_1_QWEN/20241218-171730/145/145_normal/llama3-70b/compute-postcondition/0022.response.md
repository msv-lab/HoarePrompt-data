Postcondition: **`curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`, `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is increased by 1 if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`. Otherwise, `curr_sum` is still increased by the value of `digit`, `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments` remain unchanged.**
