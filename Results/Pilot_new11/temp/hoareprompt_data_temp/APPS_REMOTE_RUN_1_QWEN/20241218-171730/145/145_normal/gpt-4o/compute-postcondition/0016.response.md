`current_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` to its current value. The previous value of `current_sum` was the original value plus the integer value of `ticket[i-1]`, so the new value of `current_sum` is the original value plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The value of `segment_count` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1` also holds true.

Output State: **`current_sum` is the original value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`, `segment_count` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`**
