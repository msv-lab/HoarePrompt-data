You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the target sum is the sum of the first `segment_length - 1` digits, which is not necessarily correct. The program needs to check all possible ways to split the ticket into segments with equal sums, not just the first few digits.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123456
```

The correct output should be "YES" because the ticket can be divided into "12", "34", and "56", where each segment sums to 3. However, the provided program will not correctly identify this case because it does not properly calculate the target sum for different segment lengths. 

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible segment lengths and calculate the target sum dynamically for each segment length, checking if the entire ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and ticket is a string consisting of n digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: either `segment_count` is greater than 1 and `current_sum` is 0, or `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment processed and `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1, with `i` being `n-1` and `n` being the length of the ticket list.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive). It attempts to partition the digits of `ticket` into segments of varying lengths such that the sum of the digits in each segment is equal to a predetermined target sum. The target sum is calculated based on the first segment of the specified length.

The function iterates through all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculating the target sum for each length. For each segment length, it calculates the current sum of the digits in the current segment and checks if it matches the target sum. If it does, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count. After processing all segments, if the current sum is zero and the segment count is greater than 1, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is 2, the function will only check the first segment of length 1, which is always valid since the target sum will be the same as the single digit in the segment.
- If `n` is 1, the function should not execute because the precondition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 is not met, but the function should handle this edge case by returning 'NO' immediately without entering the loop.
- The function assumes that the `segment_sum` function is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the sum of the digits in the specified segment.

After the function concludes, the program state is that it either returns 'YES' if there exists at least one valid way to partition the `ticket` string into segments with equal sums, or 'NO' otherwise.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string consisting of n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ int(digit) ≤ 9 for each digit in ticket), start and end are integers such that 0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end' inclusive
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are both integers. The function also takes a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each digit is between `0` and `9`). The function calculates and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. The function correctly handles the specified range of indices, ensuring that `start` and `end` are within the bounds of the string `ticket`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will still execute the loop but will not include any digits in the sum since the range would be empty. If `start` or `end` are out of bounds (less than `0` or greater than or equal to the length of `ticket`), the function will raise an `IndexError` due to the slicing operation `ticket[i]` in the list comprehension.
