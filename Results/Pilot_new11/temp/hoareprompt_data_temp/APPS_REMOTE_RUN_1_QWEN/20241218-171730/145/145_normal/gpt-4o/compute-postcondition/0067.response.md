Postcondition: ***`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n - 1` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `current_sum` is either 0 (if `current_sum == target_sum`) or remains the previous value plus `ticket[i_prev + 2]` (if the condition is not met), `segment_count` is 3, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and `n` is the length of the `ticket` list.***
