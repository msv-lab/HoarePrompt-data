The code sets `curr_sum` to 0, which changes the value of `curr_sum` from its previous value (which was equal to `target_sum`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1**
