The code sets `current_sum` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `current_sum`, which was equal to `target_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `target_sum` remains unchanged
- `segment_length` remains unchanged
- `current_sum` is now 0
- `segment_count` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 1

Output State: **`target_sum` remains unchanged, `segment_length` remains unchanged, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
