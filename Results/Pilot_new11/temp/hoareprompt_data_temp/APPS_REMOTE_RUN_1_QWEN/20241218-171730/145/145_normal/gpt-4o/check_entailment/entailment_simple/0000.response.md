Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a given ticket is lucky based on the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of digits `n` and the ticket as a string, which matches the problem's input format.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function iterates over possible segment lengths (from 1 to `n-1`).
   - It calculates the target sum for each segment length using the helper function `segment_sum`.
   - It then attempts to split the ticket into segments with the target sum.
   - If a valid division into segments with equal sums is found, it returns "YES".
   - If no such division is found after all iterations, it returns "NO".

3. **Helper Function `segment_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of digits within a specified segment of the ticket.
   - It uses a straightforward summation approach, which is appropriate and efficient for the given constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums, matching the problem’s output requirements.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, thus meeting the requirements and ensuring correctness.
