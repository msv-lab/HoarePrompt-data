Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified:
   - It takes the number of digits `n` and the base `base_x` for the first number `X`.
   - It reads the digits of `X` into a list `digits_x`.
   - It then reads the number of digits `m` and the base `base_y` for the second number `Y`.
   - It reads the digits of `Y` into a list `digits_y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The program uses a helper function `func_1` to convert each number from its respective base to decimal. This conversion is done correctly by iterating over the digits and using the formula for converting a number from a given base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the result of the comparison.

4. **Output**: The program outputs a single character as required, without any additional characters or formatting.

Since the program handles all parts of the input correctly, converts the numbers to decimal accurately, and compares them as described in the problem statement, it meets all the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
