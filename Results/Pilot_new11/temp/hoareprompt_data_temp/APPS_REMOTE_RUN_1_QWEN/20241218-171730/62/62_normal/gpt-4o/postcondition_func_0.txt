The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and converts the number represented by these digits in the given base to its decimal form. The function iterates through each digit in the `digits` list, multiplying the current `decimal_value` by the `base` and adding the current digit to it. After processing all digits, the function returns the `decimal_value` which is the decimal representation of the number. This process handles all digits correctly without leading zeros and ensures that each digit is within the valid range for the given base (0 to base-1). The function does not handle invalid inputs such as a base less than 2 or greater than 40, or non-integer values for `digits` or `base`.
