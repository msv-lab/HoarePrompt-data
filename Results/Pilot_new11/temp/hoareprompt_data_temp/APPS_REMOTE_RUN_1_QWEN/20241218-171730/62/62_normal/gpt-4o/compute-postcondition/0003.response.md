Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `decimal_value` is the first element of the list `digits`, and `digits` is a list of integers.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `digits`. 

3. **Current Iteration**: In the previous iteration, `decimal_value` was set to the first element of the list `digits`. This means that the loop has already processed the first element once.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the next element in the list `digits`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `decimal_value` should now be the second element of the list `digits`.
   - Since we have moved to the next element, `digits` will be the same list but the next element will be processed in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there must still be elements left in the list `digits`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`decimal_value` is the second element of the list `digits`, `digits` is a list of integers**
