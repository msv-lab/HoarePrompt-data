Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input for \( n \) and \( b_x \) from the first line.
   - It then reads the digits of \( X \) from the second line.
   - Similarly, it reads \( m \) and \( b_y \) from the third line.
   - It reads the digits of \( Y \) from the fourth line.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly converts the list of digits of a number in a given base to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.
   - The function iterates over each digit, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit.
   - The function returns the final decimal value, which is the number represented by the list of digits in the specified base.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After converting both numbers to their decimal representations using `func_1`, the program compares the resulting values.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints either `<`, `>`, or `=`.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The program correctly handles all parts of the input as described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` accurately converts numbers from any base (2 to 40) to decimal, which is necessary for comparing the two numbers.
- The comparison logic ensures that the correct symbol (`<`, `>`, or `=`) is printed based on the decimal values of the two numbers.
- The program assumes valid input as stated in the problem description, which means there is no need to handle invalid inputs like non-lists or negative integers explicitly.

Given that the program follows the problem description without any deviations, it is correct.
