Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. Here's a detailed justification:

1. **Problem Description**: The task requires determining if it is possible to choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The solution uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to check if the periods of the garlands' lighting cycles are relatively prime.

2. **Code Logic**:
   - The program takes three integers \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) as input, which represent the periodicity of the garlands.
   - It calculates the GCD of \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), then further calculates the GCD of this result with \(k_3\).
   - If the final GCD is 1, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to ensure at least one garland is lit at any given time. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, ensuring that \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) are within the specified range and that the GCD calculations are performed accurately.
   - The program correctly handles the condition where the GCD is 1, ensuring that the output is "YES" in such cases, and prints "NO" otherwise.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.
   - The annotated version supports the correctness of the program, as it accurately describes the steps and the conditions checked.
   - There are no logical errors or missing cases in the provided code that would lead to incorrect outputs based on the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate and remains unchanged.
