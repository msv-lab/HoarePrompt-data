Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input values is 1. However, this approach is insufficient to determine if it's possible to light up at least one garland every second after turning them on. For instance, consider the input \( k_1 = 4 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), and \( k_3 = 3 \):

- The GCD of 4 and 2 is 2.
- The GCD of 2 and 3 is 1.

Based on the current logic, the program would print "YES" because the GCD is 1, but it's actually not possible to ensure that at least one garland is lit every second after they are turned on. The first garland lights up at seconds 1, 5, 9, etc., the second at 2, 4, 6, etc., and the third at 3, 6, 9, etc. There is no combination of start times that ensures at least one garland is lit every second.

A correct solution would involve checking if there exists a combination of start times \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that for each second \( t \geq \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \), at least one of the garlands is lit. This can be more complex and may require a different approach, such as ensuring the start times are chosen in a way that covers all gaps in lighting intervals.
