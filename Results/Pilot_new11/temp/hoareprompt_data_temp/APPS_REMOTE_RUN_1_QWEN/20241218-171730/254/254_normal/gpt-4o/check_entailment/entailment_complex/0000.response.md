Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from standard input using `input().split()`, which is consistent with the problem statement requiring three integers as input.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) using `math.gcd(k1, k2)`. This is a crucial step in determining the periodicity of the first two garlands.
   - It then calculates the GCD of the result with \( k_3 \) using `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`. This final GCD (`gcd_all`) represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals, which is essential for ensuring that there is at least one garland lit at any given time after the switch-on moment.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the final GCD (`gcd_all`) is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that Mishka can find a way to switch on the garlands so that at least one garland is lit at all times after the switch-on.
   - If the GCD is not 1, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to meet the condition.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the GCD calculation, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement's requirement to output 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether Mishka can achieve his goal by checking the GCD of the intervals. The use of the GCD ensures that the periods of the garlands' light cycles align appropriately, allowing at least one garland to be lit at any given time after the switch-on.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and adheres to the constraints and requirements outlined in the problem description, the program is correct.
