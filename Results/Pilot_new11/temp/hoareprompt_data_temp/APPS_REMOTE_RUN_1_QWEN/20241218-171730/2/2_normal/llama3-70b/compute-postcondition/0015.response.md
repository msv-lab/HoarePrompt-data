The code calculates the `digit_sum` as the sum of the digits of the current value of `i`. Initially, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, and `i` is `i + 2`. After executing the code, `digit_sum` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. Then, the initial value of `i + 2` would be `i_initial + 2`. Therefore, the initial value of `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i_initial + 2`.

After the code runs, `i` is updated to `i_initial + 2`. The code then recalculates `digit_sum` as the sum of the digits of this new value of `i`.

Since the initial value of `digit_sum` was the sum of the digits of `i_initial + 2`, and now `i` is `i_initial + 2`, `digit_sum` will be the same as its initial value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged**
