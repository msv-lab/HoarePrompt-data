The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. Given the initial state, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, and both `digit_sum` and `max_sum` are greater than `max_num`, which is originally equal to `i`.

After executing `max_num = i`, `max_num` now holds the value of `i`, and `max_sum` remains unchanged because no operation directly modified `max_sum`.

Output State: **`digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `i` is its original value, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is equal to `i`.**
