The initial state is such that `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, and `i` is `i + 2`. The code snippet is:
```python
max_sum = digit_sum
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `i + 2`.
2. The value of `i` is the initial value of `i + 2`.
3. The line `max_sum = digit_sum` assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`.

Since `digit_sum` is already the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, assigning it to `max_sum` does not change its value. The other variables (`i` and `digit_sum`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `max_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, `max_num` remains unchanged**
