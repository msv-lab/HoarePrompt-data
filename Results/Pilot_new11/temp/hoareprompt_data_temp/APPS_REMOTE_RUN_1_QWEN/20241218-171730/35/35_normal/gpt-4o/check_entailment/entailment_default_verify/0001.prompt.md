You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake. However, there is a logical flaw in the `can_distribute` function.

The condition `a // x + b // x >= n` checks if the total number of plates needed to distribute the pieces of cake is less than or equal to \( n \). This condition is correct but the binary search implementation does not properly account for the distribution constraints.

Let's consider a specific example:

**Example:**
- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 6`, `b = 9`
- Expected Output: `3`

However, the program incorrectly returns `2`.

Here’s why:
- If \( x = 3 \), then \( 6 // 3 + 9 // 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is greater than or equal to 4, so `x = 3` should be valid.
- The program returns `2` because it finds the first value that satisfies the condition in the binary search.

The issue lies in the binary search implementation. The `low` and `high` values are set to 1 and `min(a, b) + 1`, which might not correctly capture the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.

A correct approach would involve checking the distribution directly without relying on binary search, ensuring that the conditions are met correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x` and returns whether the sum of `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and `n` is the number of plates. The function checks if each cake can be evenly distributed among the plates without leaving any remainder. If the sum of the pieces of both cakes divided by `x` is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 (resulting in `a + b // x`), and when `x` is greater than `a` or `b` (resulting in `a // x + b // x` being 0).+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
