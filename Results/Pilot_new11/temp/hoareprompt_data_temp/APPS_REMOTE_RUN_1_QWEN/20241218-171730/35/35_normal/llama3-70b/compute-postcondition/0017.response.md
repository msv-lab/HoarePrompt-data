The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function should work with three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The return value depends on the relationship between these integers.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function definition, we need to infer the behavior based on the constraints and the possible outputs. Since the function does not explicitly accept parameters but works with `n`, `a`, and `b` under certain constraints, we can describe its functionality in terms of these implicit parameters.

Functionality: **The function works with implicit parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. Depending on the relationship between these values, the function returns a specific value.**
