The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer with 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer with 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and the following conditions are met: `a` ≥ `x`, `b` ≥ `x`, and `(a - x + (b - x)) ≥ x`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
