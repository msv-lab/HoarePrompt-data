#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; `low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is the maximum value of `low` and `high` when the loop terminates.
    return low - 1
    #`The program returns the value of low minus 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). It uses binary search to find the maximum integer `low` such that `n` can be distributed starting from `low`. The function returns `low - 1`. If `n` cannot be distributed starting from any integer within the range, the function will return `a + b - 1`.

The function ensures that the initial search range is set between 1 and the minimum of `a` and `b` plus one. It iteratively narrows down the search range until `low` equals `high`. At the end of the loop, `low` is set to `high`, which represents the maximum integer where `n` can still be distributed. The function then returns `low - 1`, which is the largest integer from which `n` can be successfully distributed.

Potential edge cases include:
1. If `n` is larger than both `a` and `b`, the function will return `a + b - 1`.
2. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function will return `a` or `b` respectively, minus one.

The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are less than 1 or `n` is less than 2, as these are outside the specified constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x + b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x` and returns whether the sum of `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and `n` is the number of plates. The function checks if each cake can be evenly distributed among the plates without leaving any remainder. If the sum of the pieces of both cakes divided by `x` is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 (resulting in `a + b // x`), and when `x` is greater than `a` or `b` (resulting in `a // x + b // x` being 0).
