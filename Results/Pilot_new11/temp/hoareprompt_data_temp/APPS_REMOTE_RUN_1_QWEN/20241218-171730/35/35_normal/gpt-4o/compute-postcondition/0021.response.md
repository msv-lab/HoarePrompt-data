Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). It uses binary search to find the maximum integer `low` such that `n` can be distributed starting from `low`. The function returns `low - 1`. If `n` cannot be distributed starting from any integer within the range, the function will return `a + b - 1`.

The function ensures that the initial search range is set between 1 and the minimum of `a` and `b` plus one. It iteratively narrows down the search range until `low` equals `high`. At the end of the loop, `low` is set to `high`, which represents the maximum integer where `n` can still be distributed. The function then returns `low - 1`, which is the largest integer from which `n` can be successfully distributed.

Potential edge cases include:
1. If `n` is larger than both `a` and `b`, the function will return `a + b - 1`.
2. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function will return `a` or `b` respectively, minus one.

The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are less than 1 or `n` is less than 2, as these are outside the specified constraints.**
