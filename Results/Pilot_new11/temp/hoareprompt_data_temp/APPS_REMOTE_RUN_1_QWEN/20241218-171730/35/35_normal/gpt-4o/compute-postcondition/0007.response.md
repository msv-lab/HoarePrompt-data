Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), and `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise `can_distribute(mid)` returns False.***

This postcondition covers both cases:
- If `can_distribute(mid)` returns True, then `mid` is adjusted to \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\) and \(\high\) is set to \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
- If `can_distribute(mid)` returns False, then `low` is set to 1 and \(\high\) is set to \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\).
