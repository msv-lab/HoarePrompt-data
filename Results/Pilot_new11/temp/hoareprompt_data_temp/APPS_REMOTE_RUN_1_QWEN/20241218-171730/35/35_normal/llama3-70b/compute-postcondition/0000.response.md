The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, the input must adhere to these constraints.

After executing this line of code, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they were in the initial state, and `n` is updated to the value of the first integer entered by the user, `a` to the second integer, and `b` to the third integer. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.**
