The code sets `x_found` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `marks`, `mark`, `x`, or `marks_set`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `x_found`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `x` are such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is True**
