According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. For the loop to execute, the key state to consider is the nature of the `marks` list itself. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as the `marks` list is not empty.

Let's break down the states step by step:

1. **`marks` List**: The loop will execute if the `marks` list is non-empty.
2. **`i` and `j` Values**: The problem statement mentions that `i` and `j` are the last values they took during the loop. However, these specific values (`i` and `j`) are not directly relevant to the loop's condition since the loop will iterate through all elements in the `marks` list regardless of their last values.
3. **`need_x` and `need_y` Flags**: These flags determine the conditions under which certain checks are performed within the loop. However, the initial values of `need_x` and `need_y` do not affect whether the loop executes; they only influence the loop's behavior.
4. **`additional_marks` List**: This list contains `x` and `y`, but its contents do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Given this analysis, the primary state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is the `marks` list.

State: **`marks` is a non-empty list of integers**.
