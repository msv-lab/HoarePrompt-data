Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and `j`.
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `j` is the first element in the `additional_marks` list.

2. **Understand the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in the `additional_marks` list.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the current element being processed from `additional_marks`.
   - For the loop to continue, `additional_marks` must still be a non-empty list, and `j` must be the next element in this list.

4. **Update the states:**
   - `i` remains the next element in the `marks` list because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` becomes the next element in the `additional_marks` list for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `additional_marks` must be a non-empty list (since it was non-empty at the start and no elements were removed).
   - `j` is now the second element in the `additional_marks` list (the next element).

Given these steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`), `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, and `j` is the second element in the `additional_marks` list.**
