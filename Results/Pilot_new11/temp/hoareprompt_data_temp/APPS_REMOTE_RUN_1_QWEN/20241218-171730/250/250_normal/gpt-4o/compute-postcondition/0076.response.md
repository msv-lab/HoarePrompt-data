Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`. If any of the conditions involving `mark + x`, `mark + y`, `mark - x`, or `mark - y` are met during the loop, `new_marks` will include the corresponding transformed values. If no such conditions are met, `new_marks` will remain unchanged. The current value of `new_marks` depends on whether any conditions were met during the loop execution.***
