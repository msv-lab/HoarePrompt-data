Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, and `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains `mark + y`. Otherwise, `new_marks` contains `mark - y` and possibly other elements from the original `new_marks` set.***
