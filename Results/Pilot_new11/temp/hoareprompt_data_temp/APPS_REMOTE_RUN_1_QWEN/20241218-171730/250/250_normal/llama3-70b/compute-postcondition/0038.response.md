The code `need_y = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The other variables (`marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, `n`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` remains the same, `i` is the same, `j` is `i + 3`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

Output State: **`marks` remains the same, `i` is the same, `j` is `i + 3`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3**.
