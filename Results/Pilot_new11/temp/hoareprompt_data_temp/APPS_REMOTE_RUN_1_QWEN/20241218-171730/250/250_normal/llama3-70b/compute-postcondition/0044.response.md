The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `marks[j] - marks[i]`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is between 6 and 9 inclusive, `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, and `need_x` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is between 6 and 9 inclusive, `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, and `need_x` is `True`**
