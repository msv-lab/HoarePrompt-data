The code creates a new empty set called `new_marks`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set.
