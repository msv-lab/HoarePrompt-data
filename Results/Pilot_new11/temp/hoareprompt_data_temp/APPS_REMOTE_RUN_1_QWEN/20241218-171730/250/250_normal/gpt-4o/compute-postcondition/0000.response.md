`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains as a strictly increasing sequence of integers where `0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a strictly increasing sequence of integers where 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l.**
