To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the `for` loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the length of `marks` before removing duplicates.
- `l` is the maximum value in `marks`.
- `x` is its original value.
- `y` is its original value.
- `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from `marks`.
- `marks` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for mark in marks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`marks`**: The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. For the loop to execute, `marks` must contain at least one element.
2. **`n`**: This variable represents the length of `marks` before duplicates were removed. Since the loop iterates through `marks`, `n` being zero or negative would mean `marks` is empty, and thus the loop wouldn't execute.
3. **`l`**, `x`, and `y`: These variables are related to specific values within the `marks` list but don't directly affect the loop's execution unless they are used in the loop body (which is omitted here).
4. **`marks_set`**: This set contains unique elements from `marks`, but it is not directly used in the loop.
5. **`x_found` and `y_found`**: These flags are used within the loop body to indicate whether certain conditions are met. Their current states (`False`) do not impact the loop's ability to execute.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `marks` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, which implies that `marks` is non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list**
