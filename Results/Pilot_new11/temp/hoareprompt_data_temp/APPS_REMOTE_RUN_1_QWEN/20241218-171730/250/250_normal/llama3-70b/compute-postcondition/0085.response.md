According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `additional_marks`. The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.
- `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. `additional_marks` must still contain elements that satisfy the condition \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.
2. `i` must be updated to the next element in the `marks` list.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Check if `additional_marks` is non-empty**: Since `additional_marks` was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration and the loop continues as long as `additional_marks` contains elements, `additional_marks` should still be non-empty.
2. **Update `i`**: `i` is the next element in the `marks` list. Therefore, after processing the current element `j` in the loop, `i` should be set to the next element in `marks`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted such that `additional_marks` is non-empty and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
