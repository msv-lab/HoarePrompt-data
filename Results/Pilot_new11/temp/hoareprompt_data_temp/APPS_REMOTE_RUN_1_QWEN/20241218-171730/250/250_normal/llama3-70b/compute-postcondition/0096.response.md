Postcondition: ***`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and `j`. `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, and `j` is the first element in the `additional_marks` list.***

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition of the if statement directly serves as the overall postcondition for the if-else block. The condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` ensures that the sum of `i` and `j` is added to `additional_marks` if the condition is met.
