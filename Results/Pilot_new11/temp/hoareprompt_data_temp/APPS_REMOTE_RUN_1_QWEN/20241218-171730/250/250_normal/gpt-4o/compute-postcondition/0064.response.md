Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `marks` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is an empty set initially.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each element `mark` in `marks`.

### Loop Body:
For each `mark` in `marks`:
- If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`.
- If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`.
- Otherwise, `new_marks` contains `mark - x` if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y` if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, or remains unchanged.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- The specific value of `mark` has been processed.
- `new_marks` contains the result based on the conditions mentioned above.
- `x_found` and `y_found` remain as they were before the loop.

### For the Next Iteration:
- The value of `mark` will be the next element in the list `marks`.
- `new_marks` will be updated based on the new `mark`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `marks` remains unchanged.
- `marks_set` remains unchanged.
- `x_found` remains unchanged.
- `y_found` remains unchanged.
- `new_marks` will contain the updated set based on the next `mark`.

### New State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the results based on the next `mark` in `marks`.**

To be more specific about the `new_marks` state, we would need the actual value of the next `mark` in the list, but without that information, we can only describe it in terms of the next iteration's behavior.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the next `mark` in `marks`.**
