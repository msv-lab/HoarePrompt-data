The code adds `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was initially a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition inside the if-else block, adding `mark + y` will update this set. However, the initial condition for `new_marks` is not directly impacted by the addition of `mark + y` because the original set's content depends on the evaluation of the if condition involving `x`.

The output state will reflect that `new_marks` now contains `mark + y`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y`, and the if condition `(mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set)` is being evaluated.**
