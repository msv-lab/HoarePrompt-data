The code `y_found = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `y_found`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the length of `marks` before removing duplicates, `l` is the maximum value in `marks`, `x` is its original value, `y` is its original value, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from `marks`, `marks` is a list of integers derived from the input, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`**.
