The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` (an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` (integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` (a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l). 

Case_1: The function returns the sublist of `a` from index `x` to index `y` inclusive.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`, and return the sublist of `a` from index `x` to index `y` inclusive.
