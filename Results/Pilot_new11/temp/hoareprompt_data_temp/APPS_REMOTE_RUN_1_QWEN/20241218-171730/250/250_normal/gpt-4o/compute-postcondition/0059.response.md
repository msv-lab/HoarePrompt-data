The code adds `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, or the unchanged nature of `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y`.**
