The code sets `need_x` to `True`. This affects only the variable `need_x`. The values of the other variables (`marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_y`, and `j_end`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is the same as before unless `marks[j_end + 1] - marks[i] == y`, in which case `need_y` is `True`.**
