The code `marks = set(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a set of these integers. This affects the `marks` variable, while the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`) remain unaffected.

Since the input is split and converted to integers, the `marks` variable now holds a set of integers from the input. The exact values in the set depend on the user's input, but the structure of the set is new.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `l` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `y` is an integer read from input, and `x < y`; `marks` is a set of integers from the input**
