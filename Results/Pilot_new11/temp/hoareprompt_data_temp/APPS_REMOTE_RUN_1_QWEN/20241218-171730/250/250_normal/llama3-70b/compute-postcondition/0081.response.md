State before the loop starts: `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` is a non-empty list, the loop will definitely execute at least once.
2. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over each element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` is non-empty and contains valid elements that can be assigned to `j`.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The problem statement mentions that `i` is the next element in the `marks` list. This means `i` is ready to be used within the loop.

Given these points, the key states that need adjustment are:
- `additional_marks` should be a non-empty list.
- `i` should be the next element in the `marks` list, which is ready to be used.

The state before the loop does not need to be adjusted further because the conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied based on the given information.

Therefore, the final state before the loop is:
**`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**

No additional adjustments are needed.
