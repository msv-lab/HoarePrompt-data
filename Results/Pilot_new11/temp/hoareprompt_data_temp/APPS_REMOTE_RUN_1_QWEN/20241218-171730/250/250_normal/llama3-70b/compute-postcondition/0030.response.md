Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `marks` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is the current index.
   - `j` is `i + 1`.
   - `need_x` is `True` because `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` was found.
   - `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.
   - `n` is the length of the `marks` list, where `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = n - 1`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the previous value of `j` (let's call it `j_prev`).

4. **Updating States:**
   - `i` remains the same as it did not change within the loop.
   - `j` needs to be updated to `j_prev + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `need_x` remains `True` because the condition was met previously.
   - `need_y` remains `True` unless a specific condition changes it to `False` within the loop body.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.
   - `j` must be less than `n`.

Given the above analysis, the states to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` remains the same.
- `j` is updated to `j_prev + 1`.
- `need_x` remains `True`.
- `need_y` remains `True`.
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same index as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**.
