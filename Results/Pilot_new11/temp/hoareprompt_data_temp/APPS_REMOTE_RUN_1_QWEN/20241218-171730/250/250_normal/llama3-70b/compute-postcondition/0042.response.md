State before the loop starts: `i` is 6, `n` is 10

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 6 and `n` is 10, the loop condition `j in range(i, n)` translates to `j in range(6, 10)`. This means `j` can take any integer value from 6 to 9 (inclusive).

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the initial state such that `j` falls within the range defined by `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` must be between 6 and 9 inclusive**
