The code `need_y = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The value of `need_x` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True**.
