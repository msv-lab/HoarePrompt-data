The code appends `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state, `i` is the next element in the `marks` list and `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.

After executing the line `additional_marks.append(i + j)`:
- The value of `additional_marks` will be the original list plus the new element `i + j`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged because it is not being modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and now includes the new element `i + j`; `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and now includes the new element `i + j`; `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
