Functionality: **The function `func` accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` (an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` (integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` (a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l). It first checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` in the list `a` such that `a[j] - a[i] == x` or `a[j] - a[i] == y`. If no such pairs exist for `x`, it adds `x` to `additional_marks`. Similarly, if no such pairs exist for `y`, it adds `y` to `additional_marks`. Then, it iterates through the `marks` set and for each mark, it adds to `additional_marks` any value that can be formed by adding an element from `additional_marks` to the current mark, ensuring the sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. Finally, it prints the length of `additional_marks` followed by its elements in space-separated form.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If both `x` and `y` do not exist in the differences between any two marks, `additional_marks` will only contain `x` and `y`, and the output will reflect this.
- The function assumes `x` and `y` are positive integers and `x < y`. If these conditions are not met, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `x` or `y` might be zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function does not validate the inputs `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` to ensure they fall within the specified ranges. If invalid inputs are provided, the function may behave unexpectedly or raise errors.
