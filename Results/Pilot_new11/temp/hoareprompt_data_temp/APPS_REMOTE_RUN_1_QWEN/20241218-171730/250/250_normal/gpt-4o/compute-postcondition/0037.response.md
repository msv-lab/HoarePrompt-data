`new_marks` is updated to include the value `mark + x`. Since `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is already in `marks_set`, adding `mark + x` to `new_marks` does not change the fact that `x_found` is still `False` because there is no mention of finding `x` in the given code. The values of `y_found`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`, and the condition `not x_found` is true**
