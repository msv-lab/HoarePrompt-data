`subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks + 1`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `num_processed`, `t` are integers within their specified ranges; `subtasks_solved` is `0`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.**
