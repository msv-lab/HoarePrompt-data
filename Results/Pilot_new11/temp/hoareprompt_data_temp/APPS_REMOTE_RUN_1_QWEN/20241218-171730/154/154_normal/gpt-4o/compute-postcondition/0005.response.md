The code `break` does not affect any variables' values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the execution simply ends here. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `max_points` is 0**
