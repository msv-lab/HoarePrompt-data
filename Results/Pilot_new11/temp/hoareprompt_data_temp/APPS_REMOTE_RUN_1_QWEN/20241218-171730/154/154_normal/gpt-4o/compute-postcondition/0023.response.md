`subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the previous iteration, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `num_processed` remains unchanged, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `max_points`, and `points` remain unchanged, and `num_processed < k` must hold for the loop to execute again.**
