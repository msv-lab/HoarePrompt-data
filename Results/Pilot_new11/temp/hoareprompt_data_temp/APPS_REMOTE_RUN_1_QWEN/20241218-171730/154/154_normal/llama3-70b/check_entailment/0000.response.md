Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). The program iterates over the time required for each subtask and uses a DP table to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned up to each subtask and within each time limit. Finally, it sums up the points from the DP table and adds the extra points for fully completing tasks. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
