The code `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` assigns the product of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task` to `time_used`. However, the values of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task` are not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, we can only state that `time_used` is the result of multiplying `complete_tasks` by `total_time_per_task`.

The output state includes the updated variable `time_used` and retains the unchanged variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is complete_tasks * total_time_per_task, `max_points` is 0**
