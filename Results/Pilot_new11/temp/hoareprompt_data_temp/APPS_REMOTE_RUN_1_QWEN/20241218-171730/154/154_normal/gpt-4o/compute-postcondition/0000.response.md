The code `total_time_per_task = sum(t)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `t` and assigns it to the variable `total_time_per_task`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45.
- `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9.
- `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`.**
