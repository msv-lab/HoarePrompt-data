The code snippet updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. However, since `max_points` is not initially defined in the context, it will be initialized to `points + subtasks_solved` if this is the first time it is being set. The initial state of `subtasks_solved` is given by `min(initial_subtasks_solved, (initial_n - initial_complete_tasks) * initial_k)`. 

After running the code, the only change is that `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. Since `max_points` was not defined before, it gets the value of `points + subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`subtasks_solved` is min(`initial_subtasks_solved`, (`initial_n` - `initial_complete_tasks`) * `initial_k`), `max_points` is points + `subtasks_solved`**
