The code updates `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now the same as the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` according to the initial state.

From the initial state, we know:
- If `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]`.
- If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

However, the current line of code only updates `dp[i][j]` based on `dp[i][j - 1]`, which does not depend on the conditions related to `t[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state for `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`; if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i - 1]] + 1`; `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
