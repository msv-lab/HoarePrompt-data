Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input as a single string and splits it into individual components. These components are then converted into integers for `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`.
   - This matches the problem description's input format, where the first line contains three integer numbers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and the second line contains `k` integer numbers representing the time required to solve each subtask.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through all possible numbers of tasks (`complete_tasks`) that can be fully completed within the given time `M`.
   - For each possible number of tasks, it calculates the total time used and the corresponding points earned.
   - It then calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for the remaining time, ensuring that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining time or the remaining tasks.
   - The function updates the maximum points achievable by considering the current points plus the subtasks solved.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the number of tasks (`n`) or subtasks per task (`k`) is zero, ensuring that the logic does not attempt to divide by zero or perform invalid operations.
   - The function also ensures that the remaining time is never negative by limiting the number of subtasks solved based on the remaining time and the number of remaining tasks.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is consistent with the problem statement's requirement to output the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in `M` minutes.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handling all relevant cases and edge scenarios appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
