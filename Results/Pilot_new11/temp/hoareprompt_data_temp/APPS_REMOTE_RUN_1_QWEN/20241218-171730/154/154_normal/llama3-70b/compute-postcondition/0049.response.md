Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value obtained by either keeping the previous value `dp[i][j - 1]` or updating it based on the condition `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`. The loop executes for all valid combinations of `i` and `j` where `1 <= i <= k` and `1 <= j <= M`.**
