According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop starts from 1 and ends at `M`, so for the loop to execute, `M` must be at least 1. Additionally, before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 1, which means `i` should be `1` since `j` starts from 1 in the range function.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `i` is `k + 1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 1 to `M`.

For the loop to execute:
- `M` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` should start from 1, so `i` should be 1 at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to 1 and `M` is at least 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `M` must be greater than or equal to 1**
