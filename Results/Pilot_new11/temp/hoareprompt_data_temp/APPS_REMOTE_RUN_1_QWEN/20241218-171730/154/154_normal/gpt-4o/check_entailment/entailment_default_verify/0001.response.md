Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given the constraints. The original assessment correctly identified that the program handles all potential cases as described. 

The output hints confirm that the function iterates through all possible numbers of tasks that can be completed within the given time, calculates the total time used and corresponding points, and then calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for the remaining time. The function updates the maximum points achievable by considering the current points plus the subtasks solved. 

The potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints (e.g., `M` being zero or the list `t` being empty) are indeed handled by the program's logic, as it ensures that no invalid inputs lead to incorrect results. For instance, if `M` is zero, no tasks can be completed, resulting in zero points. If `t` is an empty list, the function correctly handles this by not considering any subtasks, again leading to zero points. 

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description and requirements as specified.
