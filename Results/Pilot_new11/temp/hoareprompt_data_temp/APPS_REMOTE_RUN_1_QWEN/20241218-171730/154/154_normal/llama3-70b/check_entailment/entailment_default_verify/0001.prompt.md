You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). The logic in the program correctly handles the constraints and the scoring rules described in the problem statement. 

- The program sorts the times required to solve each subtask, which helps in efficiently building the DP table.
- The DP table `dp[i][j]` is used to store the maximum number of points that can be earned using the first `i` subtasks with `j` minutes available.
- The program correctly updates the DP table by considering whether to include the current subtask or not.
- Finally, the program sums up the points from the DP table and adds the extra point for completing tasks.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to cover all necessary cases without any logical flaws. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers. It first reads these inputs from standard input. Then, it sorts the list `t`. The function uses dynamic programming to fill a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of elements from the first `i` elements of `t` that can be selected such that their sum does not exceed `j`.

After populating the `dp` table, the function calculates and returns the sum of the last row of the `dp` table (`dp[k][M]`) plus the count of indices `i` where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`. This sum effectively gives the total number of elements that can be selected from the list `t` without exceeding the limit `M`, along with a count of those selections that fully utilize the limit `M`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input values for `n`, `k`, or `M` do not meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), the function will raise an error since it relies on these constraints to properly initialize and use the `dp` table. However, the provided annotations do not explicitly handle this case, so the function should be modified to handle invalid inputs appropriately.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it prints and returns a single integer value representing the sum of the last row of the `dp` table plus the count of indices where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`. This value indicates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from `t` such that their sum does not exceed `M`, with a special consideration for selections that exactly reach the limit `M`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
