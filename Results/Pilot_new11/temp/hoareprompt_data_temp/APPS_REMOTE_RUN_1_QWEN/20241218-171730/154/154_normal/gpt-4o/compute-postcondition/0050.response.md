The code subtracts `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. We know that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. So, the updated `remaining_time` will be `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

Let's denote the initial value of `remaining_time` as `R`. Then, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `R // subtask_time`. Therefore, the new value of `remaining_time` will be:

\[ \text{new\_remaining\_time} = R - (R // \text{subtask_time}) \times \text{subtask_time} \]

Since `R // \text{subtask_time}` gives the quotient of `R` divided by `subtask_time` (integer division), the above equation simplifies to zero because `(R // \text{subtask_time}) * \text{subtask_time}` is exactly `R` when `R` is perfectly divisible by `subtask_time`.

If `R` is not perfectly divisible by `subtask_time`, then the remainder will be subtracted from `R`, making `remaining_time` the remainder when `R` is divided by `subtask_time`.

Given the specifics, the updated values are:
- `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, which simplifies to the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
