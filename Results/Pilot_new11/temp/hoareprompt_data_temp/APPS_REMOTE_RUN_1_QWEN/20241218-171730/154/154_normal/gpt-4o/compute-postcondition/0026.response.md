Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `M` is an integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\); `t` is a list of `k` integers where each `t_j` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\); `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`; `time_used` is greater than `M`; `max_points` is 0; `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`; `subtasks_solved` is the sum of the integer divisions of `remaining_time` by each `subtask_time` for all valid subtasks; `remaining_time` is the final remaining time after processing all subtasks; `num_processed` equals `k` if the loop processed all subtasks, otherwise it is less than `k`.**
