Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is increased by 1, and `l` is equal to `r + 1` if the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` is true. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the if condition's evaluation.***
