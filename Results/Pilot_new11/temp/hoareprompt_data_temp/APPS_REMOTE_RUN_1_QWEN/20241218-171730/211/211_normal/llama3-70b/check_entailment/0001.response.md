Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the subarrays formed do not overlap and cover the entire original array. Let's consider the following input:

```
Input:
4
1 -2 2 -1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
YES
1
1 4
```

This is incorrect because the subarray `[1, -2, 2, -1]` has a sum of `0`, which violates the constraint that no subarray can have a sum of `0`. The program should split the array into non-overlapping subarrays with non-zero sums. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
