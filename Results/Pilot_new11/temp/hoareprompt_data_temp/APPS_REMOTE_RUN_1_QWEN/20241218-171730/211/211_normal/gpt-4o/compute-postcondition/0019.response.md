The code prints the value of `1` followed by `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially set to 1, `i + 1` will be 2. This means the console will output '1 2'. The variables `n`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2'**
