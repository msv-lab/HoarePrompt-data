Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, and `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, the console displays 'NO'. Otherwise, `k` is the number of times the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was met plus 1, `l` is the last value of `r` that satisfied the condition, or 1 if no such `r` exists, and `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. The values of `k`, `l`, and `n` are printed.**
