Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to identify a subarray whose sum is zero and then splits the array accordingly. However, the problem requires splitting the array into multiple parts such that the sum of elements in each part is non-zero and the concatenation of these parts forms the original array.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Objective**: The program tries to find a subarray with a sum of zero and outputs "NO" if such a subarray exists. This is contrary to the problem statement, which requires splitting the array into parts where each part's sum is non-zero.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero to determine if the entire array can be split as required. If `prefix_sum[n]` is zero, it prints "NO". However, this logic is flawed because even if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero, it still needs to check if the array can be split into non-zero sum subarrays. For instance, consider the array `[1, -1, 1, -1]`. Here, the entire array sums to zero, but it can be split into subarrays `[1, -1]` and `[1, -1]`, each with a non-zero sum.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Zero Sum Subarrays**: The program uses a single counter `k` and tries to identify subarrays by checking `prefix_sum[r]` against `prefix_sum[n]`. This approach does not guarantee that the subarrays will have non-zero sums. It also fails to handle cases where multiple valid splits exist.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```

However, the program would output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero, which is not the case here, but it doesn't proceed to find and print the correct subarrays as required.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the prefix sums.
2. Identify all subarrays with non-zero sums.
3. Ensure that the concatenation of these subarrays forms the original array.
4. Print "YES" and the indices of the subarrays if possible; otherwise, print "NO".

Thus, the given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
