The code snippet `print('1')` does not affect any variables. It simply prints the string '1' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output to the console, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is not equal to 0; printed value is '1'**
