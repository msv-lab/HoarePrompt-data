Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`, and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0**
