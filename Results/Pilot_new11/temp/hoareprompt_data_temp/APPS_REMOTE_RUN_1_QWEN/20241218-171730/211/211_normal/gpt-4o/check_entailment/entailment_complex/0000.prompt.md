You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list of integers represents the array A with length n, where each element a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`; if `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the console outputs '1' followed by the value of `n`; if `total_sum` is 0, the console outputs 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array \(A\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) with elements satisfying \(-10^3 \leq a_{i} \leq 10^3\). It checks if the sum of the elements in the array is zero. If the sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the value of \(n\). If the sum is zero, it iterates through the array to find the first non-zero element and prints 'YES' followed by '2', then the indices of two segments that together cover the non-zero element (i.e., '1' and the index of the non-zero element, and the index of the non-zero element plus one and 'n'). If no non-zero element is found, it prints 'NO'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
