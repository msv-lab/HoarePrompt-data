According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, but since the initial condition already specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, we know that `n` is valid for the loop to start.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\)
- `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0

Since `total_sum` being 0 does not impact the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range. However, since the problem statement already confirms that `n` is within this range, no further adjustment to `n` is needed.

The state before the loop starts remains as given, and the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the valid range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), and `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0**
