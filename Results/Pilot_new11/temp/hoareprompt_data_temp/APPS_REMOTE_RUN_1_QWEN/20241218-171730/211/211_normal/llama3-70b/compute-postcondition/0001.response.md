The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers. This affects the variable `a`, while `n` remains unchanged. The initial state of the array `A` remains unchanged as well.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- The initial state of the array `A` remains unchanged

After executing the code, `a` is updated to a list of integers based on the input, and `n` remains the same. The initial state of `A` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of integers based on the input; the initial state of the array `A` remains unchanged.**
