Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is a positive integer.
- \( \text{prefix\_sum} \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first \( i \) elements of the list \( a \).
- \( \text{prefix\_sum}[0] \) is always 0.
- \( \text{prefix\_sum}[i + 1] \) for \( 0 \leq i < n \) is the sum of the first \( i + 1 \) elements of \( a \).
- \( \text{prefix\_sum}[n] \) is not equal to 0.
- \( k = 1 \).
- \( l = 1 \).

### Loop Code:
```python
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
        print(k, l, r)
        k += 1
        l = r
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over \( r \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each \( r \), the loop checks if \( \text{prefix\_sum}[r] \neq 0 \) and \( \text{prefix\_sum}[r] \neq \text{prefix\_sum}[n] \).
   - If both conditions are true, the loop prints \( k \), \( l \), and \( r \), increments \( k \) by 1, and sets \( l \) to \( r \).

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - Each time the condition is met, \( k \) is incremented by 1.
   - Each time the condition is met, \( l \) is set to the current value of \( r \).
   - The loop continues until \( r \) reaches \( n \).

### Final State:
- If the loop executes \( m \) times (where \( m \leq n \)), then:
  - \( k \) will be \( m + 1 \).
  - \( l \) will be the last value of \( r \) that satisfied the condition, which is \( n \).

- If the loop does not execute at all (which happens when none of the \( \text{prefix\_sum}[r] \) satisfy the condition for \( r \) from 1 to \( n \)):
  - \( k \) remains 1.
  - \( l \) remains 1.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will execute at most \( n \) times, we can conclude the following:
- \( k \) will be the number of times the condition was met plus 1.
- \( l \) will be the last value of \( r \) that satisfied the condition, or 1 if no such \( r \) exists.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `k` is the number of times the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was met plus 1, `l` is the last value of `r` that satisfied the condition, or 1 if no such `r` exists, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0.**
