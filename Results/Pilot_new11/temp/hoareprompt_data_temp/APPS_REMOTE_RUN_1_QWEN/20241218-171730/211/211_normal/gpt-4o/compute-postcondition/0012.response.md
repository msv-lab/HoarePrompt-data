The given code prints the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since `i` is not initialized or assigned any value before this line, it cannot be determined what `i + 1` evaluates to. The only certain change is the print statement.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\)
- `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0
- The console outputs 'YES'

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its value or the value of `i + 1`. Therefore, the only certain change is the print statement, which outputs '1' followed by an undefined value for `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by an undefined value for `i + 1`**
