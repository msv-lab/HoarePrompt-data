The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, the value of `i` will be `2 + 2 * k + 1 = 2 * k + 3`.

The initial values of `n`, `k`, `positions`, and `i` are as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000
- `positions` is a list containing `[1]`
- `i` is 2

After executing the line `i += 2 * k + 1`, the value of `i` changes to `2 * k + 3`, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000; `positions` is a list containing [1]; `i` is 2 * k + 3**
