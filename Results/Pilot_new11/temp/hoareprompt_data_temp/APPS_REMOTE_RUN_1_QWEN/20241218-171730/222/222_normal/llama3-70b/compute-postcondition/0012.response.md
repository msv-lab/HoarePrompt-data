The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but rather uses two variables `n` and `k` which are constrained such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 1000`. The output has two cases:
- Case_1: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ 1000`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns `True`.
- Case_2: If the above condition is not met, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to check if `n` equals `k` where both `n` and `k` are within their respective ranges, and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

Functionality: **The function checks if `n` equals `k` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 1000`, and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise returns `False`.**
