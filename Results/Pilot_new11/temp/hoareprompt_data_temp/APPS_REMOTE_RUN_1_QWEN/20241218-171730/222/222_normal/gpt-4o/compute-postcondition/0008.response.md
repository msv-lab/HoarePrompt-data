To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n \geq 2 \cdot k + 3\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `positions` is a list containing `[1, 2 \cdot k + 3]`.
- `i` is `4 * k + 4`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while i <= n:`.

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i = 4 * k + 4`
- Since the loop condition is `i <= n`, at the end of the last iteration, `i` was equal to `n`.

### Determining the Next State:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n` must hold true. Since `i` is `4 * k + 4`, for the loop to continue, we need `4 * k + 4` to be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `i` was exactly equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, the only way for the loop to execute one more time is if `i` is incremented to `4 * k + 5` (the next integer after `4 * k + 4`).

However, since `i` starts at `4 * k + 4` and the loop increments `i` internally (not shown in the problem statement), the only way to satisfy `i <= n` for the next iteration is to ensure that `n` is at least `4 * k + 5`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be at least `4 * k + 5`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be at least `4 * k + 5`**
