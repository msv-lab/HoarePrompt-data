The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers with constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). The function constructs a list of integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) until the last value of `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing the list, it prints the length of the list and the list elements separated by spaces. There is no return value from the function; instead, it outputs the length and the list elements through `print` statements.
