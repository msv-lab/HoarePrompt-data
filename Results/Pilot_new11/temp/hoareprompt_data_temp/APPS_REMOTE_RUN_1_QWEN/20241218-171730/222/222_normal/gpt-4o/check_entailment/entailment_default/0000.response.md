Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function does not account for the correct sequence of actions to turn over all \( n \) skewers. Instead of turning every \( 2k + 1 \)th skewer, the code simply increments the position by \( 2k + 1 \), which is not a valid strategy to ensure all skewers are turned over in the minimum number of steps.

For example, consider \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 2 \):
- Turning skewer 1 would affect skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Turning skewer 6 would affect skewers 4, 5, 6, 7.

However, the current implementation does not cover all skewers correctly. A valid solution would require turning specific skewers to ensure all are turned over. The current approach might leave some skewers unturned or require more steps than necessary. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
