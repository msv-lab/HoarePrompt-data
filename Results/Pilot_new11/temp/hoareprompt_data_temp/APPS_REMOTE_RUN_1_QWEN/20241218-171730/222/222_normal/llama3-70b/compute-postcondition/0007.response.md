Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \) and \( n > k + 2 \)
- \( k \) is an integer where \( 0 \leq k \leq 1000 \)
- \( l = \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \) and \( l > 0 \)
- \( res \) is a list containing \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1, n + k]\)

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(l):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `l-1`.
   - After the previous iteration, the value of `i` was `i_max - 1` where `i_max` is the maximum value of `i` in the current iteration.
   
2. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is calculated as \( l = \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \).
   - Since \( l \) is an integer and \( l > 0 \), it represents the number of iterations the loop can perform.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- **`i`**: 
  - If the loop is to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_max`.

- **`l`**: 
  - `l` does not change within the loop unless the values of `n` or `k` change. Hence, `l` remains the same for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- At the end of the previous iteration, if the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i_max` (the previous value of `i` plus 1).

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- \( n \) remains the same.
- \( k \) remains the same.
- \( l \) remains the same.
- \( res \) remains the same.
- \( i \) becomes \( i_max + 1 \).

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \) and \( n > k + 2 \); \( k \) is an integer where \( 0 \leq k \leq 1000 \); \( l = \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \) and \( l > 0 \); \( res \) is a list containing \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1, n + k]\); `i` is \( i_max + 1 \)**
