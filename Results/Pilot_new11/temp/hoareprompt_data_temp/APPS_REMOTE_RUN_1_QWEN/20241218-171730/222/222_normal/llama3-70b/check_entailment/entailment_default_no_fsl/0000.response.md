Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to account for the scenario where \( n \leq k + 2 \). In such cases, the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \right\rfloor\) does not accurately represent the minimum number of actions required to turn over all \( n \) skewers.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 2`

According to the problem description, to turn over all 3 skewers with \( k = 2 \), only one action is needed (turning skewer 2 would turn over skewers 1, 2, and 3). However, the provided code would incorrectly calculate the number of actions as follows:

```python
(n, k) = (3, 2)
l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)  # (3 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 4 // 5 = 0
```

This results in `l` being 0, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code fails to handle this specific case, making it incorrect for the problem description.
