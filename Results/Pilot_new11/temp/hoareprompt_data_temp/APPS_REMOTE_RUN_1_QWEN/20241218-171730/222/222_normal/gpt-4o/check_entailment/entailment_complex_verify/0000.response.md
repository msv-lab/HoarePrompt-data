Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` constructs a list of integers starting from 1 and increasing by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) until the last value of `i` exceeds `n`. This construction implies that each action (turning a skewer) will only affect every \(2 \cdot k + 1\) skewers, which does not guarantee that all \(n\) skewers will be turned over with the minimum number of actions, especially when \(k = 0\).

For example, in the case where \(n = 5\) and \(k = 0\), the program constructs the list `[1, 3, 5]` and prints `3` for the number of actions, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct solution would be to turn each skewer individually, requiring 5 actions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, and the original assessment is correct.
