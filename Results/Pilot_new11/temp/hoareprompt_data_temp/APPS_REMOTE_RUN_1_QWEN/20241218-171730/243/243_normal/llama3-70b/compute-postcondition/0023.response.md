Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: `m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list; and `n // 5` is 0 (which means `n` is not divisible by 5).

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append(n)
```

This line appends the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is initially 1 and is not divisible by 5, it gets appended to the list `ans`.

Now, let's determine the updated values of the variables and the conditions:

- `m` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect `m`.
- `count` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect `count`.
- `n` remains 1, as the code does not change its value.
- `ans` is now `[1]` because `1` was appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 1; `ans` is `[1]`; and `n // 5` is 0.**
