The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. Given that `left` was initially set to `mid`, and `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `left` will be `mid - 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`, the value of `left` being decreased by 1 does not affect the condition `func_1(left) == m` directly, but it changes the value of `left` itself.

Here are the updated values:
- `m` remains within its bounds: \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` still satisfy `low <= high`.
- `left` is now `mid - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `left` is `mid - 1`**
