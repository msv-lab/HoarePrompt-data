The code snippet `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `right` was previously set to `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`. After the increment, the new value of `right` will be `mid + 3`, and `func_1(right)` will still equal `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`, `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `right` is now `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.**
