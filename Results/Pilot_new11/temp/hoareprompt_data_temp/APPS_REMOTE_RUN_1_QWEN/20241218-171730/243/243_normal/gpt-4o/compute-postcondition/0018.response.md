Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`
- `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 2\)
- `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m:`

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. From the given information, we know that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `func_1(left)` to continue the loop.

However, we need to consider the possible adjustments for the variables that might change during the loop execution:

1. **`low`**: The `low` variable might change if the loop adjusts the search range based on the value of `func_1(mid)`. But since we are continuing the loop and the condition is still met, `low` remains unchanged.
2. **`high`**: Similarly, the `high` variable might change. Since the condition `func_1(left) == m` is still true, `high` remains unchanged.
3. **`mid`**: The `mid` variable might change as part of the binary search process. However, since the loop condition is still met, `mid` remains unchanged.
4. **`left`**: This variable is derived from `mid` and `high`. If the loop continues, `left` should still be calculated based on the current `mid` and `high`.

Since none of these variables need to be explicitly adjusted to meet the loop condition, and the only state that needs to be ensured is that `func_1(left) == m` remains true, no further adjustments are required beyond ensuring the loop condition continues to hold.

### Conclusion:
No specific states need to be adjusted. The loop can proceed as long as the condition `func_1(left) == m` holds true.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 2\); `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`.**
