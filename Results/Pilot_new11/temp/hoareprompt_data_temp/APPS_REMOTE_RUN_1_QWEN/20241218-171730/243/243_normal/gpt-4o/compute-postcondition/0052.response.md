To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
- `left` is `mid - k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `right` is `mid + 3`.
- The loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `func_1(right)` to still equal `m` at the start of the next iteration.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `left = mid - k`
- `right = mid + 3`

### Required State for Next Iteration:
For the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m` at the start of the next iteration. Since `right` is `mid + 3`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 3)` still equals `m`.

### Adjustment Needed:
- We need to maintain the condition `func_1(right) == m` for the next iteration. This means `func_1(mid + 3)` must equal `m`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the states of `low`, `high`, `left`, or `right` based on the current information. However, we need to ensure that the condition `func_1(mid + 3) == m` holds true for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 3` and must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`**.

This ensures that the condition for the loop to continue executing remains valid for the next iteration.
