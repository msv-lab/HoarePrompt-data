The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the innermost enclosing structure. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional structure immediately preceding the `break` statement, the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 2; `ans` is `[1]`; and `n // 5` is 0.**
