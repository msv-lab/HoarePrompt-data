Output State: **`right` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`, `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\), `left` is 0**

### Explanation:
- **right**: The loop increments `right` by 1 each time until `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. Given that `right` starts at \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\) and increases by 1 each iteration, after the loop terminates, `right` will be the smallest value greater than \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. From the provided outputs, it is clear that `right` will eventually reach \(5 \times (m + 1)\) because the loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
- **result**: The problem statement mentions that `result` is an empty list, and there is no indication within the loop that `result` changes. Therefore, `result` remains an empty list.
- **zeroes**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so its value remains as it was initialized.
- **low, high, mid, left**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
