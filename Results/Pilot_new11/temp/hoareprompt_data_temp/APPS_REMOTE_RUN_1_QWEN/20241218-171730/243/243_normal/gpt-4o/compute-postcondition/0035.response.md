`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The function `func_1` is called with `mid` as an argument, but since the function itself is not defined in the snippet, we cannot determine its exact output. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
