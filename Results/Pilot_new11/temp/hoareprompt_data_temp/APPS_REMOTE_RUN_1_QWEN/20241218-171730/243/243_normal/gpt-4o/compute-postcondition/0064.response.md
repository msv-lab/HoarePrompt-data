The code initializes an empty list named `result`. None of the variables `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `zeroes` are modified. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
