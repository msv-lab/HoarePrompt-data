Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Program State:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
- `left` is `mid - k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `right` is `mid + 1`.
- `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m`.

2. **Current State**:
   - We know that `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.
   - `right` is `mid + 1`.

3. **Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to proceed, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.
   - Since `right` is `mid + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.

4. **Inference**:
   - The only way to ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m` is if `left` and `right` are positioned such that the function `func_1` evaluates to `m` for both `left` and `right`.
   - However, since `right` is `mid + 1` and we need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m`, we need to ensure that `mid + 1` is in the range where `func_1` returns `m`.

Given that `left` is `mid - k` and `right` is `mid + 1`, the current state needs to ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 1`; and `func_1(mid + 1)` must be equal to `m`.**

Note: The key adjustment needed is ensuring that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.
