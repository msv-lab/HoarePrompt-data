Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.
   - `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.
   - `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
   - `right` is now `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while func_1(right) == m:
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `right` is `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `right` remains such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Given the current state, the only state that needs adjustment is `right`, which must remain `mid + 3` so that `func_1(right)` still equals `m`.

4. **Adjusted State:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.
   - `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`.
   - `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
   - `right` is now `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.

Since `right` must remain `mid + 3` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure this condition holds true.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`, `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `right` must be `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`**.
