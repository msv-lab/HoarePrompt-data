The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `right` was previously `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` was equal to `m`. After incrementing `right`, its new value will be `mid + 4`.

- The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `mid` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `func_1(mid + 1)` remains equal to `m` because the function call itself does not change.
- The value of `left` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m` because the function call itself does not change.
- The value of `right` changes from `mid + 3` to `mid + 4`.
- `func_1(right)` is now equal to `func_1(mid + 4)`, which is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) but must be incremented by 1 to ensure `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`; `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + 4` and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.**
