The code assigns the value of `mid + 1` to `right`. The previous value of `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, the new value of `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is 0; `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\)**
