According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop condition is `low <= high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), and `result` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Given that `low` is 0, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `high` is defined as \(5 \times (m + 1)\) and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), the smallest possible value of `high` is when `m = 1`, which gives \(high = 5 \times (1 + 1) = 10\).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state because the condition `low <= high` is always satisfied given the definitions of `low` and `high`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list**
