`right` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\). The function `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`, and `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`, `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1`.**
