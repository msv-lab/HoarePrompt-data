Postcondition: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison between `zeroes` and `m`. If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`. If `zeroes > m`, then `high` is set to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes == m`, then `left` is set to `mid - k` and `right` is set to `mid + k + 1`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
