Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the provided program state step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
  - `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\).
  - `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`.
  - `left` is equal to `mid - 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `left = mid - 2`
   - `func_1(left) == m`

For the loop to continue to the next iteration, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must still hold true. This means that `func_1(left + 1)` should also be equal to `m`.

Given that `left = mid - 2`, we need to ensure that `left + 1` (which is `mid - 1`) satisfies the condition `func_1(mid - 1) == m`.

### Required Adjustments:
- The current value of `left` is `mid - 2`.
- For the loop to continue, `func_1(mid - 1)` must be equal to `m`.

Since `left` will be updated to `mid - 1` in the next iteration, we need to ensure that `mid - 1` is correctly set up for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `m` remains within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `mid` remains \((low + high) // 2\).
- `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`.
- `left` must be adjusted to `mid - 1` such that `func_1(mid - 1) == m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`, and `left` must be equal to `mid - 1` with `func_1(mid - 1) == m`**.

This ensures that the loop condition will still be satisfied in the next iteration.
