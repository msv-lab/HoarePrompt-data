The code snippet updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. We know from the initial state that `mid` is calculated as \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, `high` will now be updated to \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\).

All other variables remain unchanged. The initial values and conditions of the variables are:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`
- The current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`

After updating `high`, the new value of `high` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\), and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`**
