You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `m` is zero. According to the problem description, if `m` is zero, there should be no values of `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. However, the provided code returns an empty list for `m = 0`, which does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input is `0`, the expected output should be:
```
0
```

But the current implementation will return:
```
[]
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program is not fully compliant with the problem description for the case when `m = 0`. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the value of n in n!, and the function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` must be at least the final value of `power_of_5`, `count` is the sum of `n // power_of_5` for each iteration of the loop, `power_of_5` is the final value after all iterations (which will be 5 times its initial value raised to the power of the number of iterations)
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the sum of n // power_of_5 for each iteration of the loop

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are defined such that `func_1(left) == m` and `func_1(right) == m`, and `mid` is the final value of `mid` when `func_1(mid) == m`. If no such `mid` exists, `result` remains an empty list.
    return result
    #`The program returns an empty list 'result' since no such 'mid' exists where func_1(mid) == m`



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
