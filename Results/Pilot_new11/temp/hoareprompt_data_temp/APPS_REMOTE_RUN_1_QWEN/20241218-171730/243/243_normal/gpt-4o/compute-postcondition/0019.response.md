The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 2\). After decrementing, the new value of `left` will be \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 3\).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 3\); `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`.**
