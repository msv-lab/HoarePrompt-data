The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` was `mid + 1`. After incrementing, `right` becomes `mid + 2`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `left`, and the function call) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 2`; and `func_1(mid + 1)` must be equal to `m`.**
