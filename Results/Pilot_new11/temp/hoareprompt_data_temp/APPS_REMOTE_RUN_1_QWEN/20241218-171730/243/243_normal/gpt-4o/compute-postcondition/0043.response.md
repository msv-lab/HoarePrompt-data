`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` was `mid - 1`, so after decrementing, `left` becomes `mid - 2`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, and `func_1(left)`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - 2`; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - 2`; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.**
