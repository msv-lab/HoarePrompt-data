The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Given that `right` was initially set to `mid + 3` and must satisfy the condition `func_1(right) == m`, the new value of `right` is now `mid + 4`. 

The other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `left`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k`; `right` is `mid + 4` and must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`; `right` is incremented by 1.**
