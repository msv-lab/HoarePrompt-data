The code initializes an empty list named `result`. None of the existing variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`) are directly affected by this line of code. The only change is the creation of the `result` list.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list**
