The code `' '.join(map(str, ans))` does not change the values of `n` or `ans`. It simply joins the elements of `ans` into a single string with each element separated by a space and prints it. Since the initial state of `ans` is a list with 5 elements and the output of the print statement is 5, the elements of `ans` are not specified in detail, but we know the list has 5 elements.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `ans` is a list with 5 elements**
