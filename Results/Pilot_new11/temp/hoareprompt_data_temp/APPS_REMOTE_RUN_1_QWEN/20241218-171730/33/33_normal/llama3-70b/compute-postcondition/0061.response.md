The code prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is 90 and prints 'NO' otherwise. The value of `curr_lat` is checked against 90, and the output is determined based on this condition. The variables `n`, `dir_f`, and the output are not directly affected by this code.

- If `curr_lat` is 90, the output will be 'YES'.
- If `curr_lat` is not 90, the output will be 'NO'.

Therefore, the only variable whose value changes is the output. The other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output is 'YES' if `curr_lat` is 90 and 'NO' otherwise, and the final direction `dir_f` is the last direction received.**
