Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition for moving from the North Pole. Specifically, if Limak is at the North Pole (position 0), the program allows him to move South, which is invalid. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
20000 South
1000 North
10000 North
```

In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole (position 0). The first instruction moves him 20000 kilometers South, placing him at the South Pole (position 20000). The second instruction moves him 1000 kilometers North, placing him at 19000 kilometers from the North Pole. The third instruction moves him 10000 kilometers North, which places him back at the North Pole (position 0). However, the program incorrectly allows the move from the North Pole to the South Pole in the first step.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that if Limak is at the North Pole (position 0), he cannot move South. Similarly, if he is at the South Pole (position 20000), he cannot move North.
