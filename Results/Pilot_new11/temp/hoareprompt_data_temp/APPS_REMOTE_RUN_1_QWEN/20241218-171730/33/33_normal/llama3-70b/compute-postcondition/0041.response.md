The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that none of the variables will be updated or their values changed by the code snippet provided. The conditions and values specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'. If `curr_lat` equals -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the function does nothing.**
