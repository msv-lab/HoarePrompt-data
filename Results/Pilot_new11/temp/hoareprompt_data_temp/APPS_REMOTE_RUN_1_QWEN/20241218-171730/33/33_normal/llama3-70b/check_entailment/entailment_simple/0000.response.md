Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Movement Validation**:
   - The program checks the current latitude (`curr_lat`) and updates it based on the movement directions. However, it does not enforce the restriction that if Limak is on the North Pole (latitude = 90), he can only move South, and if he is on the South Pole (latitude = -90), he can only move North.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     3
     10000 North
     10000 South
     10000 West
     ```
     The program would allow this sequence of movements, even though it violates the rule that once Limak reaches the South Pole, he can only move North.

2. **Final Position Check**:
   - The program checks if the final position is exactly 90 (North Pole) to determine if the journey ends correctly. However, it should also ensure that Limak cannot reach beyond the South Pole (-90).
   - For instance, the input:
     ```
     3
     10000 North
     20000 South
     10000 North
     ```
     should result in the journey ending at the South Pole, which the program incorrectly allows.

3. **Handling Directions**:
   - The program uses a fixed conversion factor (`111.195`) to convert distances into degrees of latitude, which is unnecessary for the given problem. The problem specifies that the length of any meridian is 40,000 km, and thus moving 20,000 km South or North will bring Limak to the poles.
   - Instead, the program should directly use the distance limits and check the directions more strictly.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Ensure that movements respect the constraints of the poles.
- Ensure that the final position is the North Pole.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if curr_lat + t <= 90:
                curr_lat += t
            else:
                print('NO')
                return
        elif dir == 'South':
            if curr_lat - t >= -90:
                curr_lat -= t
            else:
                print('NO')
                return
        else:
            continue
    
    if curr_lat == 90:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This version ensures that the movements respect the pole constraints and correctly checks if the final position is the North Pole.
