`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by a space. The input is expected to provide two values separated by a space, which will be assigned to `t` and `dir` respectively. The values of the other variables (`n`, `position`, and `valid`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the first input value from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is True.**
