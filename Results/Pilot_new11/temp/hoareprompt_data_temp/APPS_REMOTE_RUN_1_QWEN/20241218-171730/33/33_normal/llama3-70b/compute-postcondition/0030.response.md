The code updates the value of `curr_lat` by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its current value. The value of `n`, the output string, and the direction `dir` remain unchanged. Since `t` is an integer, `t / 111.195` will be a floating-point number. The new value of `curr_lat` will be `curr_lat - t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is `-90 - t / 111.195`, the output is 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'; `t` is an integer**
