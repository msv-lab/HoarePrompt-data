Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks the movement constraints and ensures that Limak starts and ends his journey at the North Pole. The code processes each movement and updates the current latitude accordingly. If at any point the latitude goes out of the valid range (-90 to 90 degrees), or if the final latitude is not exactly 90 and the last movement was not North, or if the final latitude is exactly -90 and the last movement was not South, the code outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES". The code handles all potential cases as required by the problem description.
