The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without further executing any code. This means that no changes are made to any variables. The preconditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` becomes 90 + t / 111.195. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` becomes 90 - t / 111.195. The values of `t` and `dir` remain unchanged. The current value of `curr_lat` is out of the range [-90, 90] and no new values are assigned.**
