Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to `n`, `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to `n`, `position` is a non-negative integer within the range [0, 20000] or 0 if the loop did not execute, and `valid` is `True` if the loop did not terminate due to invalid movements, otherwise `valid` is `False`.**
