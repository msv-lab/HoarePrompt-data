The code `position = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `position`. This updates the value of `position` without affecting the values of `n`, `t_i`, or `dir_i`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to n; `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to n; `position` is 0**
