Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is updated to `position - t` and `valid` remains unchanged unless `position - t < 0` in which case `valid` is False. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t` and `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` is set to either 0 or 20000, and `valid` is set to `False`. If `dir` does not match 'North', 'South', 'West', or 'East', the original conditions for `position` and `valid` remain unchanged. The current value of `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000.***
