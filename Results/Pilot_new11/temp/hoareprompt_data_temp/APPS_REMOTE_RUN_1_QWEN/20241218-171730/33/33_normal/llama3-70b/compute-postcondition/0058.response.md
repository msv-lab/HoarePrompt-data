The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the program is terminated, no further operations can be performed, and all variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` remains within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', `dir` is the second part of the input string, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `curr_lat` is exactly -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the output remains 'NO'. If `curr_lat` is outside the range of -90 to 90, the program does nothing since the if condition ensures this case is handled only when `curr_lat` is already out of the valid range. The program has been terminated.**
