Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is `False`.***

Explanation: The if condition checks if `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000. Since the precondition already ensures that `position` is within the range [0, 20000], this condition will never be true. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with `valid` being `False` regardless of the if or else part since there is no other modification to `valid` within the given conditions.
