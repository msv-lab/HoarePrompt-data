`position` is incremented by `t`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` remains `False` if `position + t > 20000`; otherwise, `valid` remains `True`.

After executing `position += t`, the new value of `position` will be `position + t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000] and now equals `position + t`, and `valid` remains `False` if `(position + t) > 20000`; otherwise, `valid` remains `True`.**
