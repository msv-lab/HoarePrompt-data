The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output is 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'.**
