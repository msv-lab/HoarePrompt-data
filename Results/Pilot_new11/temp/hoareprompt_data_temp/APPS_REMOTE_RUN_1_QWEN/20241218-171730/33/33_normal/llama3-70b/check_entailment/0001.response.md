Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that if Limak is on the South Pole, he can only move North. Specifically, the program does not enforce this rule properly. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
10000 South
10000 North
10000 South
```

In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole, moves 10000 km South to the South Pole, then moves 10000 km North back to the North Pole, and finally moves 10000 km South again. According to the problem description, after reaching the South Pole, Limak should only be able to move North, but the current implementation allows him to move South again, which violates the condition.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that once Limak reaches the South Pole, all subsequent movements must be towards the North until he returns to the North Pole.
