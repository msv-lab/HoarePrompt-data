The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is not 'South'**
