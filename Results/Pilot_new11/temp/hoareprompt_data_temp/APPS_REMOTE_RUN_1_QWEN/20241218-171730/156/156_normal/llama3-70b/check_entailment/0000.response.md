Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining Lara's current position after she has moved `k` times. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement**: Lara starts at (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1).
2. **Snake Fashion Movement**: After reaching (n, 1), she starts moving in a snake-like pattern to the right, up, to the left, and so on, until she reaches (1, 2).

The program uses the following steps to determine the current position:
- Calculate `k % (n * 2 - 2)` to handle the repeating pattern.
- Depending on the value of `k`, it determines the row and column of Lara's current position.

Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

### Example 1: Input
```
4 3 0
```
- `k = 0`: Lara hasn't moved yet, so she is still at (1, 1).
- Output: `1 1` (Correct)

### Example 2: Input
```
4 3 11
```
- `k = 11`: After 11 moves, Lara's position follows the snake pattern.
- The movement sequence would be: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1).
- Output: `1 2` (Correct)

### Example 3: Input
```
4 3 7
```
- `k = 7`: After 7 moves, Lara's position follows the snake pattern.
- The movement sequence would be: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2).
- Output: `3 2` (Correct)

Since the program handles all described cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
