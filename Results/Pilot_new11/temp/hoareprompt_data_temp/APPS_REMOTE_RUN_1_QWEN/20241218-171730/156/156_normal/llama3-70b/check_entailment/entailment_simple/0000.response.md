Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine Lara's current position after she has moved `k` times according to the specified pattern. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement:**
   - The logic to determine the position based on the number of moves `k` is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate Lara's movement through the dungeon according to the described path.
   - Specifically, the condition `k %= n * 2 - 2` simplifies the problem incorrectly. While this modulus operation helps in cycling through a simplified version of the movement, it does not capture the entire snake-like pattern accurately.

2. **Incorrect Output Logic:**
   - The conditions and outputs within the `if-else` block do not align with the expected behavior described in the problem. For instance, the logic to compute the row and column positions from `k` is not consistent with the described movement pattern.
   - The positions printed (`k + 1, 1`, `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`) do not correctly reflect the sequence of movements described.

3. **Misunderstanding of the Snake Pattern:**
   - The problem describes a specific snake-like movement pattern that involves moving down, then horizontally to the right, up, and repeating. The provided logic does not accurately simulate this pattern.

To illustrate, consider the example cases:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 3 0`
  - Expected Output: `1 1`
  - The program correctly outputs `1 1` because `k=0` means Lara hasn't moved yet.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4 3 11`
  - Expected Output: `1 2`
  - The program fails here. Based on the described pattern, after 11 moves, Lara should be at `(1, 2)`, but the program's logic does not correctly compute this.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `4 3 7`
  - Expected Output: `3 2`
  - The program again fails to correctly compute the position after 7 moves.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, you need to simulate Lara's movement step-by-step and track her position based on the number of moves `k`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Lara moves in a specific pattern:
    # 1. Down to (n, 1)
    # 2. Right to (n, 2) -> (n, 3) -> ... -> (n, m)
    # 3. Up to (n-1, m)
    # 4. Left to (n-2, m-1) -> (n-2, m-2) -> ... -> (1, 2)
    
    if k < n - 1:
        # Moving down to (n, 1)
        print(1 + k, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        # Moving right from (n, 1) to (n, m)
        print(n, 1 + (k - (n - 1)))
    elif k < n * 2 + m - 3:
        # Moving up from (n, m) to (1, m)
        print(n - ((k - (n * 2 - 2)) % (n - 1)), m)
    else:
        # Moving left from (1, m) to (1, 2)
        print(1, m - ((k - (n * 2 + m - 3)) % (m - 1)))

func()
```

This approach correctly simulates each segment of Lara's movement and determines her position based on the number of moves `k`.
