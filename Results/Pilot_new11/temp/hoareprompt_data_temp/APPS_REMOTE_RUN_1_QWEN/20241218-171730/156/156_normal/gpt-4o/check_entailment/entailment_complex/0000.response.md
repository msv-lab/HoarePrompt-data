Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Initial Conditions and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It validates that \( n \) is even and \( m \) is odd, and that \( 0 \leq k < n \cdot m \).

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The program handles two distinct cases:
     - If \( k < n - 1 \), Lara is still moving vertically down the first column. Therefore, the position is \((k + 1, 1)\).
     - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Lara has moved to the first column and started moving horizontally and vertically in a snake pattern.
       - It subtracts \( n - 1 \) from \( k \) to account for the initial vertical movement.
       - It calculates how many complete "rows" (of width \( m - 1 \)) have been traversed using integer division.
       - It determines the remaining steps within the current row using modulo operation.
       - Depending on whether the number of full rows traversed is even or odd, it adjusts the row and column accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k \) is exactly \( n - 1 \). In this case, Lara is at the bottom-left corner, and the next step would be to move right to \((1, 2)\), which aligns with the problem description.

4. **General Logic:**
   - The logic ensures that the program correctly tracks Lara's position after \( k \) moves, following the described path.
   - The calculations for row and column positions are consistent with the problem description, ensuring that the final position matches the expected behavior.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, making it correct.
