Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario when `k` is exactly `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, after reaching the end of the snake-like movement pattern, Lara should be in cell (1, 2). However, the program does not explicitly handle this case, leading to incorrect outputs for certain values of `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3 13
```
Based on the problem description, after 13 moves, Lara should be in cell (1, 2). However, the program will incorrectly output the position due to the missing handling of the exact `n * 2 - 2` case.
