The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (an odd positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)). It returns a pair of integers representing the row and column indices. Specifically, if \(k < n - 1\), it prints `k + 1 1`. Otherwise, it calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on the value of `k` and computes the row and column indices. If `full_rows` is even, the column index is \(2 + (k \% (m - 1))\); if `full_rows` is odd, the column index is \(m - (k \% (m - 1))\). The row index is determined as \(n - full_rows\). The function covers all possible values of `k` within its defined range, including edge cases where `k` is very close to \(n \cdot m\).
