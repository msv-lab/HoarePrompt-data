Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when `k` is exactly equal to `n * m - 1`. According to the problem description, Lara moves in a specific pattern, and when she reaches the last cell (1, 2), she stops. However, the code does not account for this scenario properly.

Let's analyze the given code and the problem description:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case handling works correctly for `k < n - 1`, printing the position as `(k + 1, 1)`.

2. **General Case Handling**: For `k >= n - 1`, the code correctly reduces `k` by `n - 1` and then calculates the number of full rows (`full_rows`) and remaining steps (`remaining_steps`). However, it fails to handle the case when `k` is exactly `n * m - 1`.

   - When `k = n * m - 1`, Lara should be in the last cell `(1, 2)`.
   - The code calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` but does not correctly handle the final step where `k` is exactly `n * m - 1`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when `k` is exactly `n * m - 1`, the code correctly prints `(1, 2)`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))

if k < n - 1:
    print(k + 1, 1)
else:
    k -= n - 1
    full_rows = k // (m - 1)
    remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
    
    if full_rows % 2 == 0:
        row = n - full_rows
        col = 2 + remaining_steps
    else:
        row = n - full_rows
        col = m - remaining_steps
    
    # Handle the special case where k is exactly n * m - 1
    if k == n * m - 1:
        print(1, 2)
    else:
        print(row, col)
```

This corrected code ensures that the program handles the case when `k` is exactly `n * m - 1` and prints the correct position `(1, 2)`.
