You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining Lara's current position after she has moved `k` times. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement**: Lara starts at (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1).
2. **Snake Fashion Movement**: After reaching (n, 1), she starts moving in a snake-like pattern to the right, up, to the left, and so on, until she reaches (1, 2).

The program uses the following steps to determine the current position:
- Calculate `k % (n * 2 - 2)` to handle the repeating pattern.
- Depending on the value of `k`, it determines the row and column of Lara's current position.

Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

### Example 1: Input
```
4 3 0
```
- `k = 0`: Lara hasn't moved yet, so she is still at (1, 1).
- Output: `1 1` (Correct)

### Example 2: Input
```
4 3 11
```
- `k = 11`: After 11 moves, Lara's position follows the snake pattern.
- The movement sequence would be: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1).
- Output: `1 2` (Correct)

### Example 3: Input
```
4 3 7
```
- `k = 7`: After 7 moves, Lara's position follows the snake pattern.
- The movement sequence would be: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2).
- Output: `3 2` (Correct)

Since the program handles all described cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes three input integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are even and positive integers within the range \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( k \) is an integer within the range \( 0 \leq k < n \cdot m \). It calculates and prints coordinates based on the value of \( k \).

Specifically, the function first reduces \( k \) modulo \( n \cdot 2 - 2 \). Then, depending on the value of \( k \):

- If \( k < n - 1 \), it prints \( (k + 1, 1) \).
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \) and \( k < n \cdot 2 - 2 \), it calculates the row and column indices as follows:
  - Row index: \( 2n - k - 2 \)
  - Column index: \( \left(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1}\right) + 1 \)
  - It prints the calculated row and column indices.
- If \( k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2 \), it prints \( (1, 2) \).

This process ensures that the function handles all possible values of \( k \) and provides appropriate output coordinates based on the given conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
