The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` to `p[x] - 1`. Given the initial state where `visited[x]` is `True`, `cycle` contains `x` and `x`, and `x` is `p[x] - 1`, the value of `x` will be updated to `p[x] - 1`.

Since the initial value of `x` is already `p[x] - 1`, the assignment does not change the value of `x`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x` and `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
