The code `cycle = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `cycle`. This operation clears the previous value of `cycle`, which was a list containing all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is the last node in the cycle, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to True, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
