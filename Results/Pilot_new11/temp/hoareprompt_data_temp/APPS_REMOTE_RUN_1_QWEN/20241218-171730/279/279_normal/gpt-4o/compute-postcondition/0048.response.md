`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` is 2, `visited[2]` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[0]` is True, `visited[2]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 2, `x` is the last node in the cycle, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to False, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
