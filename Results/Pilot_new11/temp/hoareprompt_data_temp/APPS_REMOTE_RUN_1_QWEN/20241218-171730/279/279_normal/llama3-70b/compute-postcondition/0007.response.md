Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0. The condition of the if statement ensures that if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` remains 1 and `i` is set to 2. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
