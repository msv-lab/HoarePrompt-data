The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, `x` is appended to the empty list `cycle`, making it `[x]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is `True`, and `cycle` is `[x]`**
