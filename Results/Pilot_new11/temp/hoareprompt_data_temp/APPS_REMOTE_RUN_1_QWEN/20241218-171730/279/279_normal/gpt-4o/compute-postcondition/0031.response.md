`cycle` is appended with the value of `x`. The value of `x` is 1, so `cycle` now contains the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value 1, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value 1, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.**
