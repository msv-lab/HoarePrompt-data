Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `i` is the last integer checked in the dictionary, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or the second integer `i` such that `d[i] == n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `d`.
- If `d[i]` equals `n // 2` and `c` is 0, `a1` is set to `i` and `c` is incremented by 1.
- If `d[i]` equals `n // 2` and `c` is 1, `a2` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the last key in `d` that was checked, `c` will be either 0 (if no keys matched), 1 (if one key matched), or 2 (if two keys matched). 
- `a1` will be set to the first matching key if `c` is 1, otherwise it remains -1. 
- `a2` will be set to the second matching key if `c` is 2, otherwise it remains -1.
