Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of distinct numbers allows both players to take all cards equally. Specifically, the program checks if there exists a number `i` that appears exactly `n/2` times and sets `a1` and `a2` accordingly. However, this approach is incomplete and fails in cases where no such pair exists.

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, there is no way to split the cards equally between Petya and Vasya, but the program incorrectly outputs "YES" with the numbers 1 and 2. This is because the program does not properly check if splitting the cards based on the chosen numbers results in both players having the same number of cards.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that choosing any two distinct numbers results in both players taking an equal number of cards. The current implementation does not check this condition thoroughly.
