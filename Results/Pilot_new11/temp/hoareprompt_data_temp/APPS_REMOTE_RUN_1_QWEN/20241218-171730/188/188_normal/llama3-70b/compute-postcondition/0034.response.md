The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `d`, `n` is an integer, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `d[i]` is not equal to 0.**
