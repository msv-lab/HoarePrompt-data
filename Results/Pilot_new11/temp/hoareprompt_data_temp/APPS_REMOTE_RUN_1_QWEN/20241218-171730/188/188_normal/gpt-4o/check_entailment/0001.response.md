Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "YES" and two distinct numbers when it should print "NO" for certain inputs. 

Consider the following case:
```
Input
4
1
1
2
2
```

For this input, the program should output "NO" because there is no way for Petya and Vasya to choose distinct numbers such that they can each take exactly half of the cards. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "YES" and the numbers `2` and `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the counts of the unique numbers are exactly half of the total number of cards. The current implementation checks if the last two unique numbers have a count equal to `n // 2`, but it does not consider other possible valid combinations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    # Find all unique numbers and their counts
    unique_numbers = list(count.items())
    
    # Check if there are at least two unique numbers
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Check if any two distinct numbers have counts equal to n/2
    for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
            if unique_numbers[i][1] == n // 2 and unique_numbers[j][1] == n // 2:
                print('YES')
                print(unique_numbers[i][0], unique_numbers[j][0])
                return
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether there are two distinct numbers with counts equal to `n // 2`.
