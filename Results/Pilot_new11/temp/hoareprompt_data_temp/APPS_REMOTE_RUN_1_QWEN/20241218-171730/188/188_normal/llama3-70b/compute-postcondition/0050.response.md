Postcondition: ***`d` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either `i_old + 1` or `i_old`, and `a2` is either as it was at the end of the previous iteration or equal to the current value of `i`. Depending on the value of `c`, `c` may be set to 1, 2, or 3 in the if part. If `c` is 0, the loop or if statement ends and `a2` becomes equal to the current value of `i`.***
