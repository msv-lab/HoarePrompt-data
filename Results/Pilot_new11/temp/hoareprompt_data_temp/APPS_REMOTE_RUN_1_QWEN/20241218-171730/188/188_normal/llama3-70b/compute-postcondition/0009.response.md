The code `d = {}` creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `d`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `n`, and `total`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` containing integers entered via input(), `i` is `n`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined, `d` is an empty dictionary**
