The code `a.append(int(input()))` will append an integer entered via `input()` to the list `a`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, it will be created as an empty list before the append operation. The value of `n` being an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive and the value of `total` being undefined are unaffected by this operation.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `a` is created as an empty list and then an integer from the user input is appended to it.
- `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- `n` remains unchanged and is still an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `total` remains undefined.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer list containing one element (the integer entered via input()), `i` is 1, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined**.
