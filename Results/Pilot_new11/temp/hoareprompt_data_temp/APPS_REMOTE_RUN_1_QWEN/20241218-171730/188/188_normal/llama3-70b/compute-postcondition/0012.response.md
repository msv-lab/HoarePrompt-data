The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a` and it was already present in `d` (as per the initial state), the value associated with `i` in `d` will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `total`, and `d`) remain unchanged except for the modification in `d`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined, `d` is an empty dictionary with the key `i` having its value incremented by 1.**
