`d[i]` is assigned the value `1`. Here, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary that was updated based on the first element of `a`. The value of `total` remains undefined, and the value of `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary updated based on the first element of `a`, `total` is undefined, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive; `d[i]` is 1.**
