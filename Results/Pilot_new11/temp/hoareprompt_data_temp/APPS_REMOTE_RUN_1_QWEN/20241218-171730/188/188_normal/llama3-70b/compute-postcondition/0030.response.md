`a1` is assigned the value of `i`, which means `a1` now holds the same value as `i`. The value of `d[i]` remains unchanged because no operation directly affects `d[i]`. The variable `c` remains 0 since it is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`; `a1` is equal to `i`; `c` is 0.**
