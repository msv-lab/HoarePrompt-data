The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Based on the given output cases, the function does not provide specific return values but rather seems to process the input list. However, since no specific return values or conditions are provided, we can infer that the function might return some kind of processed result from the list, but without further details, we can only describe the input parameters.
