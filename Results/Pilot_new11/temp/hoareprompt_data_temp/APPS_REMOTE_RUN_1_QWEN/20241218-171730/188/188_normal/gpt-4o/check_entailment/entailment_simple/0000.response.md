Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of cards and a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - This matches the problem description's input requirements.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in the list of cards.
   - This ensures that the program knows how many cards each number appears on, which is crucial for determining if a fair game can be played.

3. **Checking Conditions for Fair Game**:
   - The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers in the list (`len(unique_numbers) >= 2`).
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, the program prints "NO" because Petya and Vasya cannot choose different numbers.
   - If there are two or more unique numbers, the program further checks if the frequencies of these two numbers match `n // 2`.
     - If both frequencies match `n // 2`, it means Petya and Vasya can choose these two numbers and take all cards fairly.
     - Otherwise, the program prints "NO".

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - If a fair game is possible, the program prints "YES" followed by the two chosen numbers.
   - If not, it prints "NO".

### Key Points Addressed:
- **Fairness Condition**: The program correctly identifies if there are two distinct numbers with equal frequency that together account for all cards, ensuring a fair game.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are fewer than two unique numbers or where the frequencies do not match `n // 2`, printing "NO" as required.

Given that the program follows the exact logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified conditions, the correctness of the program is **True**.
