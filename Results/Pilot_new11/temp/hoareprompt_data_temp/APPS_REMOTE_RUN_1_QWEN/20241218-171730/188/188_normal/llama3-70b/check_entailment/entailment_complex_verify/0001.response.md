Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly handles cases where no two distinct numbers appear exactly `n//2` times. Specifically, the program only checks if there exists a number that appears exactly `n//2` times and considers it valid if found, without ensuring that the other number also appears exactly `n//2` times. 

For example, in the third test case provided:
- Input:
```
6
10
20
30
20
10
20
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
10 20
```

This is because the program finds that the number 10 appears exactly 2 times (`n//2`), but it does not check if there is another distinct number that also appears exactly 2 times. As a result, the program fails to correctly identify cases where no such pair of numbers exists, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program needs to be revised to properly handle this case.
