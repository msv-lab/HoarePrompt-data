Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where `n` or `k` are outside the specified range 1 to 100. According to the problem description, the function should check if `n` and `k` are within the valid range before proceeding. If either `n` or `k` is outside this range, the function should handle this case appropriately. Since the code does not perform this validation, it may produce incorrect results or unexpected behavior for inputs outside the specified range. Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
