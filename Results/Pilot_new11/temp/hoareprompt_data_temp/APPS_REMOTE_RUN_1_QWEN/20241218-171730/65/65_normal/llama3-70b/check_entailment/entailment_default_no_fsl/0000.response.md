Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not validate whether `n` and `k` are within the specified range of 1 to 100. According to the problem description, the values of `n` and `k` must be in this range, and if they are not, the program should not proceed without proper validation. This missing validation can lead to incorrect behavior or errors when invalid inputs are provided. For example, if `n` or `k` is 0 or greater than 100, the program may produce incorrect results or behave unpredictably. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
