You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether Kefa can distribute all the balloons such that no friend gets more than one balloon of the same color. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of balloons `n` and friends `k`, followed by the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
2. **Color Counting**: It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`.
3. **Distribution Check**: It iterates through the values in the dictionary to check if any color appears more times than the number of friends `k`. If so, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` and breaks the loop.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints 'YES' if all colors can be distributed without any friend getting more than one balloon of the same color, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It ensures that if any color appears more times than the number of friends, the distribution is deemed impossible. This covers all the requirements and constraints mentioned in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters \( n \) and \( k \), both of which are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 100 \), and a string \( s \) consisting of lowercase letters. It counts the frequency of each color (character) in the string \( s \). Then, it checks if the frequency of any color exceeds \( k \). If no color frequency exceeds \( k \), it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to distribute the balloons according to the given conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to do so. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values for \( n \) and \( k \) or characters other than lowercase letters in \( s \)), which are handled by the input processing part of the code. However, the function does not explicitly handle these edge cases in its logic; it assumes valid inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
