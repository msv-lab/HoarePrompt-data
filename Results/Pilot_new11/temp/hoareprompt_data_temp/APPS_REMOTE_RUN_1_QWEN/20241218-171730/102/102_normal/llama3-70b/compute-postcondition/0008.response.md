The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. It does not affect any variables but signifies the end of the program execution. Therefore, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `x` and `b` are unspecified, and the current value of `n` satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b == n; 'YES' has been printed.**
