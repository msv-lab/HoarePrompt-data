The code `a = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was input before and is not affected by this operation. The value of `b` also remains within its original range [1, 10 000 000].

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000**
