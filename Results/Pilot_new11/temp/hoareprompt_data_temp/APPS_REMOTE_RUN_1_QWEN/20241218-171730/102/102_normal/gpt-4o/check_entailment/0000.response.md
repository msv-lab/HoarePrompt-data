Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to spend exactly `n` burles by buying some number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The program iterates over possible values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) from `0` to `n // a`.
2. For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount of money (`n - x * a`) is divisible by `b` using `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.
3. If such a `y` (the number of Bars bars) is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and returns, which satisfies the requirement to output `x` and `y` if possible.
4. If no such `y` is found after checking all possible values of `x`, the program prints "NO", indicating it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

The program handles the constraints and logic correctly, ensuring it works for all valid inputs as per the problem statement. Thus, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
