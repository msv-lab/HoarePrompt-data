To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step.

### Given Information
- The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `x` is \(x + 1\)
  - `y` is \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\)
  - If the condition \(x * a + y * b == n\) holds, then `x` and `y` remain unchanged; otherwise, no change occurs to `x` and `y`.

### Loop Statement
```
for x in range(n // a + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Range of `x`:**
   - The loop runs for values of `x` from 0 to \(n // a\).
   - This means the loop variable `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 up to \(n // a\).

2. **Initial State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is \(x + 1\).
   - `y` is calculated as \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\).

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If \(x * a + y * b == n\), then both `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
   - If the condition does not hold, then `x` and `y` do not change.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since `x` was \(x + 1\) at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `x` for the next iteration will be \(x + 2\).

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - `x` will be \(x + 2\).
   - `y` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the condition did not hold or it was unchanged.

### Conclusion
State at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` is \(x + 2\)
- `y` is \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\) (unchanged from the previous iteration)

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`x` is \(x + 2\), `y` is \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\)**.
