Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input Values**: 
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input, as specified in the problem description.
   
2. **Iterative Search**:
   - The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over possible values of `x` in the range `0` to `n // a + 1`.
   - For each value of `x`, it checks if `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. This condition ensures that the remaining amount of money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola can be exactly spent on Bars bars.
   - If the condition is met, it calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b` and prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and then returns.

3. **Handling Non-Solvable Cases**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any valid pair `(x, y)`, the program prints 'NO' and returns.

### Key Points That Ensure Correctness:
- **Range of Iteration**: The loop iterates up to `n // a + 1` to ensure that all possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) are checked.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0` ensures that the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of Bars bars, making sure that `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars can be bought to spend exactly `n` burles.
- **Return Mechanism**: The program returns immediately once it finds a valid solution, ensuring that it does not perform unnecessary iterations.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
