According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `x`. The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:

- `y` is \((n - x * a) // b\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `x` and `b` are unspecified, but the condition `x * a + y * b == n` determines whether 'YES' is printed

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be less than `n // a + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was some value \(x_{prev}\), and `n` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the new value of `x` as \(x_{new}\). For the loop to execute again, \(x_{new}\) must be \(x_{prev} + 1\).

Since `n` does not change within the loop and remains a non-negative integer, the only variable that needs to be updated is `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`y` is \((n - (x_{prev} + 1) * a) // b\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `x` is \(x_{prev} + 1\), and `b` is unspecified**.

Given the specific values from the previous iteration were not provided, we can express it more generally as:

State: **`y` is \((n - x * a) // b\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `x` is \(x + 1\), and `b` is unspecified**.
