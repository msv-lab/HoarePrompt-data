The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value obtained from user input to the variable `n`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `1 <= n, a, b <= 10 000 000` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000**
