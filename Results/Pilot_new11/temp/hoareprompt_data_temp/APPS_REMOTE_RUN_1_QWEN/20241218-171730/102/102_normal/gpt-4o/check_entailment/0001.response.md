Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is not divisible by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is a critical edge case that needs to be considered for the solution to be correct.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
15
4
8
```

According to the problem description, it should output:
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output:
```
YES
3 0
```

This happens because the loop checks for any combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`, without verifying if such a combination exists. To fix this, we need to check if `n` is divisible by the GCD of `a` and `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Calculate the GCD of a and b
    gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)

    # Check if n is divisible by the GCD of a and b
    if n % gcd_ab == 0:
        print('YES')
        # Calculate the coefficients
        x = n // a
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        print(x, y)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify when it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles with the given prices of Ber-Cola and Bars bars.
