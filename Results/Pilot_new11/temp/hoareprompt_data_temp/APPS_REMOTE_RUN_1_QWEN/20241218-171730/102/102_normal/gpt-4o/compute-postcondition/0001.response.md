The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value obtained from `input()` to the variable `a`. Since the initial value of `n` was obtained from `input()`, the new value of `a` will be the same as the value of `n` from the initial state. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000**
