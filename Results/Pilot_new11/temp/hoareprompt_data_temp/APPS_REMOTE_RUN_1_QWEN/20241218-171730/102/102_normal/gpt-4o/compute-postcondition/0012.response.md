The code snippet prints 'YES'. This does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the start of the output. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `x`, and the condition involving `x_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is a variable used in the calculation, and `(n - (x_end + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0; printed text is 'YES'**
