The code updates `max_jump` with the maximum value between `max_jump` and `i - prev_pos`. However, the initial values of `max_jump` and `prev_pos` are not specified in the initial state. Since these values are not given, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_jump`. But we know that `i` is updated to the index of a vowel in the string `s`.

Given that `s[i]` is a vowel, let's assume `i` is updated to the index of this vowel (though the actual value of `i` is not specified, we know it refers to a vowel position).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `i` is the index of a vowel in `s`; `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.**
