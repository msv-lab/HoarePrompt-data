The code updates the `max_jump` variable by setting it to the maximum of its current value and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string (`n - last_vowel`) divided by 2, rounded up, plus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is the index of the last vowel encountered.
- `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered.
- `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and the distance between consecutive vowels divided by 2 rounded up plus 1.
- `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- If no vowels are present in `s`, `last_vowel` remains -1 and `max_jump` remains 0.

After executing the line `max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`:

- The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1; `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`. If no vowels are present in `s`, `last_vowel` remains -1 and `max_jump` remains 0.**
