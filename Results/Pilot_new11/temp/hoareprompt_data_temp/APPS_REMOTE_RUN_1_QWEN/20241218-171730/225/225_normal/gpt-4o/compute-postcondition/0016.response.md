To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and checks if the character is a vowel. If it is a vowel, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum value between its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and the last vowel position `prev_pos`. It then sets `prev_pos` to the current index `i`.

### Understanding the Loop Execution
- **Initial Values**: `s` is a non-empty string, `vowels` is a set of vowels, `max_jump` is 1, and `prev_pos` is -1.
- **Loop Iteration**:
  - For each iteration, `i` takes the index of the current character in `s`.
  - If `s[i]` is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `i - prev_pos`, and `prev_pos` is updated to `i`.

### Key Observations
- After the loop finishes, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel in the string `s`.
- `max_jump` will be the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the string.

### Final State
- Since the loop will eventually iterate through all characters in `s`, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel in `s`.
- `max_jump` will be the largest gap between any two consecutive vowels in the string `s`.

### Output State
- If there are no vowels in the string `s`, `max_jump` will remain 1 (its initial value) because no update is made to `max_jump` in this case.
- If there are vowels in the string `s`, `max_jump` will be the largest gap between any two consecutive vowels.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum gap between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, and `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
