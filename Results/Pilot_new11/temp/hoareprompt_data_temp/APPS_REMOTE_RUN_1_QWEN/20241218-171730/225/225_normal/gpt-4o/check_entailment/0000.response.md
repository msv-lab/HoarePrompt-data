Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string by only jumping on vowels. The logic iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump length accordingly. This ensures that the program works for all potential cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given requirements.
