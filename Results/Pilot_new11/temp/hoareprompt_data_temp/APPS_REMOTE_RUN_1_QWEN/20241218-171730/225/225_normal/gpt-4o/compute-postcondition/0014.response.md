The code `prev_pos = i` updates the value of `prev_pos` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 2`, and `prev_pos` is `i + 1`. After executing the code, `prev_pos` is updated to `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 2`, `max_jump` is `-1`, and `prev_pos` is `i`.**
