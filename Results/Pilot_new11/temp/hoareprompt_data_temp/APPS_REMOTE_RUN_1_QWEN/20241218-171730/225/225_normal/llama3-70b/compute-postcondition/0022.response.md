The code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is the index of the last found vowel in the string `s`, and `last_vowel` is set to `i + 1`. Therefore, the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` simplifies to \((i - (i + 1)) // 2 + 1 = (-1) // 2 + 1 = -1 // 2 + 1 = -0 + 1 = 1\).

Since the initial value of `max_jump` is not specified, we assume it is some value \( x \). After executing the line `max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum between its current value and 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel and `i` is the new `last_vowel`; `last_vowel` is equal to `i + 1`; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and 1.**
