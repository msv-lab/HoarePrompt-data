The code snippet updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the string `s` minus the value of `prev_pos`. Since `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, the length of `s` minus `prev_pos` represents the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s`.
- `max_jump` is the maximum gap between any two consecutive vowels in `s`.
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.

After executing the line `max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)`:
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the string `s` minus `prev_pos`.

The output state is:
**`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s`; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and the length of the string `s` minus `prev_pos`; `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
