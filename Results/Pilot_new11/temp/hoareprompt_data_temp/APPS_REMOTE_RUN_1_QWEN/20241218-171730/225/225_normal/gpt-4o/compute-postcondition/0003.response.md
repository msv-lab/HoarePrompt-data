According to the code, the loop will iterate over the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The string `s` must be non-empty, which is already given in the initial state.
2. The variable `i` must start from 0 and increment up to but not including the length of `s`.

Given that the initial state is `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100, we need to adjust the state to include the starting value of `i`, which should be 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100.
- `i` must start from 0.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100, `i` is 0**
