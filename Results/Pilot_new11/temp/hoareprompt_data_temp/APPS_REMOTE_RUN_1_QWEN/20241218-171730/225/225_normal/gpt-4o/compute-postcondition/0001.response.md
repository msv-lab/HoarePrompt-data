The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `max_jump`. This assignment does not affect the value of `s` or the content of the set `vowels`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels; `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `max_jump` is 1.**
