Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to accept a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. The function correctly processes this input without handling invalid cases (like non-string inputs or empty strings), adhering to the assumption that valid input is provided.

2. **Vowel Identification and Gap Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `vowels` as a set containing the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.
   - It then iterates through the string `s` to find the maximum gap (number of consonants) between any two consecutive vowels. 
   - The variable `max_jump` is used to keep track of the maximum gap found during the iteration.
   - The variable `prev_pos` stores the index of the last vowel encountered so far.

3. **Edge Cases and Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, the function ensures that `max_jump` includes the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string by updating `max_jump` with `len(s) - prev_pos`.
   - Finally, the function returns `max_jump`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1(s)` with the input string `s` and prints the result. Since the function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum jump ability required, the output will match the problem's requirements.

5. **Guaranteed Validity**:
   - The problem guarantees that the string length does not exceed 100, and only vowels are present in the string. The program correctly handles these constraints without any additional checks.

Given the above points, the program accurately follows the problem description and computes the required minimum jump ability correctly for any valid input string. Therefore, the program is correct.
