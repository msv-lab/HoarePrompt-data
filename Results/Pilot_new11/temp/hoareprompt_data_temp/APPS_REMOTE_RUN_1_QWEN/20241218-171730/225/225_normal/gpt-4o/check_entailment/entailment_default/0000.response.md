Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels. The function `func_1` iterates through the string and calculates the maximum gap between consecutive vowels, which represents the required jump ability. It handles edge cases such as strings with no vowels or only one vowel correctly. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
