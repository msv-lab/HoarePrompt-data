The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the string `s` is stored in `n`, and the original string `s` and the set of vowels `vowels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`.**
