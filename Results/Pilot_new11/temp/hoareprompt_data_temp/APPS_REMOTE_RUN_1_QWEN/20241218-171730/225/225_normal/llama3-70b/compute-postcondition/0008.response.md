The code updates the `max_jump` variable to be the maximum value between `max_jump` and `i + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `max_jump` is initially 0, and `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel. Therefore, `i + 1` will be greater than 0. Since `max_jump` is initialized to 0, `max_jump` will be updated to `i + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel, `max_jump` is `i + 1`, `last_vowel` is -1**
