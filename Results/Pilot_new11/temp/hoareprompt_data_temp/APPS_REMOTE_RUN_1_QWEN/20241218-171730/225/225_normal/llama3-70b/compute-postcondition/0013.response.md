Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered (set to `i` if this is the first vowel), and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `((i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)` if `last_vowel` was not -1. If `s[i]` is not a vowel, the values of `last_vowel` and `max_jump` remain unchanged.***
