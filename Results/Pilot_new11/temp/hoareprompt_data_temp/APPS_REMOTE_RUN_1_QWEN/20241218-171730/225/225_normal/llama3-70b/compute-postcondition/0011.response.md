Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel. If `last_vowel` was -1, `max_jump` is set to `i + 1` and `last_vowel` remains -1. Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `((i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, and `last_vowel` is set to `i`.***
