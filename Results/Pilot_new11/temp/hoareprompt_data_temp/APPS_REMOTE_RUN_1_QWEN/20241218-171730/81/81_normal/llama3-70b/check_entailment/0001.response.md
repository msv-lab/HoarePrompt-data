Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic to solve the problem correctly. The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implementations of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM), respectively. However, these functions alone do not address the main requirement of counting the number of good pairs `(a, b)` such that `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y` within the range `[l, r]`.

To solve this problem, we need to check if `x * y` equals `a * b` (where `a` and `b` are the factors of `x * y`) and ensure that `a` and `b` satisfy the conditions `l ≤ a, b ≤ r` and `GCD(a, b) = x`. The provided code does not include this logic.

For example, consider the input `l = 50`, `r = 100`, `x = 3`, and `y = 30`. The correct output should be `0` because there are no pairs `(a, b)` within the range `[50, 100]` such that `GCD(a, b) = 3` and `LCM(a, b) = 30`. However, the provided code does not perform the necessary checks to find such pairs, hence it will not produce the correct result for this and similar cases.
