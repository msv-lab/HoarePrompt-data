Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `y`. According to the problem description, `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`, which implies that `y` must be divisible by `x`. However, the program does not check this condition before proceeding with the calculations. This can lead to incorrect results if `y % x != 0`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 10 5 6
```
Here, `x = 5` and `y = 6`. Since `y % x != 0`, no pairs `(a, b)` can satisfy both conditions. The program should return `0` in this case, but it does not check this condition and will proceed with the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should add a check at the beginning to ensure `y % x == 0` before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
