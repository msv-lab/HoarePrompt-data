Output State: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is the sum of the valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given constraints, where `a = i * x` and `b = z // i * x` for each `i` in the range \(1 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor\).**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The initial values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `count` are given as described in the problem statement.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `\(\lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor\)` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `z % i == 0`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it calculates `a` and `b` as follows:
     - `a = i * x`
     - `b = z // i * x`
   - It then checks if both `a` and `b` lie within the range `[l, r]` and if they satisfy the GCD condition (`math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`).
   - Depending on whether `a == b` or `a != b`, it increments `count` by 1 or 2, respectively.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes executing, `count` will be the sum of all valid pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. Each valid pair `(a, b)` is counted according to the rules inside the loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
