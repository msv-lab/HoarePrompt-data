Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` from the input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Range Iteration**: The program iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the range `[l, r]` and checks each pair to see if it meets the conditions specified in the problem description using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

3. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that the GCD of the pair is equal to `x`.

4. **LCM Calculation (`func_2`)**: The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. This ensures that the LCM of the pair is equal to `y`.

5. **Counting Good Pairs**: The program increments the `count` variable whenever it finds a pair `(a, b)` that satisfies both the GCD and LCM conditions.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the count of such pairs, which is the correct output as per the problem description.

Since the program follows the logic described in the problem statement, it correctly counts the number of good pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y` within the specified range `[l, r]`. Therefore, the program is correct.
