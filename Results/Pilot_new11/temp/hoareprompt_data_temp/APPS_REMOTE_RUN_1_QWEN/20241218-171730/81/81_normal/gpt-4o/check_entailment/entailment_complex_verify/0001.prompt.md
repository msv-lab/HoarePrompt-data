You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. Here’s a brief breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and passes it to the `func_1` function.
2. **GCD and LCM Relationship**: It checks if `y % x == 0`, which is necessary for valid pairs (a, b).
3. **Range Validation**: For each factor `i` of `z = y // x`, it calculates `a` and `b` and checks if they lie within the specified range `[l, r]`.
4. **Pair Counting**: It counts both (a, b) and (b, a) as distinct pairs if `a != b`.

Given the provided test cases:
- **Example 1**: (1, 2, 1, 2) -> Output: 2 (Correct)
- **Example 2**: (1, 12, 1, 12) -> Output: 4 (Correct)
- **Example 3**: (50, 100, 3, 30) -> Output: 0 (Correct)

And considering the logic, there are no apparent edge cases or potential scenarios where the program might fail. Therefore, the program appears to handle all described cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if (y % x != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9, and y is divisible by x
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b
                ) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is the sum of the valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given constraints, where `a = i * x` and `b = z // i * x` for each `i` in the range \(1 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor\).
    return count
    #`The program returns the sum of valid pairs (a, b) where a = i * x and b = z // i * x for each i in the range 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊√z⌋, given that y is divisible by x, z = y // x, and 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, which are all integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to find pairs `(a, b)` such that \(a = i \times x\) and \(b = \frac{z}{i} \times x\) for each `i` in the range \(1 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor\), where \(z = \frac{y}{x}\), and both `a` and `b` satisfy the conditions \(l \leq a \leq r\) and \(l \leq b \leq r\). Additionally, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` must be `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD must equal `y`.

The function returns the count of such valid pairs `(a, b)`. If no valid pairs are found, the function also returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
