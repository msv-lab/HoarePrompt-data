Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code will encounter a `ZeroDivisionError` if either `a` or `b` is 0. The function `func_1` correctly handles the GCD calculation, but `func_2` does not include error handling for division by zero. When either `a` or `b` is 0, `func_1` will return 0, leading to a division by zero in `func_2`. 

For example, if `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 0`, and `y = 0`, the code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `func_1(0, b)` or `func_1(a, 0)` will return 0, and `func_2` will attempt to perform `a * b // 0`, which is undefined. Therefore, the code does not handle the case where one of the inputs is 0, leading to incorrect behavior.
