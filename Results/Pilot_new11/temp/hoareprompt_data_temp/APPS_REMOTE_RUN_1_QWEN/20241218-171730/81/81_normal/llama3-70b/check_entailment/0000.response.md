Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`, which are intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM), respectively. However, these functions are not utilized in the main logic to solve the problem, which is to count the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the range [l, r].

The problem requires using the properties of GCD and LCM to determine the number of valid pairs. Specifically, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, then \(a \cdot b = x \cdot y\). Additionally, since \(x\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), we can express \(a = dx\) and \(b = ey\), where \(d\) and \(e\) are coprime (i.e., GCD(d, e) = 1).

Given the constraints and the need to count pairs, the program should implement the logic to find such pairs, but the provided code does not do this. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the required functionality to solve the problem.
