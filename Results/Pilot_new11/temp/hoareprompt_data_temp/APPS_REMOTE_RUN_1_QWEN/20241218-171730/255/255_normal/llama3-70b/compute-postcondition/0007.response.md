Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]`.
     - If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, then `ans` is 2.

2. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `ans` is either 1 or 2 (depending on the condition mentioned above)

4. **Next Iteration Considerations:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The condition `n > 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - We need to check the value of `ans` based on the condition for `i = 2`.

5. **Condition Check for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for `ans` is based on whether `s[2]` is equal to `s[1]`.
   - If `s[2]` is not equal to `s[1]`, then `ans` will be 2.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 (since the loop needs to execute at least until `i` reaches `n-1`).
   - `ans` will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `s[2]` is equal to `s[1]`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is equal to `s[1]`. If `s[2]` is not equal to `s[1]`, then `ans` is 2.**
