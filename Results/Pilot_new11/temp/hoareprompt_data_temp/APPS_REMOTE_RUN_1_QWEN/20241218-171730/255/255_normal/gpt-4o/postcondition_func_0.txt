The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It calculates and prints the number of transitions in the string `s`, where a transition is defined as a character at index `i` (for `i` in range 1 to `n-1`) being different from the previous character `s[i-1]`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the total number of transitions found in the string `s`.
