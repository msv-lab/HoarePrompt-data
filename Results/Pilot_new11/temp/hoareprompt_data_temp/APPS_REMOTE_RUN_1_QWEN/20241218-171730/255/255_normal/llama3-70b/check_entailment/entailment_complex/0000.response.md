Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings where all characters are the same. However, the program simply counts the number of transitions between consecutive characters in the string.

To illustrate why this is incorrect:

- Consider the input `"aaaa"`. The correct answer should be 1 because we can remove the entire string in one operation (deleting the substring "aaaa").
- However, the current program would output 3, because it counts the transitions between 'a' and 'a' (three times, at positions (1,2), (2,3), and (3,4)).

The correct approach should involve a dynamic programming or stack-based solution to keep track of deletions more effectively. Here's a brief outline of how the correct solution could work:

1. Iterate through the string and use a counter to keep track of the number of operations needed.
2. Use a stack to keep track of the current sequence of characters.
3. Whenever a different character is encountered, increment the operation count if the stack is not empty, and push the new character onto the stack.
4. After processing the entire string, check if there are any remaining characters in the stack and increment the operation count if necessary.

The provided program does not implement any such logic, hence it fails to meet the problem requirements.
