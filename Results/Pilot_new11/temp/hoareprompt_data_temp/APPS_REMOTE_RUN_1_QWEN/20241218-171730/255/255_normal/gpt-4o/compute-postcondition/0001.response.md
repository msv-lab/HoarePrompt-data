`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means the value of `s` will be the string entered by the user. The length of this string is equal to the original `n`, but the content of `s` is now the string input by the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is an integer input**
