`ux` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ux` is not specified, but it is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string, op is not equal to 'U' and op is not equal to 'D', the current value of op is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, op is not equal to 'U' and op is not equal to 'D', the current value of op is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1**
