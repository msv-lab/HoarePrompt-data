Postcondition: ***`i` is 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to 2, `current_y` remains unchanged, `position_map` is updated to {(0, 0): -1, (2, current_y): 1}, and `target_pos` remains as `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if `operations[i]` is not 'R'.***
