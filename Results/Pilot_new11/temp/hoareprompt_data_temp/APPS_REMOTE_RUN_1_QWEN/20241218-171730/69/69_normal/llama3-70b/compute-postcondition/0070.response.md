Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, `op` retain their original values with the following exceptions:
- If `op` is 'D' and `dy < 0`, then `dy` is incremented by 1.
- If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1.
- If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, then `dx` is incremented by 1 and `res` remains unchanged.
- In all other cases, `dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, and `res` remain unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
