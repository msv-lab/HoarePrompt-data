`final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `final_y` is -1 if the next operation in `operations` is 'D', and 0 otherwise. Since `final_y` is incremented by 1, the new value of `final_y` will be 0 if the next operation is 'D', and 1 otherwise. The states of the other variables (`final_x`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1 or 1 depending on whether the next operation in `operations` is 'L' or 'R', respectively, `final_y` is 0 if the next operation is 'D', and 1 otherwise, `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
