The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. Given that `current_y` was part of the key in `position_map` with the value 2, updating `current_y` will affect the key in `position_map`. Since the operations and the structure of `position_map` depend on the value of `operations[1]`, we need to consider both possible structures of `position_map`.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: Initial `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}`
- The initial `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}`.
- After executing `current_y += 1`, the new `current_y` value is `new_current_y + 1`.
- The updated `position_map` will be `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y + 1): 2}`.

### Case 2: Initial `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1}`
- The initial `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1}`.
- After executing `current_y += 1`, the new `current_y` value is `new_current_y + 1`.
- The updated `position_map` will be `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y): 2}`.

Given the initial state, the value of `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`. Since `position_map[target_pos]` is either 1 or -1, `1 - position_map[target_pos]` will be either 0 or 2. Therefore, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and either 0 or 2, which means `min_length` will remain unchanged unless it was initially smaller than 2.

Since the exact value of `min_length` is not specified and does not change based on the given operations, we assume it remains as it was initially.

### Final Output State:
- `i` is 2.
- `min_length` remains unchanged.
- `current_y` is incremented by 1.
- `position_map` is updated accordingly to one of the two cases mentioned above.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` remains unchanged, `current_y` is new_current_y + 1, and `position_map` is either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y + 1): 2} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y): 2}.**
