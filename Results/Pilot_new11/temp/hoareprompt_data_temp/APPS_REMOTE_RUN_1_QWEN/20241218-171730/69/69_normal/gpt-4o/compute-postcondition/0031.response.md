The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. The initial possible values for `final_x` are -2, -1, 0, or 1. After incrementing by 1, the new possible values for `final_x` are -1, 0, 1, or 2. The values of the other variables (`final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
