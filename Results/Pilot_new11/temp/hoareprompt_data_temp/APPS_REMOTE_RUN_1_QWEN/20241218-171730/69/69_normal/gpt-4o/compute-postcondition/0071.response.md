`current_x` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains 1, and the other variables (`current_y`, `position_map`, `target_pos`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `i` is 1
- `current_x` is `1 + 1` which is 2
- `current_y` is unchanged
- `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1, (2, current_y): 1}
- `target_pos` remains `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_x` is 2, `current_y` is unchanged, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (2, current_y): 1}, `target_pos` is `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`**
