Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, `op` retain their original values in most cases. Specifically:
- If `op == 'U'` and `dy > 0`, then `dy` is set to `dy - 1`.
- If `op == 'D'` and `dy < 0`, then `dy` is incremented by 1.
- If `op == 'R'` and `dx > 0`, then `dx` is decremented by 1.
- If `op == 'L'` and `dx < 0`, then `dx` is incremented by 1 and `res` remains unchanged.
- In all other cases, `dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, and `res` remain unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
