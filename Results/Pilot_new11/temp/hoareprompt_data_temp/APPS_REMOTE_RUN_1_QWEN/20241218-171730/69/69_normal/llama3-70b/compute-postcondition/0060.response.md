Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, `op` are as defined. If the current operation `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1 and `res` is set to 0. Otherwise, `res` is set to 1.***
