Postcondition: **`final_x` is either -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Depending on the value of `op`, `final_x` is updated as follows: if `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is set to either -3, -2, -1, or 0; if `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is set to either -1, 0, 1, or 2. Otherwise, the value of `final_x` remains unchanged.**
