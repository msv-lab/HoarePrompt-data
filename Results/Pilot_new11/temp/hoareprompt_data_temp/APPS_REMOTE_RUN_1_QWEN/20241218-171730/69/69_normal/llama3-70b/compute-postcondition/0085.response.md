The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function should accept at least one parameter, which is a sequence of operations represented as a string. Additionally, it should accept two integer parameters representing the target coordinates (x, y).

Therefore, the function should be described as accepting three parameters: a string sequence of operations and two integer coordinates (x, y).

Output cases are not directly provided in the problem statement, so we focus on the parameters and their types.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `sequence` and two integers `x` and `y`.**
