`current_x` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains 2, and `min_length` is still updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`. The structure of `position_map` remains the same, including the entry for `(current_x, current_y)` with the value 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} depending on the value of `operations[1]` and now also includes {(current_x + 1, current_y): 2}, and `(current_x + 1, current_y)` is added to `position_map` with the value 2.**
