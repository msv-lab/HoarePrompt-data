`final_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_x` remains 0, and the other variables (`operations`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `op`) are not affected.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `operations` must be a non-empty string, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `op` is 'D'.**
