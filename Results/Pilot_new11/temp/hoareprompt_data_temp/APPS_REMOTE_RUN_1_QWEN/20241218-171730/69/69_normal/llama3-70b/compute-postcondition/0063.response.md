The code `dy -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `dy`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `dy - 1`, `ops` (next operation) is unchanged, `ux` is unchanged, `uy` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `op` (next operation) is unchanged**
