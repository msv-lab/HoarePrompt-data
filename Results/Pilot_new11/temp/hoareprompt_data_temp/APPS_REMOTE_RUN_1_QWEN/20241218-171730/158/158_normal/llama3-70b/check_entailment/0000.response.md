Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). The program calculates the minimum number of sets of fruits that can be used (`min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`) and then computes the total number of fruits used (`min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`). This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all potential inputs within the given constraints. Since the program handles the cases where Nikolay might not have enough apples or pears to use any lemons and returns 0 accordingly, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
