Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the ratio 1:2:4. The code reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It then determines the minimum number of sets of the ratio (i.e., the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`) and calculates the total number of fruits that can be used, which is `min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon = 7 * min_lemon`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the code handles all potential cases correctly. The output hints also confirm that the code is following the expected logic, and no edge cases or examples were found where the code does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
