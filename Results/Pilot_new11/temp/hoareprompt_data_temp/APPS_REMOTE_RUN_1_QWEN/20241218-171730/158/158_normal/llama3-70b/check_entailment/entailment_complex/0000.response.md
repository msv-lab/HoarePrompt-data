Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, which is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Value**: The program calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` using the expression `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that the number of lemons used is the limiting factor for the total number of fruits in the compote.

3. **Output Calculation**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `8 * min_lemon`. This calculation ensures that for each lemon used, there are exactly 2 apples and 4 pears, adhering to the required ratio.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where no fruits can be used (`min_lemon == 0`) by outputting `0`, which is the correct response according to the problem description.

Since the program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio, and outputs the result as specified, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
