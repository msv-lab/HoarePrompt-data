Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). The program uses the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to determine how many sets of the required ratio can be formed, and then calculates the total number of fruits accordingly. This approach ensures that the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the examples provided also confirm its correctness.
