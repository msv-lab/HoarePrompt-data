The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `b`. The variable `a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, and `c` is a non-negative integer. After executing the code, the value of `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated to the integer input from the user.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is a non-negative integer**
