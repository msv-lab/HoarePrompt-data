The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parameter list. The functionality of the function involves processing integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which are constrained such that `1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000`. However, since these parameters are not passed to the function, we need to consider the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Given the output cases, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation using `a`, `b`, and `c`, but since they are not provided as parameters, we can only describe the expected behavior in terms of return values based on the conditions provided.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- The function does not accept any parameters.
- The function may internally use values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these values are not provided as function arguments.
- Based on the output cases, the function likely returns different values depending on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the exact internal logic is not provided, we can only describe the possible return values based on the constraints and output cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the internal processing of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000).**
