The code assigns the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to `min_lemon`. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected, and only `c` is used in the calculation, so `c` remains unchanged.

- `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is the integer input converted to an integer.
- `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the integer input converted to an integer; `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
