Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be used to maintain the required ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used by taking the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. This ensures that the fruits are used in the correct ratio without breaking any of them. The program then calculates the total number of fruits used and prints it. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
