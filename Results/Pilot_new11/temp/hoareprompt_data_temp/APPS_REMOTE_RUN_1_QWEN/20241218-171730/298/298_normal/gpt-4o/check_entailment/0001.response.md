Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is odd and `area` is a non-integer. Specifically, when `n` or `m` is odd, the calculated area might not be achievable with integer coordinates. For example, consider the input `3 4 5`. The required area is \( \frac{3 \times 4}{5} = 2.4 \), which is not an integer, but the program will still attempt to find integer coordinates, leading to an incorrect solution. This can be seen as a potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements.
