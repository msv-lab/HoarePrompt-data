The code snippet `print(f'1 0')` does not change any variable values. It simply prints the string `1 0`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, the console prints '1 0', and the conditions `2 * area <= m` and `2 * area > n` hold true.**
