Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases and does not guarantee that the area of the triangle formed by the points will always be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Here are a few issues and potential counterexamples:

1. **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The code correctly checks if \(\text{area} = \frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer. However, it does not ensure that the chosen points will always form a triangle with the required area. For example, if \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\), and \(k = 5\), the area should be \(\frac{4}{5}\), which is not an integer, so the program prints "NO". This part is correct.

2. **Case When Area is Zero**: The code correctly handles the case when \(\text{area} = 0\) and prints "NO". However, it does not handle the case when the area is a non-zero integer but cannot be achieved with the given constraints. For example, if \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\), and \(k = 3\), the area should be 2, but the chosen points \((0,0)\), \((2,1)\), and \((0,1)\) do not form a triangle with area 2. Instead, they form a degenerate triangle with area 0. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Choosing Points**: The code chooses points based on the condition \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\) or \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\). However, it does not always ensure that the area of the triangle is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For example, if \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 4\), the area should be \(\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\). The code would choose \((0, 0)\), \((4, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\), but these points do not form a triangle with the required area. A correct solution would be \((0, 0)\), \((3, 2)\), and \((1, 1)\), which forms a triangle with area \(\frac{9}{4}\).

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee that it will always find a set of points forming a triangle with the required area for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
