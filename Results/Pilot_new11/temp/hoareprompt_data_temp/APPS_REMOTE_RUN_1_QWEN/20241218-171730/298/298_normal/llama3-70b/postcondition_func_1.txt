The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with \(b \neq 0\)) and implements a recursive version of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the values `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are the results of the recursive call. This process continues until `b` becomes zero.
