The code assigns the value of `n * m / k` to the variable `area`. This means `area` is calculated using the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`**
