Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only includes three helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD), Bezout's coefficients, and a linear combination of two numbers. However, these functions do not address the main problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area.

To solve the problem, we need to ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Given that the area needs to be \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need to find suitable \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) values that satisfy this condition. The current program does not implement this calculation or any other logic to find such points.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a solution to the problem as described.
