Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not include any logic to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are helper functions related to the greatest common divisor and linear combinations, which are not directly relevant to solving the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The problem requires determining the coordinates of the points, but the provided code does not contain any implementation to achieve this. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct based on the problem description and the expected functionality.
