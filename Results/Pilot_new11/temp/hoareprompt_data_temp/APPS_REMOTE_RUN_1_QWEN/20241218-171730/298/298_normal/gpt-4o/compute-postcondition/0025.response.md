The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. The parameters are constrained such that $n$ and $m$ are positive integers within the range $1 \le n, m \le 10^9$, and $k$ is an integer within the range $2 \le k \le 10^9$. 

Based on the given output cases, the function returns a value depending on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, since no specific return values are mentioned in the provided information, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` with the specified constraints and return a value based on their relationship, though the exact nature of the return value is not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range $1 \le n, m \le 10^9$ and `k` is an integer within the range $2 \le k \le 10^9$, and returns a value based on their relationship.**
