The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers where \(b \neq 0\). The function returns either 1 and 0 in a specific case, or it returns `y, x - a // b * y` where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with \(b \neq 0\)), and return either 1 and 0 in a certain condition, or `y, x - a // b * y` based on the recursive call to itself with parameters `b` and `a % b`.
