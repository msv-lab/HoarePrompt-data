According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`**
