Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required amount of lemonade \( L \) is exactly 1 liter. Let's consider this specific case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  2 1
  10 100
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  The minimum cost to buy at least 1 liter of lemonade is 10 roubles (since the smallest bottle is 1 liter and costs 10 roubles).

- **Actual Output:**
  The program will incorrectly output the cost of the largest bottle, which is 100 roubles, because it assumes the cost of the next largest bottle (which is 2 liters and costs 100 roubles) is the minimum cost for 1 liter of lemonade.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the exact amount of lemonade needed is the smallest possible bottle size. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
