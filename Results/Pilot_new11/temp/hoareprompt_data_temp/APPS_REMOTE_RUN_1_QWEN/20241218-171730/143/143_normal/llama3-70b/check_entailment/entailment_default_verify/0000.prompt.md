You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to minimize the cost of purchasing at least L liters of lemonade. The program initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy exactly i liters of lemonade. It iterates through each possible volume of bottles and updates the DP array accordingly. The program handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints. The logic ensures that the minimum cost is found by considering all possible combinations of bottle types up to the required liters, making it correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes two integers `n` and `L` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 30 and 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). It then calculates the minimum cost to obtain exactly `L` liters of liquid using bottles of various volumes (2^j - 1 liters for j from 0 to n-1), where the cost of each bottle type is specified in the `costs` list. If it's possible to obtain exactly `L` liters, it returns the minimum cost; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Potential edge cases include when `L` is 0, which is handled by setting `dp[0] = 0` initially. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where no combination of bottle volumes can sum up to `L`, which is why the final check `if dp[L] != float('inf')` ensures that -1 is returned in such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
