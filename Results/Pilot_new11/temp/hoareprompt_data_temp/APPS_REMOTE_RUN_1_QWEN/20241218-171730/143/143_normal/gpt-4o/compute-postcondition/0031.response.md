`current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. The value of `i` is 28, so `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + dp[28]`. The other variables (`L` and `answer`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[28]`, `L` is `L - 2^{29}` if `L >= 2^{29}`, otherwise `L` remains unchanged, `answer` is updated to the minimum value between `answer` and `current_cost_new + (L_new > 0) * dp[29]`**
