The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `c`. Here, `n` and `L` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30` and `1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9`, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` represents the cost of a bottle of type `i`, and `1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9`. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we infer the following:

- Case_1: The function returns a value related to the costs in the list `c`.
- Case_2: The function returns a value related to the integer `L`.

However, since no specific conditions or outputs are given for each case, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `L`, and `c`, where `n` and `L` are integers with specific constraints, and `c` is a list of integers with specific constraints, and it returns a value based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `L`, and `c`, where `n` and `L` are integers with specific constraints, and `c` is a list of integers with specific constraints, and it returns a value based on the given conditions.**
