According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts from 1 and increments `i` by 1 until it reaches 31. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `dp[2]` is `dp[1] * 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- Since the value of `dp[i]` is dependent on the previous value of `dp[i-1]`, we need to calculate `dp[3]` as `dp[2] * 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 3; `dp[3]` is `dp[2] * 2`**
