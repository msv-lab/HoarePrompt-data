The code `costs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list is then assigned to the variable `costs`. The initial values of `c` and `n` are no longer directly relevant, but `L` remains unchanged.

The new list `costs` contains the same number of elements as `n`, and each element is an integer representing the cost of a bottle of a certain type. The exact values in the list `costs` depend on the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers read from input, `L` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9**
