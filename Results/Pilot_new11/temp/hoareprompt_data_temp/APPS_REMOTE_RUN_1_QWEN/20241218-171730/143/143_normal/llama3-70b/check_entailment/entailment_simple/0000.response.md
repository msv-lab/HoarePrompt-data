Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here’s a breakdown of why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the values of `n` and `L` from the first line of input, which are used to determine the number of bottle types and the required amount of lemonade, respectively.
   - It then reads the costs of the bottles from the second line of input and stores them in the list `costs`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to obtain exactly `i` liters of lemonade.
   - The base case is set to `dp[0] = 0`, meaning no cost is needed to get 0 liters of lemonade.
   - The nested loops iterate over possible amounts of lemonade `i` and bottle types `j`. For each combination, it calculates the volume of the current bottle type `vol = 2 ** j - 1`.
   - If the volume of the current bottle is less than or equal to the current amount `i`, the program updates `dp[i]` to the minimum cost of obtaining `i - vol` liters plus the cost of the current bottle.

3. **Output**:
   - After filling the DP table, the program prints `dp[L]`, which gives the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade. If `dp[L]` remains infinity, it means it’s impossible to achieve `L` liters, and the program prints `-1`.

The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description, ensuring that it computes the minimum cost to achieve the required amount of lemonade. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all cases as specified. Thus, the program is correct.
