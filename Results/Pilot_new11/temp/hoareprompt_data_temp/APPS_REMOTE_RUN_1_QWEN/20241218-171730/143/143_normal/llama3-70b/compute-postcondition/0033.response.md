Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element from 1 to `L` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - (2 ** j - 1)] + costs[j]` if `2 ** j - 1 <= i` for every `j` from 0 to `n-1`. `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes.**
