The code initializes a list `dp` with the value `max_cost` (which is 10) repeated 31 times. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, or `max_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is 10**
