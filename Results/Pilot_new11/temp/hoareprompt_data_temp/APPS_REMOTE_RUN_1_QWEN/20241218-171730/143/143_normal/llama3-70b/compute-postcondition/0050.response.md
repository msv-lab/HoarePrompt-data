The code snippet provided prints a value from the `dp` list. Specifically, it checks if `dp[L]` is not equal to `float('inf')`. If `dp[L]` is not `float('inf')`, it prints `dp[L]`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. No variables are updated or modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is in the printed output, which depends on the value of `dp[L]`.

Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `L`) is the minimum cost to achieve `i` using the given costs, `dp[0]` is 0, and the output is `dp[L]` if `dp[L]` is not `float('inf')`, otherwise `-1`.**
