#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum of its original value (10) and the corresponding element in `c`, `c` is a list of n+1 integers where the first n integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 29 to 0 where `L >= 2^i`, `L` is the remainder after subtracting all possible `2^i` from the original `L`, `answer` is the minimum value of `max_cost` and the calculated `current_cost`.
    return answer
    #The program returns answer which is the minimum value of max_cost and the calculated current_cost
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. It calculates the minimum cost required to satisfy the given length `L` using the provided costs. Here’s the detailed functionality:

1. Initializes `dp` as a list of size 31, where each element is set to a very large value (`10
