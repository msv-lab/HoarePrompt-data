The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates a new position in the 2x2 grid based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Given the precondition, `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, which are within the bounds of the grid. The calculation of `new_pos` does not change the values of the other variables but updates `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` does not contain `start`, `visited` contains `start`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
