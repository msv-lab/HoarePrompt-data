The value of `x1` is assigned the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `x1` is now equal to `i`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is equal to `i`, `x2` is 4**
