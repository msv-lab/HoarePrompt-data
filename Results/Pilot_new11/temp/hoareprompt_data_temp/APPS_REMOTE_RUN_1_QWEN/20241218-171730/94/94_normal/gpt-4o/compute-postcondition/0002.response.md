The code initializes a list `directions` with four tuples representing possible movements in a 2x2 grid (up, down, left, right). The values of `start`, `queue`, and `visited` remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.**
