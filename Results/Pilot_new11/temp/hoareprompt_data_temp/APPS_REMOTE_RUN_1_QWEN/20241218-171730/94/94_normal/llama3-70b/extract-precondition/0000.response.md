Precondition: **puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of four characters each, where each character is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X'. The string represents a 2x2 grid of a sliding puzzle, with 'A', 'B', and 'C' representing tiles and 'X' representing the empty cell. Both puzzles guarantee that they have exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.**
