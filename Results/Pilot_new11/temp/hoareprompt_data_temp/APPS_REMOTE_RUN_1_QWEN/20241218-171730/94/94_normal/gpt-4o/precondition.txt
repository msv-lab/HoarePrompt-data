puzzle is a list containing four strings, each string is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent the tiles and 'X' represents the empty cell. The list is structured as [bessie_row1, bessie_row2, elsie_row1, elsie_row2], where each row is a string of length 2. It is guaranteed that each puzzle contains exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
