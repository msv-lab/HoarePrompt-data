The code swaps the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's analyze the impact:

- `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.
- `new_state[empty_pos]` originally contains the element at position `empty_pos` in the list.
- `new_state[new_pos]` originally contains the element at position `new_pos` in the list.

After the swap, the values at these positions are reversed. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`new_state[empty_pos]` is now the original value of `new_state[new_pos]`, `new_state[new_pos]` is now the original value of `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements, `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions` remain unchanged.**
