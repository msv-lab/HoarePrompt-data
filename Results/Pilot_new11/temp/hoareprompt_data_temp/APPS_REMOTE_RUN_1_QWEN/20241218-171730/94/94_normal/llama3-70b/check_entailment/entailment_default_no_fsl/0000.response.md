Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the puzzles are equivalent after a single swap operation, but it fails to consider all possible sequences of moves that could lead to the same configuration. The sorting step in `func_1` does not account for the fact that the puzzles can be manipulated through multiple moves, and it incorrectly assumes that a simple swap is sufficient to check for equivalence.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC
```

The correct output should be "YES" because Bessie can slide her 'A' tile down to match Elsie's configuration. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks for a single swap and does not consider other possible sequences of moves.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the initial configurations are already the same but not in the same orientation. For example:

```
Input
AB
XC
AX
BC
```

In this case, the initial configurations are the same but not aligned, and the correct output should be "YES". However, the current implementation will also incorrectly output "NO" because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the tiles through multiple moves.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect result.
