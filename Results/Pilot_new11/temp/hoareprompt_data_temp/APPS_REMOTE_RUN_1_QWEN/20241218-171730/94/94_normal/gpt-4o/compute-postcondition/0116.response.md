The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. The string is composed of four characters, and it is guaranteed that there is exactly one 'X', one 'A', one 'B', and one 'C' in the string.

Case_1: The program returns a set `visited` containing all unique puzzle states reachable from `start` through valid moves.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `start` representing the initial state of a 2x2 sliding puzzle and return a set of all unique puzzle states that can be reached from the starting state through valid moves.
