Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration through a series of valid moves. Here are the key issues:

1. **Swapping the Empty Cells**: The function swaps the empty cells ('X') between the two puzzles. However, this does not simulate a valid sequence of moves. Swapping the empty cell does not guarantee that the puzzles can be brought to the same configuration, as valid moves require sliding a tile into the empty cell, not just swapping the empty cell itself.

2. **Sorting the Puzzles**: The function sorts the characters of the two puzzles and checks if they are the same. Sorting assumes that the relative positions of the tiles are irrelevant, which is not true for the sliding puzzle. The order in which the tiles are arranged matters, and simply sorting the characters does not capture the necessary constraints of the sliding puzzle.

3. **Initial Configuration Check**: The function does not consider whether the initial configurations of the puzzles can be transformed into each other through a sequence of valid moves. It only checks if the characters are the same after an invalid operation (swapping the empty cells).

To correctly solve the problem, the function should simulate the possible moves from the initial configurations and check if the final states of the puzzles can match. This involves checking if a series of valid moves (sliding tiles into the empty cell) can transform one puzzle into the other.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the puzzles can be made identical through valid moves, and hence it is incorrect.
