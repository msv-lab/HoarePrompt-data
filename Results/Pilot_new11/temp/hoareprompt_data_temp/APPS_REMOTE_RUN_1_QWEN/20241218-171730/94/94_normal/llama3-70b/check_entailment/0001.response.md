Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to swap the positions of the empty cells (`X`) between the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted configurations match. However, this approach only considers a single swap, which is insufficient because the puzzles may require multiple moves to align.

2. **No Consideration of Tile Movements**: The program does not simulate the actual sliding of tiles, which is required to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. It simply swaps the empty cells and checks if the resulting configurations are identical.

3. **Unnecessary String Operations**: The code converts the lists to strings and removes newlines, which is unnecessary and could introduce errors. The original data structure (lists) is more appropriate for manipulating the puzzle states.

4. **Limited Scope of Functionality**: The function `func_1` only checks a single swap scenario and does not explore all possible sequences of moves, which is necessary to determine if the puzzles can be made identical.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
CB
AX
```
The program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks a single swap scenario, but the correct answer should be "NO" because no sequence of valid moves can transform the first puzzle into the second.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the output should be "NO" for this input, making the overall correctness **False**.
