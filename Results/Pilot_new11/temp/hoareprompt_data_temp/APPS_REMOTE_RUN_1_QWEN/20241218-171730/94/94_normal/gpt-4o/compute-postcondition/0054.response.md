Postcondition: ***`queue` is a non-empty list. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`. `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a copy of `current`, with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string that represents the joined elements of `new_state`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, the list `queue` remains unchanged.***
