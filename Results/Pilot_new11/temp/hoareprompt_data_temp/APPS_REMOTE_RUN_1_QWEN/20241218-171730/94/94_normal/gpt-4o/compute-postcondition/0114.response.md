Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all unique puzzle states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is not defined (as the loop has terminated), `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not defined (as the loop has terminated), `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str` are not defined (as they were local to each iteration of the loop).**
