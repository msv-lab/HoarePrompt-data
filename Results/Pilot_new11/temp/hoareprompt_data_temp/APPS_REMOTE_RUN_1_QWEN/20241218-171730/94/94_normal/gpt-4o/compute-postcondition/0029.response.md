According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `directions`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `directions`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`.
- `new_state` now has the swapped elements.
- `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected.
- `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged.
- If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still elements in `directions`. If there are no more elements in `directions`, the loop will terminate.

Given that the other states remain unchanged and do not affect the loop condition, we only need to check if `directions` has any elements left.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos` remain unchanged; `directions` must have at least one element**.
