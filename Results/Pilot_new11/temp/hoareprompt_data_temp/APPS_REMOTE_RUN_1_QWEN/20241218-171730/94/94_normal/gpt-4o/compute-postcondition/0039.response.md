Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a list of unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `visited` is a set containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state processed (if the loop ran), `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, no `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, or `new_state_str` are defined (as they were local to each iteration of the loop).**

### Explanation:
- **`start`**: Remains unchanged as it represents the initial state of the puzzle.
- **`queue`**: Contains all unique states that can be reached from `start` by moving the empty space in valid directions. Once a state is added to `queue`, it remains there unless it is processed and potentially added to `visited`.
- **`visited`**: Contains all unique states that have been processed and cannot be revisited to avoid cycles.
- **`directions`**: Remains unchanged as it defines the possible movements of the empty space.
- **`current`**: The last state processed (if the loop ran) since it would be the state at the front of `queue` just before it was removed.
- **`empty_row`** and **`empty_col`**: These are derived from the position of the empty space (`empty_pos`) and do not change between iterations.
- **Local Variables (`new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`)**: These are local to each iteration of the loop and do not persist outside the loop. They are used to generate new states and check if they have been visited.

Since the loop processes each state in the queue and generates new states only if they haven't been visited, both `queue` and `visited` will eventually contain all reachable unique states from the initial state `start`. The loop terminates when there are no more unique states to process.
