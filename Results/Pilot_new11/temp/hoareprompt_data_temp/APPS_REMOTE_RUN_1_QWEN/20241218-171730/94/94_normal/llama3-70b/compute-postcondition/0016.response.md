Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is 4. If the character at index `i` in `puzzle2` is 'X', `x1` is updated to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`. Otherwise, the values of `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged.***
