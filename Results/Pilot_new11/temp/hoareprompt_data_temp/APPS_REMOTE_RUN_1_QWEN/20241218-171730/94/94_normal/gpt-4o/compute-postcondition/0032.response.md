The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the current state. This means that `new_state` is now a list representation of `current`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements; `new_state` is a list representation of `current`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `directions` remain unchanged.**
