Postcondition: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the `new_state` list; `new_state_str` is not in `visited`**
