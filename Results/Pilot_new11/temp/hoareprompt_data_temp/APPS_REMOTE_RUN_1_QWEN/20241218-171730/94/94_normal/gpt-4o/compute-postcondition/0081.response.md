Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over a sequence of tuples `(dr, dc)` from the `directions` list.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves some action based on these direction changes.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `current` is the first element of the queue (before `popleft`).
   - `queue` is the original queue minus its first element.
   - `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.

3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are valid direction tuples in `directions`.
   - The initial state of `current` and `queue` must allow for the possibility of moving based on the direction tuples.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `directions` is not specified, we need to ensure that `directions` is non-empty. Otherwise, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial state of `current` and `queue` should reflect a valid puzzle state where movement is possible.

Based on this reasoning, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `directions` is a non-empty list.
- `current` is a valid state representing a puzzle with an 'X' position that allows for movements based on the direction tuples.

### Final State Adjustment

State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `current` is a valid puzzle state with 'X', `queue` is the original queue minus its first element, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2**
