The code `x2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x2`. The variable `i` represents the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`. Since the initial state indicates that `i` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, and no other changes are made to `x1` or any other variables, the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings of four characters each, containing exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`; `x2` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.**
