To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and requirements specified:

1. **`directions` is a non-empty list**: This condition ensures there are possible moves to explore.
2. **`current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position**: This means we have a valid puzzle configuration to start with.
3. **`new_pos` is calculated as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**: This formula calculates a new position based on the current empty position and the direction `(dr, dc)` from the `directions` list.
4. **If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped**: This checks if the new position is within bounds and swaps the 'X' (empty) position with the new position.
5. **`new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`**: This creates a string representation of the new puzzle state.
6. **`visited` either includes `new_state_str` or remains unchanged**: If the new state hasn't been visited before, it gets added to `visited`.
7. **`queue` either includes `new_state_str` or remains unchanged**: If the new state hasn't been queued before, it gets added to `queue`.

Given that these conditions must hold true for the loop to continue, let's summarize the states at the start of the next iteration:

- The `directions` list must still be non-empty for the loop to continue.
- The `current` puzzle state remains valid.
- The `new_pos` calculation needs to be evaluated for each direction.
- If the new position is within bounds (`0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`), the `new_state` is updated.
- The `new_state_str` is derived from the updated `new_state`.
- If the `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, it is added.
- If the `new_state_str` is not already in `queue`, it is added.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

- `directions` must remain non-empty.
- `current` remains unchanged.
- `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction.
- `new_state` is updated only if the new position is within bounds.
- `new_state_str` is updated accordingly.
- `visited` may include the new state if it wasn't previously visited.
- `queue` may include the new state if it wasn't previously queued.

Since the problem doesn't specify a specific `direction` to consider, the general state adjustments for the loop to continue would be based on the conditions above.

State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated if new position is within bounds; `new_state_str` is updated; `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged**.
