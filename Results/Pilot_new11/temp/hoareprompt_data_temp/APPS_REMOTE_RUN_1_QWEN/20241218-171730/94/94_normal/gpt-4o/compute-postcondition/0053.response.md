The code appends `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is a non-empty list with an additional element `new_state_str` appended to it, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a copy of `current`, with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string that represents the joined elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` is in `visited`.
