The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the contents of `new_state` or `new_state_str` themselves but ensures that `new_state_str` is now a member of the `visited` set.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` remains unchanged.**
