The code reads a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns it to `y`. The number of elements in `y` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the original list `x`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), and `y` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), with the same length as `x`.**
