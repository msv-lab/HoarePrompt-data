`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer entered by the user. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, and `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ `x[i]` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `y[i]` ≤ 1000 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`.**
