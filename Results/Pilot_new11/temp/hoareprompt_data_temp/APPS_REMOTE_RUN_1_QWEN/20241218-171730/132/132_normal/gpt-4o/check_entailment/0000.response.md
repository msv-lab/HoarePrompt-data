Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where stones may be moved from one pile to another. For instance, consider the following case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 3 9
  1 7 9
  ```

According to the problem description, one of the jury members could have moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile and another stone from the first pile to the third pile. However, the program only checks if the total number of stones in the second visit is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first visit. It does not account for the possibility of moving stones between piles.

Since the program fails to consider the movement of stones between piles, it cannot correctly determine if the notes can be consistent. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
