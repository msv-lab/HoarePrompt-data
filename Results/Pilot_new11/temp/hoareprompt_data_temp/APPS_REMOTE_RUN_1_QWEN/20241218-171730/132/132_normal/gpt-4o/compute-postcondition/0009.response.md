Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) with the same length as `x`, `total_x` is the sum of the elements in the list `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of the elements in the list `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed to the console.***
