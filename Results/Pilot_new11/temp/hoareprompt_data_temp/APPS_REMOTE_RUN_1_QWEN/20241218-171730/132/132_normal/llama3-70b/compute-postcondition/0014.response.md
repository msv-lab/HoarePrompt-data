The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `x` and `y` are lists of integers such that the length of both `x` and `y` is `n`.
- For all `i` in the range of `n`, 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000.

Based on the output cases provided, the function has two possible return values:

- Case_1: The function returns the sum of all elements in list `x`.
- Case_2: The function returns the sum of all elements in list `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `x`, and `y` and return either the sum of all elements in list `x` or the sum of all elements in list `y`, depending on which case is fulfilled. If one case is fulfilled, none of the others are.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`. It returns the sum of all elements in list `x` or the sum of all elements in list `y` based on the specified conditions.**
