Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks only if the total number of stones in the second configuration is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first configuration. However, this is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the notes according to the problem description. The program fails to consider the possibility of jury members moving stones between different piles, which is allowed according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```

- The first configuration has a total of 14 stones.
- The second configuration also has a total of 17 stones, but the distribution has changed.

The program would incorrectly output "Yes" because the total number of stones is the same, but it doesn't check if the transformation from the first configuration to the second configuration is possible given the allowed actions (moving or taking one stone at a time).

A correct solution would involve checking if each pile's stone count transition is possible under the given rules, which is not implemented in the current program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
