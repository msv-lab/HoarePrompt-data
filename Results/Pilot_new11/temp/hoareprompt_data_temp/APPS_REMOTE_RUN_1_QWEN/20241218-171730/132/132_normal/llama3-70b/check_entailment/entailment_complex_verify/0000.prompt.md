You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of stones in the piles can change due to the jury moving stones between piles. The program only checks if the total number of stones is the same and if the sorted lists of stones are identical. However, it fails to account for the possibility that stones could have been moved between different piles.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
- The initial number of stones in piles is `[2, 3, 9]`.
- The final number of stones in piles is `[1, 7, 9]`.

According to the problem description, the jury can move one stone from one pile to another. In this case, one stone could have been moved from the first pile to the second pile, resulting in the valid configuration `[1, 7, 9]`.

However, the program will incorrectly print "No" because the sorted lists `x` and `y` are not identical. This means the program does not correctly determine if the changes in the number of stones in the piles could have occurred due to valid moves by the jury members.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case and hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and x and y are lists of integers such that the length of x and y is n, and 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all i in range(n).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a sorted list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and `y` is sorted. If `x` is equal to `y`, the console displays 'Yes'. Otherwise, the console displays 'No'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, and `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers. If the sum of elements in list `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in list `y`, the console prints 'No'. Otherwise, `x` is sorted, and `y` is also sorted. If `x` equals `y`, the console displays 'Yes'. Otherwise, the console displays 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes no explicit parameters but reads three inputs from the user: an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` of length `n`. It first checks if the sums of the elements in `x` and `y` are equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'. If they are equal, it sorts both `x` and `y` and then checks if the sorted lists are identical. If the sorted lists are identical, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return anything but modifies and prints the results based on the comparison of the lists and their sums. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or greater than 50, which is not checked within the function, and the possibility of empty lists or non-integer inputs, which could cause issues with the input parsing.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
