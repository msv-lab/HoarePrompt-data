The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables' values. Therefore, the only change is the output to the console.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), with the same length as `x`, `total_x` is the sum of the elements in the list `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the elements in the list `y`, and the sum of the elements in the list `y` is greater than the sum of the elements in the list `x`; 'No' is printed to the console.**
