The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `x`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `y` is not affected.

Since the input is split and converted to integers, `x` will now be a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), and `n` will still be the length of this list. `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), and `y` is a list of `n` integers of the same length as before.**
