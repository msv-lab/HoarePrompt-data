`start` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that the next character in `trophies` (at index `i`) should not be 'G'. The values of `n`, `trophies`, and `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and now includes the tuple (1, n), `start` is equal to `i`, and the next character in `trophies` (at index `i`) should not be 'G'.**
