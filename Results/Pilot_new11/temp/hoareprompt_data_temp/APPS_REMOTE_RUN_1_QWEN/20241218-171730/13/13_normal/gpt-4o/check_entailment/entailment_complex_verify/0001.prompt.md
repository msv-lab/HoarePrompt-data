You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are isolated groups of golden trophies with no silver trophies between them. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where swapping the last golden trophy in one segment with the first golden trophy in the next segment could potentially increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies.

Consider the following input:
```
9
GGGSGGGSG
```

The program would output `6` because it only considers the direct adjacency between segments without checking the possibility of a swap between the last trophy of one segment and the first trophy of the next segment. However, the correct output should be `7` as explained in the problem note, where swapping the trophies at positions `4` and `9` results in the sequence "GGGGGGGSG", which has a longest subsegment of `7` golden trophies.

To fix this, the program needs to check the possibility of swapping the last trophy of one segment with the first trophy of the next segment when they are separated by exactly one silver trophy. This would allow for the calculation of the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `i` is `n`, and `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found. If no segment of 'G's is found, `segments` is an empty list.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `i` is `n`, and `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found. At least one segment of 'G's is found.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #`The program returns the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `i` is `n`, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. **`len(segments)` is not equal to 1**.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's found after considering all possible valid pairs of segments, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `prev_start` is the starting index of the previous segment of 'G's found, `prev_end` is the ending index of the previous segment of 'G's found, `curr_start` is the starting index of the current segment of 'G's found, `curr_end` is the ending index of the current segment of 'G's found, `len(segments)` is the number of segments in `segments`. If the loop does not execute, `max_length` remains the same as its initial value, otherwise, `max_length` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and (curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1) whenever the condition `curr_start - prev_end == 2` is met.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies`, a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy. 

After analyzing the code, the function performs the following actions:
1. It identifies all segments of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string and stores them in the `segments` list as tuples of their starting and ending indices.
2. If no segments of 'G's are found, the function returns 0.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's.
4. It then checks if there are adjacent segments (i.e., segments where the end of one segment is exactly two positions before the start of the next segment). For such pairs, it updates the maximum length to include the gap between these segments.
5. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and `n`.

The function covers all potential cases as follows:
- If there are no segments of 'G's, the function returns 0.
- If there is only one segment of 'G's, the function returns the length of this segment.
- If there are multiple segments of 'G's and there are adjacent segments, the function updates the maximum length to include the gaps between these segments.
- In all other cases, the function returns the minimum value between the maximum length plus one and `n`.
