The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code snippet, we assume this `break` is outside of any such structure, and thus, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 5, `beauty` remains the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + (1 or 2), `left` remains the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` remains `n`, `max_beauty` remains the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` remains incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, and `golden` remains a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
