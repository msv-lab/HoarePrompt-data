The code increments the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was less than `k + 1` and `s[left]` is not 'G', incrementing `left` by 1 does not violate the condition that `s[left]` is not 'G'. The value of `curr_beauty` remains 0, and all other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is now `left + 1` and is still less than `k + 1` and `s[left]` is not 'G', `right` is `k + 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0.**
