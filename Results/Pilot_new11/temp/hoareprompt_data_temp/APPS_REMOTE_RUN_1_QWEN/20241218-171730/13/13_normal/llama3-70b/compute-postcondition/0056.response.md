To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the initial states and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's.
- `right` is `n`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 2`. This requires `i` to be in the range `[0, n - 2]`.
2. **Initialization of Variables**: Initially, `i` is set to 0, and it increments by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, `i` will start at 0 and continue until it reaches `n - 2`.
3. **Initial Values of Variables**: We know:
   - `curr_beauty` is 0.
   - `left` is either the index of the last 'G' in `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's).
   - `right` is `n`.
   - `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` are both 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, we need to ensure that `i` can reach `n - 2` without encountering any issues. This means that `i` should start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 2`.
- The value of `n` must be such that `n - 1` is a valid index within the bounds of the string `s` and the list `golden`.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `i` starts at 0 and will increment until it reaches `n - 2`.
- Ensure `n` is such that `n - 1` is a valid index in the string `s` and list `golden`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is 0, `n` is such that `n - 1` is a valid index in `s` and `golden`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.**
