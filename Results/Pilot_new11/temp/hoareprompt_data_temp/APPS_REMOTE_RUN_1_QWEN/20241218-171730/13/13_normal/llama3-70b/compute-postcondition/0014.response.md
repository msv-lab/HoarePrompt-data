To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `left` is 1 (since it was originally 0 and incremented by 1)
- `right` is at least 1 and `s[right]` is not 'G'

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions within the `while` loop must be true:
1. `left < right`
2. `s[left] != 'G'`

Let's examine each condition:

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**
   - Currently, `left` is 1.
   - For this condition to remain true, `right` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != 'G'`**
   - Currently, `s[left]` is not 'G' (since `left` is 1 and we know `s[right]` is not 'G' and `right` is at least 1).
   - This condition is already satisfied as `s[left]` is not 'G'.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we only need to adjust the state of `right` to be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` must be greater than 1 and `s[right]` is not 'G'**
