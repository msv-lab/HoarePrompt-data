Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list that may include elements like `['G']`, `(1, i-1)`, or `(1, n)`, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `trophies[i] == 'G'`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1, and `start` is equal to `i` if `trophies[i] == 'G'`. The character `trophies[i+1]` is 'S'.***
