State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `right` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `right` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`.
3. Initially, `right` should be set to 0 to begin the iteration.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to include `right` being set to 0.
