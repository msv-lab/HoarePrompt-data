The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given that the initial value of `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, this value will increase by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + 1, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'. The current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
