The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
