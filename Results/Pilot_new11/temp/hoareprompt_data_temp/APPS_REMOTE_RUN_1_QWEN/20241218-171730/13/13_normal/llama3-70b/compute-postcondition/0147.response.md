Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged and the character at index `j` is not 'G'.**
