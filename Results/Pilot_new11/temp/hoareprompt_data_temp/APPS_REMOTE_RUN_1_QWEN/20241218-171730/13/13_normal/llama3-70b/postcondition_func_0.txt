The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). It calculates two values: `max_beauty`, which is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in the string, and `max_beauty_one_swap`, which is the maximum beauty (length of consecutive 'G's) achievable by swapping exactly one 'S' to 'G'. The function then prints the maximum of these two values. The function handles edge cases where there are no 'G's in the string.
