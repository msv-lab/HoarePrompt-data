To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
   - `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is 'G' and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the old value of `curr_beauty`.
   - `left` and `right` are both initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `right = 0` to `right = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `right` increases by 1.
   - If `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[right]` is not 'G', `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the old value of `curr_beauty`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume the previous iteration was for `right = k` where `k < n-1`.

4. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `right` will be `k+1`.
   - Since `left` is not modified in the loop, it remains 0.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and the old value of `curr_beauty` from the previous iteration.
   - `curr_beauty` might have been incremented or remained unchanged based on the value of `s[k+1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (for `right = k+1`) will be:

- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `golden` remains the same.
- `max_beauty` remains the same.
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` becomes `k+1`.
- `curr_beauty` is either the value from the previous iteration or `curr_beauty + 1` if `s[k+1]` is 'G'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 1**.
