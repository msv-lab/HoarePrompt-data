The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is 2, so after the increment, `left` becomes 3. The value of `left` is now updated, but none of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `right` is 2, and `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 3.**
