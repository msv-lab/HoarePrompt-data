`i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that the next character in `trophies` (at index `i`) is 'S', so after incrementing `i` by 1, the next character in `trophies` will be 'G' (since `i` was pointing to the 'S' before the increment).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and now includes the tuple (1, n), and the next character in `trophies` (at index `i`) is 'G'**
