Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and may now include the tuple (1, i-1) or (1, n) depending on the condition; the character `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes. It accounts for both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the program variables and their relationships align with the conditions specified in each part.
