`s` is assigned the value of the input string, which consists of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'**
