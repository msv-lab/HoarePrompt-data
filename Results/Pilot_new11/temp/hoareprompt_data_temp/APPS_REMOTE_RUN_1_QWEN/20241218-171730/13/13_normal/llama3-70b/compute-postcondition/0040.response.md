The code updates `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. The variables `golden`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's)
- `right` is `k + 1`

After executing the code:
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

The output state remains:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's), `right` is `k + 1`. `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.**
