The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Given the initial state, the only thing that happens is that the execution would break out of the current loop or conditional block, but no variables are modified.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
