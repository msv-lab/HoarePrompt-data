According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate over the range from `i + 2` to `n`.

Before the loop starts:
- `j` is currently -1.
- The loop will start when `j` is set to `i + 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the initial state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `j` needs to be set to `i + 2` for the loop to begin.

State: **`j` is \(i + 2\), `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` are unchanged.**
