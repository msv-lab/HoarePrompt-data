Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is `i + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 4`. If `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged.***
