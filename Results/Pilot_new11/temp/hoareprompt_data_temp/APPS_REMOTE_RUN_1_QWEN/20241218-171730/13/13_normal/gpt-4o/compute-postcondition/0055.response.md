Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `max_length` is updated to \(\max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 2)\), `len(segments)` must be greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, `max_length` is updated accordingly.***
