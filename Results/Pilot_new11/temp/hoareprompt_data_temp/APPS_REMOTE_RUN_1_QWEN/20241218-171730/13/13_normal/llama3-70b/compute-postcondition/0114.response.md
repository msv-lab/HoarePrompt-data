According to the given code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `s[j]` is 'G'. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `j` is `i + 2`
- `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', and unchanged otherwise
- `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, `s[j]` must be 'G'. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 and checked again.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`.
2. For the loop to continue, `s[j]` must be 'G'.
3. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes `i + 3`).
4. `beauty` is updated based on the new value of `j` (if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains the same).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be `i + 3`
- `beauty` should be incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'; otherwise, it remains the same
- `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged

State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise unchanged, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged**
