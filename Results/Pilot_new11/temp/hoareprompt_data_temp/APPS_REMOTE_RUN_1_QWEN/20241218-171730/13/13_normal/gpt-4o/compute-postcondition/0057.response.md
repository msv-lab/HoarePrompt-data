Output State: **`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`**.

Explanation: The given code snippet assigns the values of `segments[i - 1]` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`. It does not affect any other variables. The values of `n`, `trophies`, `segments`, `start`, `max_length`, `i`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged from their initial states.
