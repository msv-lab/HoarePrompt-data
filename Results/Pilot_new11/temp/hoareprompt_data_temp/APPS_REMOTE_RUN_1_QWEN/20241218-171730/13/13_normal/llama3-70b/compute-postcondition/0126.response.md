The code `beauty = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `beauty`. This operation directly updates the value of `beauty` without affecting the values of other variables. The initial conditions for `i`, `j`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is either `i + 3` if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is false, or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 2` if the condition is true, `beauty` is 1, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its original value and `beauty`**
