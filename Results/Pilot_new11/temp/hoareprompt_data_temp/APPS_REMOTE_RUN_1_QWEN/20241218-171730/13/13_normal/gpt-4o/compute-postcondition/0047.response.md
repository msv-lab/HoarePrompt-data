Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `i` is `n`, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. The current value of `len(segments)` is 1.***
