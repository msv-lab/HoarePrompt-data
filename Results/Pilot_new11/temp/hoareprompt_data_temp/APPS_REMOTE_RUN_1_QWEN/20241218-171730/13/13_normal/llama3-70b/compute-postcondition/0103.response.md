To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the conditions and variables involved in the loop. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - `j` is `i - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i - 1` down to `-1` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the loop breaks.

4. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be decreased by 1 to `i - 3`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - If `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` will be incremented.
   - If `s[j] != 'G'`, the loop will break immediately.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be set to `i - 3`.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same since it does not depend on `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`**.
