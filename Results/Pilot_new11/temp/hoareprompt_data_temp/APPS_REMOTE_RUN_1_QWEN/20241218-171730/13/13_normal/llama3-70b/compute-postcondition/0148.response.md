Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `s` is a string.
- `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, or 0 if no such character exists.
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring, or -1 if no 'G' character is found.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `i + 2` to `n`.

### Key Points:
- The loop starts with `j = i + 2`.
- For each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is set to `i + 2`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 2` (if it just started) or was incremented by 1 from the previous value.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` becomes `i + 3` (if it just started) or the next value after the previous increment.

4. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
   - Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Updated States:
- `i` remains a non-negative integer.
- `s` remains the same string.
- `beauty` remains the same count of 'G' characters in the substring.
- `j` must be `i + 3` (since it was `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration and needs to be incremented by 1).
- `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
