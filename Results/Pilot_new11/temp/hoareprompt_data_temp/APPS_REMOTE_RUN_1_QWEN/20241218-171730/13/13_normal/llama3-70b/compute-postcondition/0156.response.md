Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `j` set to `i + 2` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
- If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.
- If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks, and `j` retains its last value.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the bounds of the string `s` and the character at `j` is 'G'.

After the loop finishes executing, the following conditions hold:
- `beauty` will be the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered.
- `j` will be the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring, or -1 if no 'G' character is found.
- The loop will have executed as long as `n` is greater than `i + 1`, ensuring that there are enough indices to check starting from `i + 2`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
