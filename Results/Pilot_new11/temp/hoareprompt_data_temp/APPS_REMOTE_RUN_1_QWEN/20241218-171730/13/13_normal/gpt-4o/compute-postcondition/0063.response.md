The code updates the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end`. Initially, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`, and `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`. After executing the code, `curr_start` will be set to the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, and `curr_end` will be set to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. The values of `prev_start`, `prev_end`, and the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.**
