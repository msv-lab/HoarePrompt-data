The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. Each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. The function does not directly return anything from the provided information, but based on the constraints, it implies that the function might perform some operation on the list `a`.

However, since the specific operation or return value is not detailed, we will focus only on the input parameters and their constraints.
