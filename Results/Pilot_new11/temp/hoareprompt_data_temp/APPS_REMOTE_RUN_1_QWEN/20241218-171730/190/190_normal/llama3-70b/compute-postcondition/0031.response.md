Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `mid + 1`
   - `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost
   - `min_cost` is the current lower value of `cost`
   - `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers
   - `t` is equal to `mid`
   - `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.
   - If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_t` is updated to `mid + 1` and `min_cost` is updated to `cost`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `mid + 1` to 100 (inclusive).

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(mid + 1, 101)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from its current value (`mid + 1`) to the next integer value, which is `mid + 2`.

4. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `min_t`, `min_cost`, `sticks`, `t`, and `cost` should remain unchanged unless the loop updates them within its body. Since the problem statement does not mention any changes to these variables inside the loop body, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `mid + 2`
   - `min_t` remains the same (since `cost` was not less than `min_cost` to update it)
   - `min_cost` remains the same
   - `sticks` remains the same
   - `t` remains the same
   - `cost` remains the same

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `mid + 2`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current lower value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`.**
