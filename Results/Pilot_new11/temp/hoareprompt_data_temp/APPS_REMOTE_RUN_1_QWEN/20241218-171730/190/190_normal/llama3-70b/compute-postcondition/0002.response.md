The `sort()` method sorts the list `sticks` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the value of `n`. After sorting, the smallest element in `sticks` will be at index 0, and the largest at index `n-1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers**
