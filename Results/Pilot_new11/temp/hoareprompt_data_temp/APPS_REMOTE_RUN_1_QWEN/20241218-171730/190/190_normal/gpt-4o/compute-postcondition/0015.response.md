The code updates `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to its current value. Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of n integers
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `min_cost` is infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 1
- `current_cost` is `length - 2` (where `length` is the second element in the list `a`)
- `length` is the second element in the list `a`

We can substitute the known values into the equation:
- `t` is 1
- `length` is the second element in the list `a`, let's call it `second_element_of_a`

So, the equation for `current_cost` becomes:
\[ current_cost += 1 - 1 - second\_element\_of\_a = -second\_element\_of\_a \]

Given that `current_cost` was initially `length - 2` and `length` is `second_element_of_a`, we substitute:
\[ current_cost = second\_element\_of\_a - 2 \]

After the update:
\[ current_cost = (second\_element\_of\_a - 2) - second\_element\_of\_a = -2 \]

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is -2, `length` is the second element in the list `a`.**
