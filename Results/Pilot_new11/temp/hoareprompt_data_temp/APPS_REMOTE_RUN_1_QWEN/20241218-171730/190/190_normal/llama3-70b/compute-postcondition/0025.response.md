Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `mid + 1` to `100` (inclusive). This means that the loop will start when `i` is equal to `mid + 1`.

2. **Current states**:
   - `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost.
   - `min_cost` is the minimum cost found.
   - `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
   - `t` is equal to `mid`.
   - `cost` is the initial cost.

3. **Loop initialization**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to `mid + 1`. This is because the loop starts from `mid + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `mid + 1` to start the loop.
   - The other states (`min_t`, `min_cost`, `sticks`, `t`, and `cost`) are not directly affected by the loop starting condition but might change within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the initial cost**.
