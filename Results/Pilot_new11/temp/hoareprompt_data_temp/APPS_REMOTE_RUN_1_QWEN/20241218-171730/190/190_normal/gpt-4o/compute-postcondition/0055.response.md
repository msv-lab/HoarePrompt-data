The code sets `current_cost` to 0, which initializes it to this value. The initial value of `current_cost` was based on the conditions within the loop, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables (`a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 3`, `current_cost` is 0.**
