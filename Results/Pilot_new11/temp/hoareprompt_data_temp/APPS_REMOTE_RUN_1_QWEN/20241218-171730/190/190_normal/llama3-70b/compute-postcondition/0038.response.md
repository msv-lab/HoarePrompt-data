The line `min_cost = cost` assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This means that `min_cost` is updated to the current value of `cost`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_cost` and keeps the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`, and `min_cost` is now equal to the current value of `cost`.**
