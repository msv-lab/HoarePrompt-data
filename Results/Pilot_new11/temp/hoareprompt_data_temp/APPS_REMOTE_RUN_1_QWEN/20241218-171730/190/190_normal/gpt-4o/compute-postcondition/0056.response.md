Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `length`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element (since `a` is stated to be a non-empty list).

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `min_cost`: This is given but its value doesn't directly affect whether the loop can execute. It will be updated within the loop.
   - `best_t`: Initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `t`: Initially set to `n + 3`.
   - `current_cost`: Initially set to 0.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Therefore, `a` must have at least one element for the loop to start executing.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element.
   - No other variables need adjustment since they are not directly related to the loop condition.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list, containing at least one element**.

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the provided information.
