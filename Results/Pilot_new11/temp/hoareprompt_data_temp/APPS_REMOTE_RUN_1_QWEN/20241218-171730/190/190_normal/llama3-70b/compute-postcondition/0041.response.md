To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to `100`. For each `i`, it calculates the `cost` as the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`. It updates `min_t` and `min_cost` if the calculated `cost` is less than the current `min_cost`.

### Observations from Provided States:
- After 1 iteration (`i = mid + 1`): 
  - `i` is `mid + 1`
  - `min_t` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `min_cost` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `sticks` remains the same
  - `t` remains `mid`
  - `cost` is recalculated for each `x` in `sticks`

- After 2 iterations (`i = mid + 2`):
  - `i` is `mid + 2`
  - `min_t` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `min_cost` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `sticks` remains the same
  - `t` remains `mid`
  - `cost` is recalculated for each `x` in `sticks`

- After 3 iterations (`i = mid + 3`):
  - `i` is `mid + 3`
  - `min_t` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `min_cost` is updated if the cost is less than `min_cost`
  - `sticks` remains the same
  - `t` remains `mid`
  - `cost` is recalculated for each `x` in `sticks`

### Conclusion:
The loop continues until `i` reaches `100`. Therefore, the loop will execute at most `99 - mid` times. The loop updates `min_t` and `min_cost` whenever it finds a new minimum cost. The final values of `min_t` and `min_cost` will be the result of these updates.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will be:
- `i` will be `100` because the loop stops when `i` reaches `100`.
- `min_t` will be the value of `i` that minimizes the cost during the loop execution.
- `min_cost` will be the minimum cost found during the loop execution.
- `sticks` remains the same.
- `t` remains `mid`.
- `cost` is the last calculated cost when `i` is `100`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `100`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the last calculated cost when `i` is `100`.**
