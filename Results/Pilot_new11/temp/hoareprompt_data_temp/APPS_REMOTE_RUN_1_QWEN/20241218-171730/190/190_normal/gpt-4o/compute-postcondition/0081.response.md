The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints, it implies that the function should internally handle an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). The output of the function depends on the input list `a`.

Given the information, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but it seems the function might return some kind of result based on the list `a`. Since no specific output is mentioned, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).**
