The code `current_cost = 0` initializes `current_cost` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables such as `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `length`. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `a` remains a list of `n` integers.
- `min_cost` remains the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given.
- `best_t` remains `n + 1`.
- `t` remains `n + 2`.
- `current_cost` is now 0.
- `length` remains the last element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is 0, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`.**
