The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` impacts the `current_cost` variable by adding the difference between the length of `a` and `t + 1` to `current_cost`. Given that the length of `a` is currently greater than `t + 1`, let's denote the length of `a` as `len(a)`. The updated `current_cost` will be `current_cost + len(a) - (t + 1)`.

- `a` remains unchanged.
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + len(a) - (t + 1)`.
- The conditions `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and currently greater than `t + 1` remain valid.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, the length of `a` is currently greater than `t + 1`, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + len(a) - (t + 1)`**.
