Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is `n + 1`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `length` in the list `a`.
- The loop updates `current_cost` based on whether `length` is less than `t - 1` or greater than `t + 1`.
- As the loop progresses, `t` starts at 1 and increases with each iteration until it reaches the last element of the list `a`, making `t` equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes.
- `current_cost` accumulates the total cost based on the given conditions. Since the loop runs for all elements in the list `a`, `current_cost` reflects the final state after all elements have been processed.
- `min_cost` remains `infinity` unless updated during the loop, but since no update mechanism is provided, it retains its initial value of `infinity`.
- `best_t` remains `-1` because there is no condition to update this variable within the loop.
- `length` will be the last element of the list `a` after the loop completes.
