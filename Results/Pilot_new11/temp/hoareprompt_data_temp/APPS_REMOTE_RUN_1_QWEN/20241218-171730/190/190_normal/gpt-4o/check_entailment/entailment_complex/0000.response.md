Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.
   - The constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and the lengths of the sticks (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) are respected.

2. **Objective Calculation**:
   - The program aims to find the value of \( t \) that minimizes the total cost of making all sticks "almost good" for \( t \).
   - An almost good length for \( t \) means \( |a_i - t| \le 1 \).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each possible \( t \) from 1 to 100, the program calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good.
   - If a stick length \( a_i \) is less than \( t - 1 \), the cost to make it almost good is \( t - 1 - a_i \).
   - If a stick length \( a_i \) is greater than \( t + 1 \), the cost to make it almost good is \( a_i - (t + 1) \).
   - The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding \( t \).

4. **Output**:
   - After iterating through all possible \( t \) values, the program prints the \( t \) that gives the minimum cost and the minimum cost itself.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The program checks all possible \( t \) values from 1 to 100, ensuring that no better solution is missed.
   - The logic for calculating the cost and updating the minimum cost is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Since the program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases without error, it meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
