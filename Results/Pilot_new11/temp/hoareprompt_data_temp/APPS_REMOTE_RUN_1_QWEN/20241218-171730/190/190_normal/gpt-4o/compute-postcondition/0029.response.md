According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to 100 (inclusive) with variable `t`. The key states at the end of the previous iteration are:

- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given
- `best_t` is `n + 1`
- `t` is `n + 1`
- `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given
- `length` is the last element in the list `a`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `t` is currently `n + 1`, it will become `n + 2`.

Let's verify the other states:

- `min_cost` remains unchanged unless the current cost is lower.
- `best_t` remains unchanged.
- `current_cost` remains unchanged unless the current cost is lower.
- `length` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `t` becomes `n + 2`
- All other states remain the same.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`.**
