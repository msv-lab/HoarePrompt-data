The function accepts an integer \(n\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and a list \(a\) of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). It then iterates over all possible values of \(t\) from 1 to 100 to find the value of \(t\) that minimizes the cumulative cost defined as follows: for each element \(length\) in the list \(a\), if \(length < t - 1\), the cost contribution is \(t - 1 - length\); if \(length > t + 1\), the cost contribution is \(length - (t + 1)\). The function prints the value of \(t\) that minimizes the cumulative cost and the minimum cumulative cost itself.
