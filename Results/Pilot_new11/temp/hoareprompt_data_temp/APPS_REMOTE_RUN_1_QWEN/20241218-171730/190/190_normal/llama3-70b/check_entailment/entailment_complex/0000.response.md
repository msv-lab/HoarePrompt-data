Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of sticks \( n \) and their lengths into a list `sticks`.
   
2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `sticks` is sorted, which is necessary to find the median element efficiently.

3. **Initial Cost Calculation**:
   - The median value `mid` is determined by sorting the list and taking the middle element.
   - The initial cost `cost` is calculated by summing the costs of moving each stick to `mid`.

4. **Finding Optimal Central Value**:
   - The program then iterates over a range of possible central values (`mid - 1` to `0` and `mid + 1` to `100`).
   - For each possible central value, it calculates the cost of moving all sticks to that value using the formula `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` to account for the closest possible values.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost (`min_cost`) and the corresponding optimal central value (`min_t`).

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the optimal central value `min_t` and the minimum cost `min_cost`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:

- **Median Handling**: The program correctly considers values around the median, including handling cases where the median itself is one of the elements in the list.
- **Input Range**: The program assumes inputs within the specified range (1 to 100) and does not explicitly handle values outside this range, but this is within the assumption of valid input.
- **Duplicates**: The program does not explicitly handle duplicates, but this does not affect the overall correctness as the goal is to minimize the total cost, and duplicates will contribute similarly to the cost calculation.

Since the program follows the problem description and handles all required aspects without any contradictions or omissions, it is correct.
