Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is `-2` if `length < t - 1`, otherwise `current_cost` is \(2 \times \text{second\_element\_of\_a} - 4\), and `length` is the second element in the list `a`.**
