Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The frog starts at position 0.
   - It can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`.
   - `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers reachable from 0 without going out of the interval `[0, x]`.
   - We need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - `func_1(x, y)` calculates the GCD of `x` and `y`. This is used to simplify the problem by reducing `a` and `b` to their GCD. This step ensures that the jumps can cover all possible positions within the range `[0, m]`.

3. **Recursive Reduction:**
   - `func_2(m, a, b)` handles the main logic.
   - If `a` and `b` share a common factor greater than 1, the problem is simplified by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD. This reduces the problem size.
   - If `a` and `b` have a GCD of 1, the frog can theoretically reach any position up to `a + b - 1` within the interval `[0, m]`.
     - For `m < a + b - 1`, the number of reachable positions is simply the triangular number formula `((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2`.
     - For `m >= a + b - 1`, the sum of reachable positions includes two parts:
       - Positions up to `a + b - 1`: `sum_k = (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.
       - Positions from `a + b` to `m`: `sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum is computed as the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the GCD reduction to simplify the problem.
- The logic for calculating the sum of reachable positions is implemented accurately for both cases (`m < a + b - 1` and `m >= a + b - 1`).
- The function correctly handles the recursive simplification when `a` and `b` share a common factor.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases as specified, the program is correct.
