Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides insights into how the functions operate, but it does not resolve the fundamental issue identified in the original assessment. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( f(i) \)**: The function `func_2` attempts to simplify the problem using the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\), but it does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\). For instance, the example given in the problem description shows that the function should output 14 for the input \(m = 6\), \(a = 4\), and \(b = 5\), but the provided program outputs 10.

2. **Simplification Using GCD**: The approach taken in `func_2` where the function simplifies the problem using the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) and then recursively calls itself does not accurately capture the set of reachable integers. The correct approach would involve considering the set of all reachable integers modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is not correctly handled in the provided code.

3. **Mathematical Expression**: The expressions used in `func_2` do not align with the actual set of reachable integers. For example, the expression \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\) and the subsequent calculation involving `k` do not correctly represent the number of distinct integers the frog can reach.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
