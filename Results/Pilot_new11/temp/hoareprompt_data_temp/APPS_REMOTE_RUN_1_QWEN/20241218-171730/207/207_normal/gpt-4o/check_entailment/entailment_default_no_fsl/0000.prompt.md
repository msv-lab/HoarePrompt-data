You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Functions with output description for each function:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. An edge case to consider is when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function still correctly computes the GCD.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three integers `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It performs the following actions based on the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b` (stored in `g`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by `g` and multiplies the result by `g`. This ensures that `m`, `a`, and `b` are reduced to their coprime form.
2. If the current value of `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), the function returns \(((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as \((a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2\) and `sum_m` as \(m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2\), then returns their sum.

This function effectively computes a specific mathematical expression based on the initial values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, reducing the problem size in the first case and performing calculations in the other cases.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
