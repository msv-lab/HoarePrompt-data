Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not accurately count the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \(i\) in the range from 0 to \(m\). 

The code attempts to build a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i`, but this does not capture the distinct integers the frog can reach. Instead, it accumulates counts, which does not reflect the unique set of reachable integers.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to track the distinct integers reachable from each position and ensure that it sums the distinct counts for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\).

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Use a set to keep track of all distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 up to each \(i\).
2. Iterate through each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\), updating the set with new reachable positions.
3. Sum the sizes of these sets for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\).

The current implementation does not achieve this and thus fails to meet the problem requirements for certain cases.
