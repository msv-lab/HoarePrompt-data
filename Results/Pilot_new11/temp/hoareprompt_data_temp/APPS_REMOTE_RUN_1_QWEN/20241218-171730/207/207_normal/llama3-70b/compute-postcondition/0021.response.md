The code `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp` and prints it. However, the value of `dp` itself does not change; only its sum is printed. The initial state of `dp` is that it is a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (0 ≤ i ≤ m) represents the number of ways to reach the index `i` using the allowed operations of adding `a` and subtracting `b`, starting from `dp[0] = 1`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp` remains unchanged, but the sum of its elements is printed. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged `dp` list and mentions that the sum of `dp` has been printed.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (0 ≤ i ≤ m) is the number of ways to reach the index `i` using the allowed operations of adding `a` and subtracting `b`, starting from `dp[0] = 1`; the sum of `dp` has been printed.**
