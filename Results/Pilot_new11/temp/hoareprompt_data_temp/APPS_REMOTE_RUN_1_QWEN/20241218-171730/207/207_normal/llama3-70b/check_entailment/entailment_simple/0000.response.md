Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description vs. Program Logic**:
   - The problem requires finding the sum of \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from 0 up to \( i \).
   - The provided program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to reach each position from 0 up to \( m \). However, this approach does not directly give the number of distinct integers the frog can reach; it instead counts the number of ways to reach each position.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The array `dp` is initialized with zeros and set `dp[0] = 1` because there's one way to stay at position 0 (starting point).
   - For each position `i` from 0 to \( m \), the program updates `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i - b]` based on the previous positions. This effectively calculates the number of ways to reach each position using the jumps of size `a` and `-b`.

3. **Misinterpretation of `f(i)`**:
   - The `dp` array does not store the number of distinct integers the frog can reach. Instead, it stores the number of ways to reach each position.
   - To get the number of distinct integers the frog can reach up to `i`, you would need to use a set or another data structure to keep track of all unique positions visited, which is not done in the current implementation.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the first example: `m = 7`, `a = 5`, `b = 3`. 
     - Using the provided logic, `dp` would be calculated, but it won't give the correct count of distinct integers. For instance, `f(5)` should be 3 (positions: 0, 5, 2), but the program will give the number of ways to reach each position, which is not the same.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program fails to meet the requirement of counting the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, which is a key part of the problem description.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not fully implement the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
