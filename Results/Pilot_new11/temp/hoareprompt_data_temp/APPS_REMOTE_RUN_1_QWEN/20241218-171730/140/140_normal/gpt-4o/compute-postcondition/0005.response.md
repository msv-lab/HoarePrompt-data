The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Given that `in_degree[v]` is initially either 0 or 1 (since `v` is the next adjacency vertex of `u` and the value is either 0 or 1 based on the precondition), incrementing it by 1 means:

- If `in_degree[v]` was 0, it becomes 1.
- If `in_degree[v]` was 1, it becomes 2.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is now either 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the original value of `in_degree[v]` which was either 0 or 1), `u` is a vertex in `graph`, and `v` is the next adjacency vertex of `u` in `graph`.**
