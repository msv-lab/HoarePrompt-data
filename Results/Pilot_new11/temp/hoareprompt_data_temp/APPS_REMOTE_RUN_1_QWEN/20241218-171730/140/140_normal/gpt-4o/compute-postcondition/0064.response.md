`count` is incremented by 1. The `queue` and its contents, the `node` dequeued from the left, and the changes to the `in_degree` of its neighbors remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is not empty, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 for each neighbor of `node`.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 for each neighbor of `node`.**
