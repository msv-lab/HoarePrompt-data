Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex, `u` is a vertex in `graph`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is 0.
- The loop iterates over each adjacency vertex `v` of a vertex `u` in the `graph`.
- For each iteration, the in-degree of `v` is incremented by 1.
- After all possible iterations of the loop (i.e., when every vertex `u` and its adjacency vertices `v` have been processed), the `in_degree` dictionary will reflect the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for each vertex in the graph.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., the graph has no edges):
- `in_degree` remains as initially defined, with each key (vertex) having a value of 0.
