The code initializes a queue using a list comprehension. It creates a deque containing nodes (vertices) from `in_degree` whose in-degree is 0. This means the queue contains all vertices that have no incoming edges.

Let's denote the initial state variables:
- `graph`: a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex.
- `in_degree`: a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex.
- `u`: a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once.

After the code executes, the queue (`queue`) will contain all vertices with an in-degree of 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex; `u` is a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once; `queue` is a deque containing all vertices with an in-degree of 0.**
