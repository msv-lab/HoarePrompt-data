Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Construction**: The `func_1` function constructs the graph correctly using the provided edges.
2. **Initial Cycle Check**: It first checks if the graph is acyclic by calling `has_cycle(graph)`. If the graph is already acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'.
3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**: For each edge, it temporarily removes the edge and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If removing an edge breaks the cycle, it returns 'YES'.
4. **Final Return**: If no edge can be removed to break the cycle, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function correctly uses Kahn's algorithm to check for cycles in the graph. It initializes the in-degrees of all nodes, processes nodes with zero in-degree, and decrements the in-degrees of their neighbors. If the count of nodes with zero in-degree does not match the total number of nodes, it indicates a cycle.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the code handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or examples where the code would fail based on the problem statement and the given examples. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
