`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The value of `neighbor` is a node in the graph, and the in-degree of this node is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` is updated to include the neighbors whose in-degree has become 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` is updated to include the neighbors whose in-degree has become 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
