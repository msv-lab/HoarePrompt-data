The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. This means that the `neighbor` is added to the end of the `queue`. The `node` is the next node in the queue before this operation, and the `queue` is updated to include the `neighbor`. The `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and the `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the next node in the queue, `queue` includes the neighbor appended at the end, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `count` remains unchanged.**
