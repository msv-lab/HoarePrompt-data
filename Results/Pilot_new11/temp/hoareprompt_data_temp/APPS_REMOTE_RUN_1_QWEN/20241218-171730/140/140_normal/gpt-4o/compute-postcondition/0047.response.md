`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `node` remains the same as it was in the initial state, and the structure of `queue` remains unchanged except that `node` is no longer the first element. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is the first element that was in `queue` before the operation, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element; `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`node` is the first element that was in `queue` before the operation, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element; `count` is increased by 1.**
