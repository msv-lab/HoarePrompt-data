Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the annotations. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**: The code constructs a directed graph using the provided edges, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function uses Kahn's algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. This is a valid approach and matches the problem requirements.
3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**: The main function `func_1` iteratively removes each edge and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement, which requires determining if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.
4. **Annotations**: The annotations accurately reflect the state transitions and the logic implemented in the code. They correctly summarize the operations performed and the conditions checked.

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all required scenarios, the correctness is **True**.
