Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate and is supported by the annotated version of the code. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and constructs the graph using an adjacency list. This is evident from the annotated code where `n`, `m`, and `edges` are properly initialized and passed to `func_1`.

2. **Cycle Detection (`has_cycle` Function)**: The `has_cycle` function uses topological sorting to detect cycles. It correctly initializes the in-degrees and uses a queue to process nodes with zero in-degree, ensuring that if a valid topological ordering exists, it will be detected. The annotated version confirms that this logic is sound.

3. **Edge Removal Check (`func_1` Function)**: The `func_1` function iteratively checks if the graph is acyclic after removing each edge. This approach is valid because it simulates the removal of edges one by one and checks the resulting graph for cycles. The annotated version shows that the program correctly handles the edge removal and cycle detection steps.

4. **Edge Removal Logic**: The program correctly attempts to remove each edge one by one and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If it finds that removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, it returns 'NO'. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Given the detailed annotations and the original assessment, there is no evidence suggesting that the program fails to meet the problem description or behaves incorrectly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
