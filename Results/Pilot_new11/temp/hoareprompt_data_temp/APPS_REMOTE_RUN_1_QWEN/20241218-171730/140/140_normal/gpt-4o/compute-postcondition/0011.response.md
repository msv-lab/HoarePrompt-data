The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `v` is a vertex in the graph, this operation modifies the dictionary `in_degree`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `graph` must have at least one key remaining.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex (with `in_degree[v]` incremented by 1).
- `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key remaining, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex with `in_degree[v]` incremented by 1, `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty.**
