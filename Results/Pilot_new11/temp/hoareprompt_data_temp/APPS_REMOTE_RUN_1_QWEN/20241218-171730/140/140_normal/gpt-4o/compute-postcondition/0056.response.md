Postcondition: ***`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element and possibly includes the neighbor whose in-degree became 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 from its original value. If the in-degree of `neighbor` becomes 0, `queue` includes this neighbor.***
