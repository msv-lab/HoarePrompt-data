To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself:

1. **Given States:**
   - `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that have a directed edge coming out from the key vertex.
   - `visited` is a list where `visited[node]` is `True`.
   - `rec_stack` is an empty list with `rec_stack[node] = True`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for neighbor in graph[node]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `graph[node]`, meaning the node must have outgoing edges.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - The `visited` list indicates that the current `node` has already been visited, which is correct as stated.
   - The `rec_stack` list being non-empty with `rec_stack[node] = True` indicates that this node is currently part of a recursive call stack, which is also correct as stated.
   - However, the loop can only execute if there are neighbors (outgoing edges) from the `node`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` contains at least one element.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The states `node`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` are correctly set as described. The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `graph[node]` is not empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is an empty list with `rec_stack[node] = True`**
