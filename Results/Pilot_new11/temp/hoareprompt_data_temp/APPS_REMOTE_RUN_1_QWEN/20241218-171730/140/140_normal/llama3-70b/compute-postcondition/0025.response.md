`rec_stack[node]` is set to `False`. The value of `visited[node]` remains `True` because the assignment does not affect it. Additionally, the condition mentioned in the precondition does not change because it is based on the values of `visited[neighbor]` and `rec_stack[neighbor]` for the neighbors of `node`, which are not altered by this line of code.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack[node]` is `False`.**
