The code `node = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `node`. Since the initial state is that `queue` is not empty, after executing this line, the first element of `queue` is removed and stored in `node`, and `queue` now contains all the remaining elements.

Output State: **`node` is the first element of `queue`, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element.**
