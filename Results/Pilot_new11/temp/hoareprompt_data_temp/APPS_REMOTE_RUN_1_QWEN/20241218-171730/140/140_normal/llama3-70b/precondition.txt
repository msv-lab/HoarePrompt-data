The function `dfs` takes four parameters: `node` (an integer representing the current node being visited), `graph` (a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes), `visited` (a set of integers representing nodes that have been visited), and `rec_stack` (a set of integers representing nodes in the current recursion stack).
