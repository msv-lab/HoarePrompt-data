Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to consider the scenario where a graph with exactly one cycle can be made acyclic by removing a specific edge. Specifically, the provided solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles but does not account for the possibility of making the graph acyclic by removing a single edge within a detected cycle.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
1 3
2 4
```

In this graph, there are two cycles: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` and `1 -> 3`. The program will correctly identify that the graph contains cycles. However, it will incorrectly output 'NO' because it does not check if removing any single edge from these cycles can make the graph acyclic.

To fix this, the program needs to check if removing any single edge from the detected cycle(s) can make the graph acyclic. This requires additional logic to verify if the graph remains cyclic after each possible edge removal.
