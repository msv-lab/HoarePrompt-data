The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

The function constructs a directed graph using the provided edges. It then checks if the graph contains a cycle using the `has_cycle(graph)` function. If the graph contains no cycle initially, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iterates over each edge in the graph, temporarily removing the edge and checking if the graph still contains a cycle. If removing an edge breaks the cycle, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found and the graph remains cyclic, it returns 'NO'.

This function effectively determines whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing a single directed edge. The final state of the program after executing the function is either 'YES', indicating that a single edge can be removed to break all cycles, or 'NO', indicating that no single edge can be removed to break all cycles.
