The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. This operation does not affect the value of `node`, `in_degree[neighbor]`, or `count`. Therefore, the only change is that `neighbor` is added to `queue`.

Output State: **`node` is the node that was dequeued, `queue` is the updated queue with `neighbor` appended, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, and `count` is increased by the number of neighbors whose in_degree becomes 0.**
