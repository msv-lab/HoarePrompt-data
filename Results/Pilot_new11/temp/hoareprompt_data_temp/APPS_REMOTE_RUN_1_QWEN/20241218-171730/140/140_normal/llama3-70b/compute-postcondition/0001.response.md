`rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the node is now marked as being part of the current recursive call stack. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that have a directed edge coming out from the key vertex; `visited` is a list where `visited[node]` is `True`; `rec_stack` is an empty list with `rec_stack[node] = True`.**
