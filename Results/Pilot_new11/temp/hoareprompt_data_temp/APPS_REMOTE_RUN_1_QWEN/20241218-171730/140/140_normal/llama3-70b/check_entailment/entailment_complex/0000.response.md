Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - The program constructs the graph using adjacency lists (`graph`). Each vertex is mapped to a list of its outgoing edges. This is done correctly from the input data.

2. **Cycle Detection with DFS**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles. It uses two lists, `visited` and `rec_stack`, to track visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack, respectively.
   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS, `func_1` returns `True`. If no cycle is detected, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each node, the program calls `func_1` to check if there is a cycle starting from that node.
   - If a cycle is detected, it prints 'NO' because the graph cannot be made acyclic by removing just one edge.
   - If no cycle is detected for any node, it prints 'YES' because the graph is already acyclic or can be made acyclic by removing one edge.

4. **Edge Removal**:
   - The program checks up to \( n \) times (one for each node), which is sufficient to ensure that a cycle can be detected even if it involves multiple edges.

### Cases Covered:
- **No Cycle**: If the graph is acyclic, the program will detect it and print 'YES'.
- **Single Edge Removal Makes Graph Acyclic**: If there is a cycle involving exactly one edge, the program will detect it and print 'NO'.
- **Multiple Cycles or More Complex Cases**: Since the program checks each node and its adjacent nodes, it can detect cycles involving different edges and determine if the graph can become acyclic by removing one edge.

Thus, the program correctly identifies whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, meeting the problem description.
