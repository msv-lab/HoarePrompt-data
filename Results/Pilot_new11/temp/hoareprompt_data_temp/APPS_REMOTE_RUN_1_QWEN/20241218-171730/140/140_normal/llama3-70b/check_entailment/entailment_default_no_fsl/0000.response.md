Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses a single call to `func_1` to check for cycles in the graph. However, the problem description states that we are allowed to remove at most one edge to make the graph acyclic. The current implementation only checks if the graph contains a cycle and does not attempt to remove any edges to see if the graph becomes acyclic after the removal.

To fix this, the code needs to:
1. Attempt to remove each edge and check if the resulting graph is acyclic.
2. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, then print "YES".
3. If no single edge removal makes the graph acyclic, then print "NO".

The current implementation only checks for cycles and does not account for the possibility of making the graph acyclic by removing a single edge. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
