`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `node` and the state of the `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is the value that was at the front of the queue and removed, `queue` is the original queue with the front element removed, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`node` is the value that was at the front of the queue and removed, `queue` is the original queue with the front element removed, `count` is increased by 1**
