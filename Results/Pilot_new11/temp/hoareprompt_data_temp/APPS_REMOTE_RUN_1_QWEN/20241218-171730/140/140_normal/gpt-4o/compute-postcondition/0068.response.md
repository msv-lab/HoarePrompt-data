`queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` node to the right side of the `queue`. The `queue` was not empty before this operation, and now it contains one additional element, which is the `neighbor` node. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty and now includes the neighbor node, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and the in-degree of `neighbor` is now 0**
