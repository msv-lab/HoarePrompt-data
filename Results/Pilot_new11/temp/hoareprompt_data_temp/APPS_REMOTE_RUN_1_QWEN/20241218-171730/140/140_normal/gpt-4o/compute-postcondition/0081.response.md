The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex. The function returns `count != n` where `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 and `n` is the total number of nodes in the graph.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph, returns `count != n` where `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 and `n` is the total number of nodes in the graph.**
