`times` is sorted in ascending order, which means the elements within the list `times` are rearranged. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is not yet defined.
