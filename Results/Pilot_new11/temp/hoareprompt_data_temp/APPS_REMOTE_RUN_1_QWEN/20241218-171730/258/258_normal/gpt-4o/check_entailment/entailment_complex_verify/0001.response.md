Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version provides further insight into the program's behavior, and it confirms that the function `func_1` only checks combinations of two meat pieces at a time. This approach is insufficient because the optimal heat source location might involve more than two meat pieces, especially in cases where the pieces are not aligned in a simple linear fashion.

The provided test case demonstrates this issue:
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 10
```

In this case, the optimal solution involves placing the heat source in a way that minimizes the distance to at least three meat pieces. The current implementation of `func_1` cannot handle this scenario effectively because it only considers pairs of meat pieces. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is not correct.
