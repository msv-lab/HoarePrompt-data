According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i + 1` and `N`. The loop will continue if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `cy`, `dx` are as defined. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `N`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` must still be less than `N`.

The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j` is `j + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `cy`, `dx` are as defined. `N` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
