The code snippet `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state where `x` is -999 and `y` is -997, the function `func_2(-999, -997, -999, -997)` will be called and its return value will be assigned to `times`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `times` from this information alone. However, we know that `times` will be updated to this new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -997, `times` is `func_2(-999, -997, -999, -997)`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
