The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables; it only controls the flow of the loop. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` remains unchanged, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `cx` remains unchanged, `cy` is equal to \((y1 + y2) / 2\)**.
