Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` obtained from calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for every combination of `x` and `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, `x` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and `times` is a list of sorted values returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each combination of `x` and `y`.**
