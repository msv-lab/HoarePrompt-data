The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we assume this `continue` statement is part of a loop structure that would normally iterate over the `meats` list. However, without the loop structure, the `continue` statement alone does not change any variable values or conditions.

Given the initial state and the presence of the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged because the `continue` statement itself does not alter any variable values or introduce new conditions.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq \text{len(meats)}\), `T` is a non-negative float representing the time threshold, `N` is the length of the `meats` list and must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are either the first three elements of the tuple at index `i` or `j` in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the remaining tuple elements, `d` is now \(\frac{T * (c1 - c2)}{c1 * c2}\), `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + dy^2\), `mx` is \(cx + dy \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}\), `my` is \(cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}\), `count` is an integer representing the number of tuples in `meats` where the distance from \((mx, my)\) to \((x, y)\) is less than or equal to \(T\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\)**
