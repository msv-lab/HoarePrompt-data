The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. Given the initial state, the list `meats` initially contains one element, which is the tuple `(x, integer value of `data[6]`, `c)`. After executing the code, this tuple will remain in the list, and a new tuple `(x, y, c)` will be added to the list.

- The variable `K` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The variable `meats` now contains two elements: the original tuple and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`.
- The variables `data`, `N`, `index`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing two elements which are the tuple (`x`, integer value of `data[6]`, `c`) and the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[7]`**
