The code updates the value of `dy` to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Previously, `dy` was an unchanged variable. The values of other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `cx` remains unchanged, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
