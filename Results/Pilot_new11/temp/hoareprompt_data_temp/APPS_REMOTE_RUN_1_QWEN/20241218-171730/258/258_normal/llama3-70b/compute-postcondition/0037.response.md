`K` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet. However, we know that `ans` is the K-1th element of `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`. Since `K` is not specified, let's consider the possible values of `K` (1, 2, 3, 4) and determine the value of `ans` accordingly. The value of `times[K - 1]` will be the same as `ans` for the respective `K`.

If `K` is 1, `ans` is the first element of `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`, which is `-998`.
If `K` is 2, `ans` is the second element of `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`, which is `-998`.
If `K` is 3, `ans` is the third element of `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`, which is `-997`.
If `K` is 4, `ans` is the fourth element of `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`, which is `-997`.

The code updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Without knowing the exact value of `K`, we consider the worst-case scenario where `ans` could be updated if `times[K - 1]` is less than the current `ans`.

Since `times` is `[-998, -998, -997, -997]`, the minimum value in `times` is `-998`. Therefore, `ans` will not be updated if `K` is 1 or 2 because the current `ans` is already `-998` or `-998`. If `K` is 3 or 4, `ans` will be updated to `-997`.

Given this, we can conclude:

- If `K` is 1 or 2, `ans` remains `-998`.
- If `K` is 3 or 4, `ans` is updated to `-997`.

However, since the problem does not specify the value of `K`, we need to provide a general answer based on the possible values of `K`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -997, `times` is [-998, -998, -997, -997]; ans is -998 if K is 1 or 2, otherwise ans is -997.**
