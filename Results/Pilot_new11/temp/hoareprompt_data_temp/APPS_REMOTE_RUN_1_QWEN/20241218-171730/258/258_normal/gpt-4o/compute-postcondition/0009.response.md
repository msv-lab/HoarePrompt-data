The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. Given the initial state:

- `K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`
- `meats` is an empty list
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `index` is 2
- `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`

After executing the code, `meats` will contain the tuple `(x, y, c)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
