The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and no loop context is provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables. All the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `N`; `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`; `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`; `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`; `y2` is `meats[j][1]`; `c2` is `meats[j][2]`; `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\); `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\); `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}`**
