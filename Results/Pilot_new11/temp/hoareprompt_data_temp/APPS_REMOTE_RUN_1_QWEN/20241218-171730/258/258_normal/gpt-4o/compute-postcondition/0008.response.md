The code `c = int(data[index + 2])` assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` converted to an integer to the variable `c`. Given the initial state:

- `K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`
- `meats` is an empty list
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `index` is 2
- `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`

The variable `c` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, which is `data[2 + 2]` or `data[4]` (since `index` is 2). The value of `c` is the integer conversion of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
