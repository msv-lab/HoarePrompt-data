Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented by tuples `(x_i, y_i, c_i)`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and checks if there exists a combination where the count of meat pieces within a distance `T` from a specific calculated point is greater than or equal to `K`. If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes the length of the `meats` list as `N`.
2. Iterates over all pairs of meat pieces `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
3. For each pair, it swaps the meat pieces if the hardness of the first piece is less than the hardness of the second piece.
4. Calculates the distance `d` between the two pieces based on their hardness and time threshold.
5. If the distance `d` is negative or zero, it continues to the next iteration.
6. Computes the midpoint `cx` and `cy` between the two pieces, and the differences `dx` and `dy`.
7. Calculates the squared distance `d2` between the two pieces.
8. Checks if the calculated point `(mx, my)` lies within a certain distance from the midpoint.
9. Counts the number of meat pieces within the distance `T` from the calculated point `(mx, my)`.
10. If the count is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`.

If no valid combination is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `meats` is a non-empty list and `K` is within the bounds of the list length.
- If all meat pieces have the same hardness and the time threshold `T` is not considered in the calculations, the function might not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle the case where the list `meats` is empty, which should result in an immediate return of `False`.
- The function does not account for the possibility that `K` could be `1`, which means it only needs to find one meat piece within the distance `T` from the calculated point.

After the function concludes, it will return either `True` or `False` based on whether a valid combination of meat pieces was found.**
