The given code snippet calculates `mx` using the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. However, before this calculation, the code checks the condition `d * d2 > d2`. Since `d` and `d2` are both 0 in the initial state, the condition `d * d2 > d2` evaluates to `0 * 0 > 0`, which is `False`. As a result, the if part does not execute, and the value of `mx` is not updated. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0, `mx` is not updated.**
