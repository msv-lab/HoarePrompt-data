The code `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2` assigns the value of \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\) to `dx`. The previous value of `dx` is not relevant since it is being reassigned. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]` (or `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]` (if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `d` is \(\frac{c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T}{c1 \cdot c2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathbf{math.sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d^2)}}{d2}`, `count` remains unchanged, `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\)**
