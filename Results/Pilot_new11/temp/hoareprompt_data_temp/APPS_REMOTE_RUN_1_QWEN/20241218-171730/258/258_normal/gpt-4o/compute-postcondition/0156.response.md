Postcondition: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is \((c1_val - c2_val) * T / (c1_val * c2_val)\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `cx`, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`, `c1_val` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2_val` is `meats[N][2]`, and the if condition \(d * d2 > d2\) is true.**
