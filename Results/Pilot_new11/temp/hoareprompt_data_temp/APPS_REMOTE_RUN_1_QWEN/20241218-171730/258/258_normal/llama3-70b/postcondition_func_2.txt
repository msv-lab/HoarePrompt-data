The function `func_3` iterates over all possible integer coordinates (x, y) within the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. For each coordinate pair, it calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to obtain a list of cooking times for a piece of meat when heated at that specific location. These lists of cooking times are then sorted. The function keeps track of the minimum value among the K-th largest elements from these sorted lists. After completing the iteration, it returns this minimum value. Potential edge cases include the scenarios where `K` is larger than the length of the list `times`, in which case the K-th largest element might not exist. Additionally, the function assumes that `func_2` returns a non-empty list of cooking times for each (x, y) pair. If `func_2` ever returns an empty list, the function will incorrectly handle the subsequent operations.
