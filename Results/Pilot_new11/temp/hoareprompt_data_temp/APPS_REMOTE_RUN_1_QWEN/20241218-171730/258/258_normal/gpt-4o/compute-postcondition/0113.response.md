The initial state includes the calculation of `dx` and `dy` based on the initial coordinates `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. The value of `d2` is also predefined. The variable `my` is updated using the formula:

\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2} \]

Given this, we can substitute the values:

1. `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
2. `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
3. `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)

Thus, the updated value of `my` is:

\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2} \]

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
