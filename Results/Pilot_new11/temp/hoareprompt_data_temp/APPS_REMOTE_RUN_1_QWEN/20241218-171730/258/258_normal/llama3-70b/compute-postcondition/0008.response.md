The function `func_2` is called twice, and both calls return the same value, which is the sorted list of the arguments provided: `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`. The sorted list remains the same in both calls, so `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]` and `times` is also `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`.

The code snippet `times.sort()` sorts the list in-place. Since the list is already sorted, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, after the sort operation, the list remains `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`**
