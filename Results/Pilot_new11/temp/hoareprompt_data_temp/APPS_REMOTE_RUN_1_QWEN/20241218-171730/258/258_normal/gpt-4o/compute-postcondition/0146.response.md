The code snippet calculates the difference `d` using the formula `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since `c1 * T - c2 * T` simplifies to `(c1 - c2) * T`, the value of `d` will be `(c1 - c2) * T`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `d` is assigned the value `(c1 - c2) * T`.
2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `d` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`.**
