Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`***

Since the else part is not present, the postcondition directly follows the if part. The if condition ensures that the values of `x1, y1, c1` are swapped with `x2, y2, c2` when `c1 * T < c2 * T` is true. Given that the else part does not provide any additional changes, the overall postcondition is as described above.
