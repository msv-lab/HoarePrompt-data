The code assigns the value `2` to the variable `index`. The previous values of the other variables (`K`, `meats`, `data`, `N`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `index` is 2**
