Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program discretizes the coordinates to integers ranging from -1000 to 1000, which does not account for all possible real-number coordinates. Given the constraints and the problem description, the optimal solution could involve non-integer coordinates. The output hints confirm that the program only considers integer coordinates, which means it might not find the true minimum time required to grill K or more pieces of meat. Therefore, the program's approach is flawed, and it cannot guarantee correctness for all inputs.
