The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. It initializes `ans` to positive infinity and then iterates over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000. For each combination, it calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to obtain a list of cooking times for each piece of meat when the heat source is placed at coordinates `(x, y)`. From these lists, it extracts the K-th largest element and updates `ans` with the minimum value among these K-th largest elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, initializes `ans` to positive infinity, and returns `ans`, which is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` obtained from calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for every combination of `x` and `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000.**
