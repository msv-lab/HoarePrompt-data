    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `N`, `j` is `N - 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][0]`, `y2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][1]`, `c2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance \(T\) from the calculated point \((mx, my)\) if a valid combination is found, otherwise `count` is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared. If no valid combination is found, the function returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented by tuples `(x_i, y_i, c_i)`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and checks if there exists a combination where the count of meat pieces within a distance `T` from a specific calculated point is greater than or equal to `K`. If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes the length of the `meats` list as `N`.
2. Iterates over all pairs of meat pieces `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
3. For each pair, it swaps the meat pieces if the hardness of the first piece is less than the hardness of the second piece.
4. Calculates the distance `d` between the two pieces based on their hardness and time threshold.
5. If the distance `d` is negative or zero, it continues to the next iteration.
6. Computes the midpoint `cx` and `cy` between the two pieces, and the differences `dx` and `dy`.
7. Calculates the squared distance `d2` between the two pieces.
8. Checks if the calculated point `(mx, my)` lies within a certain distance from the midpoint.
9. Counts the number of meat pieces within the distance `T` from the calculated point `(mx, my)`.
10. If the count is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`.

If no valid combination is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `meats` is a non-empty list and `K` is within the bounds of the list length.
- If all meat pieces have the same hardness and the time threshold `T` is not considered in the calculations, the function might not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle the case where the list `meats` is empty, which should result in an immediate return of `False`.
- The function does not account for the possibility that `K` could be `1`, which means it only needs to find one meat piece within the distance `T` from the calculated point.

After the function concludes, it will return either `True` or `False` based on whether a valid combination of meat pieces was found.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) of the i-th piece of meat and its hardness \(c_i\) such that -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `low` and `high` are extremely close to each other, and `mid` is also very close to them. The exact value depends on the outcome of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`, and `low` and `high` will converge to a value such that `high - low < 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is very close to low and mid, with the condition that high - low < 1e-07
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) of the i-th piece of meat and its hardness \(c_i\) such that -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` that satisfies the condition `high - low < 1e-07`.

After the function concludes, the program state is as follows:
- The function calls another function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` within a loop, adjusting the range between `low` and `high` based on the return value of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
- The loop continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than 1e-07.
- The final value returned by the function is `high`, which is very close to `low` and `mid`, ensuring that `high - low < 1e-07`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `N` or `K` are out of the specified bounds (i.e., `K > N` or `N > 60`), the function should ideally raise an error or handle it appropriately, although the current code does not explicitly check these conditions.
- If the list `meats` is empty, the function would still execute but would need to handle this case, possibly raising an error or returning a default value.
- If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` does not return a boolean value or behaves unexpectedly, the function may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= N <= 60. meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, with -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100.

    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads two integers `N` and `K` from user input, followed by `N` tuples each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of a piece of meat. It then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs to process the data and calculates a result. Finally, it prints the result formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges, which would raise errors if not handled externally. If `func_2` is not defined or does not return a numeric value, the function will print an unexpected output or error message.
