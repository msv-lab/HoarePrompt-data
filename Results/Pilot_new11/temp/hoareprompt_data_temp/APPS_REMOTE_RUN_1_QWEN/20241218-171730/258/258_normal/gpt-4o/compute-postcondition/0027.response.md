Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads two integers `N` and `K` from user input, followed by `N` tuples each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of a piece of meat. It then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs to process the data and calculates a result. Finally, it prints the result formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges, which would raise errors if not handled externally. If `func_2` is not defined or does not return a numeric value, the function will print an unexpected output or error message.**
