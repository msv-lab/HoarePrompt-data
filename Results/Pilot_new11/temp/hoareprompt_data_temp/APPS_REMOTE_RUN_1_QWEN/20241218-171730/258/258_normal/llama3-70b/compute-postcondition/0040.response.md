The `times` variable is a result of a function call `func_2(-998, -996, -998, -996)`. After the function call, the value of `times` is sorted using the `sort()` method. Sorting does not return a new list but sorts the list in place. Therefore, the value of `times` is sorted in ascending order.

Given the initial values, the exact elements of `times` are not specified, but we know they are `-998` and `-996`. Sorting these two values will keep them in their original order because `-998` is less than `-996`. Hence, the sorted list remains `[-998, -996]`.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -996], `ans` is -998 if `K` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ans` is -997**
