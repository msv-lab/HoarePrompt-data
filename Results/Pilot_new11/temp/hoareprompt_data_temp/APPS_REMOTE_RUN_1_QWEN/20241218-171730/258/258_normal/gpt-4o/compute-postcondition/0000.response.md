The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The initial states of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, and the list `meats` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= N <= 60; `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, with -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100; `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input.**
