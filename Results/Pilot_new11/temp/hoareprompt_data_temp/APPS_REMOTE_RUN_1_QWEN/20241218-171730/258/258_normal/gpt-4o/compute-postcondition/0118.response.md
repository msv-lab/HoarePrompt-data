The code snippet updates the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` to be the values of `meats[i][0]`, `meats[i][1]`, and `meats[i][2]`, respectively. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` remains unchanged, `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathbf{math.sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d^2)}}{d2}`, `count` remains unchanged.**
