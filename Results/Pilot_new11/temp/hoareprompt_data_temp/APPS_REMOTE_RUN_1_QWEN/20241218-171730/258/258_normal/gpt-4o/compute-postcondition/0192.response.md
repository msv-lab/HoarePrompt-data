The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables or their values. All the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `dx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)\), `dy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)\), `d2` is \(\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\), `cx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\right)\), `cy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\right)\), `my` is \(cy - dx \cdot \sqrt{\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right) \cdot d - d^2} / \left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\).
