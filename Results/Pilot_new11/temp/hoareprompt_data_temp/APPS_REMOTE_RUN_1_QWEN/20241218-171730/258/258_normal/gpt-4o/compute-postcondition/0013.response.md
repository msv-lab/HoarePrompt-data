The code snippet `y = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to `y`. Given the initial state, we know that `index` is 5, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[6]`.

From the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input.
- `data[6]` is a string that needs to be converted to an integer.

After executing the code, `y` will be assigned the integer value of `data[6]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`.
- `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`).
- `data` remains the same.
- `N` must be greater than 1.
- `index` is 5.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`.
- `y` is now the integer value of `data[6]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, integer value of `data[6]`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
