The code updates `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `times` is a list containing `-998` and `-996`, and `K` can be either 1 or 2:

- If `K` is 1, `times[K - 1]` (which is `times[0]`) is `-998`.
- If `K` is 2, `times[K - 1]` (which is `times[1]`) is `-996`.

In both cases, `ans` will be updated to the smaller value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- If `K` is 1, `ans` is `-998`.
- If `K` is 2, `ans` is `-997`.

Let's consider each case separately:

1. If `K` is 1:
   - Current `ans` is `-998`.
   - `times[K - 1]` is `-998`.
   - `ans` will remain `-998` because `-998` is equal to `-998`.
   
2. If `K` is 2:
   - Current `ans` is `-997`.
   - `times[K - 1]` is `-996`.
   - `ans` will be updated to `-996` because `-996` is less than `-997`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `K`:

- If `K` is 1, the output state is: `x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -996], `ans` is -998.
- If `K` is 2, the output state is: `x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -996], `ans` is -996.

Output State: **If `K` is 1: `x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -996], `ans` is -998; If `K` is 2: `x` is -998, `y` is -996, `times` is [-998, -996], `ans` is -996**.
