Output State: **`K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= N <= 60; `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, with -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100; `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`**
