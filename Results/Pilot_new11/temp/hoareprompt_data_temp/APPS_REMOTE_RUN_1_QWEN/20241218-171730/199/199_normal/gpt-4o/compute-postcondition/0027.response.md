Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). If `n` is less than 6, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of `a` from 1 to \(n//4\), setting `b` to the same value as `a`. It then calculates `rem` as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) and checks if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If these conditions are met, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.**

This covers all potential cases as per the code, including the edge case where `n` is less than 6, and the missing logic of setting `a` and `b` to undefined after the loop completes, which does not affect the return value.
