`ways` is incremented by 1, so its new value is its previous value plus 1. The values of `a`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 7 is also preserved.

Output State: **`ways` is a positive integer greater than 1 (specifically, one more than its previous value), `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, and `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\)**
