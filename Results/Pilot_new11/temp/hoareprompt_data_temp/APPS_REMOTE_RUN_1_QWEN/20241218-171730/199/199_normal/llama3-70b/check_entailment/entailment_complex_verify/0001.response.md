Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square. The annotations indicate that the function iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the specified ranges and checks the conditions to ensure a valid pair is counted. 

The original assessment was marked as **False** because it was suggested that the current implementation might miss some valid combinations due to the constraints on `a` and `b`. However, the provided annotated version clarifies that the inner loop for `b` iterates up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, which indeed ensures that all valid pairs are considered. Therefore, the original assessment was based on a misunderstanding of the code logic. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles all necessary cases, making the original assessment inaccurate.
