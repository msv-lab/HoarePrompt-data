Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the remaining length after choosing `a` and `b` cannot be evenly divided into two equal parts, which is a requirement for forming a rectangle but not a square. For example, consider the input `10`. According to the problem description, valid splits should include `{1, 3, 3, 3}`, `{2, 2, 3, 3}`, etc., but the current implementation does not account for these cases. Specifically, the condition `rem % 2 == 0` only checks if the remaining length is even, but it does not ensure that the remaining length can be split into two different positive integers. This results in missing some valid cases. For instance, `{1, 3, 3, 3}` would be missed because `rem` would be `4`, and `4 % 2 == 0` is true, but `rem // 2` equals `2`, which is not distinct from `b` if `b` is also `2`.
