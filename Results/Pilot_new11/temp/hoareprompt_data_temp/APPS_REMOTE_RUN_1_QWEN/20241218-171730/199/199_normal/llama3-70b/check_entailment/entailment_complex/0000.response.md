Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a positive integer `n` from the standard input and passes it to the function `func_1`. The input is assumed to be valid within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b` where \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\).
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), it checks if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `ways` counter.
   - The condition \(a \neq b\) ensures that no square is formed, as all sides of a square must be equal.
   - The condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) ensures that the sum of the two parts equals half the total length of the stick, making the other two parts of the stick also sum up to \(a + b\), thus forming a rectangle.

3. **Output**: The function returns the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions, which corresponds to the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the constraints appropriately, it is correct.
