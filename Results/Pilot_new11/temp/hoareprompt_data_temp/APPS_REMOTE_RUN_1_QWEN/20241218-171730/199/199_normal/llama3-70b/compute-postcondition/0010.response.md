The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` can be either 2 or 1, so after incrementing, `ways` will be 3 if it was initially 2, and 2 if it was initially 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ways` is either 3 or 2, `a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`**
