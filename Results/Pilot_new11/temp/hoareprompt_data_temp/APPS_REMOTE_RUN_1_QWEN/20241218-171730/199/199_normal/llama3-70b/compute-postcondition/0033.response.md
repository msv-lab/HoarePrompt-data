Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 7.
   - `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - The loop body checks if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - If the condition is met, `ways` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the original value of `ways` is retained.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `ways` is still either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is still 3.
   - `n` is still at least 7.
   - `b` is now \(b_{\text{current}} + 1\).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be within the range specified by the loop.
   - The next value of `b` would be \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\).

5. **Loop Range Calculation:**
   - The upper limit of the loop is \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - Substituting \(a = 3\):
     \[
     \text{Upper limit} = \left(\frac{n - 3}{2}\right) + 1 = \frac{n - 1}{2}
     \]

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `ways` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.
   - `a` remains 3.
   - `n` remains at least 7.
   - `b` becomes \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`ways` is either 0, 1, or a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, and `b` is \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\)**.
