`ways` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `ways` becomes its previous value plus 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `n` remains at least 7. Therefore, the Output State is: `ways` is increased by 1, `a` remains 3, `n` remains at least 7, `b` remains \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\).

Output State: **`ways` is increased by 1, `a` remains 3, `n` remains at least 7, `b` remains \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\)**.
