    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions inside the loop, `a` is undefined, `b` is undefined, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions inside the loop, where `a` and `b` are undefined, and `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` being greater than 0 and even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). If `n` is less than 6, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of `a` from 1 to \(n//4\), setting `b` to the same value as `a`. It then calculates `rem` as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) and checks if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If these conditions are met, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
