`ways` is incremented by 1 because the code `ways += 1` adds 1 to the current value of `ways`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be at least 7 and that the current value of `b` satisfies \(2 \times (3 + b) = n\) and \(3 \neq b\) still holds.

Output State: **`ways` is either 1 or a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop, and the current value of `b` satisfies \(2 \times (3 + b) = n\) and \(3 \neq b**.
