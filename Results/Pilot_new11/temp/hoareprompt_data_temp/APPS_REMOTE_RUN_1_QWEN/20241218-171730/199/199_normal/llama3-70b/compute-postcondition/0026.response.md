Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - The loop variable `b` ranges from `a` to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - `a` is already given as 3.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `b` in the specified range.
   - The range for `b` is from `a` to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

3. **Calculate the Range of `b`:**
   - The minimum value of `b` is `a`, which is 3.
   - The maximum value of `b` is \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

4. **Check if the Range is Valid:**
   - To ensure there is at least one valid `b`, we need to check if the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1]\) contains at least one integer.
   - This requires \((n - a) // 2 + 1\) to be greater than or equal to `a`.

5. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - Simplify \((n - a) // 2 + 1 \geq a\):
     \[
     (n - 3) // 2 + 1 \geq 3
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the division:
     \[
     n - 3 + 2 \geq 6 \implies n - 1 \geq 6 \implies n \geq 7
     \]

6. **State the Final Adjusted State:**
   - The initial values are `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 7.
   - The variable `b` will take on the value of the last `b` checked in the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
**`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, and `b` will be the last value of `b` checked in the loop.**

State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 3, `n` must be at least 7, `b` will be the last value of `b` checked in the loop**
