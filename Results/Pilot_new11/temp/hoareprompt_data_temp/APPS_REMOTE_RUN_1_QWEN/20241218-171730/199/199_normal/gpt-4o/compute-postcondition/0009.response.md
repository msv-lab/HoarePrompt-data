`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\). The value of `rem` remains \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` being greater than 0 and even. The values of `a` and `b` remain undefined, and the condition that the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2` still holds.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even, `a` is undefined, `b` is undefined, and the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`**
