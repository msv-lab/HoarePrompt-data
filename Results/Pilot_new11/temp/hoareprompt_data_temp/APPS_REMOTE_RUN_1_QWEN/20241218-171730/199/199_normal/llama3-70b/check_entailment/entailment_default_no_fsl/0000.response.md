Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code only checks for pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a < b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), which means it assumes that the third and fourth parts of the stick will automatically be \(n - 2(a + b)\) and \(n - 2(a + b) - b\). However, the problem requires forming a rectangle with four distinct parts, meaning all four parts must be different integers.

For example, consider the input `20`. The correct output should be `4`, corresponding to the partitions `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the provided code does not generate these partitions because it incorrectly assumes that if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), then the other two parts can be derived directly without ensuring all parts are distinct.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that all four parts are distinct integers and form a rectangle. This can be achieved by generating all possible combinations of four distinct parts that sum up to \(n\) and checking if they can form a rectangle but not a square.
