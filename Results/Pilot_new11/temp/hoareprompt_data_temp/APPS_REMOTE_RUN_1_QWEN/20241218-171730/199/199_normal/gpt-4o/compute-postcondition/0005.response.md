The code `b = a` attempts to assign the value of `a` to `b`. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, the assignment cannot be performed, and the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is 0, `b` is undefined**
