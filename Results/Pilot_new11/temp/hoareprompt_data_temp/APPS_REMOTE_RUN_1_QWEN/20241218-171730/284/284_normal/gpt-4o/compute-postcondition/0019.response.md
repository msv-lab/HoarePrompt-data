Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25.
   - `i` has been increased by 6 in the previous iteration.
   - The condition \((i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x\) holds true.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as \(i * i \leq x\).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body checks if `x % (i + 6) == 0` or `x % (i + 8) == 0`.
   - If either condition is true, the function returns False and the loop terminates.
   - If neither condition is true, the function does not return anything, meaning `x` remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 6 again.
   - The new condition to check for the next iteration is \((i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x\).

5. **Determining the State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that the condition \((i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x\) holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is increased by 6, the new value of \(i\) will be \(i + 6\).
   - Therefore, the new condition becomes \(((i + 6) + 6) * ((i + 6) + 6) \leq x\), which simplifies to \((i + 12) * (i + 12) \leq x\).

Given the constraints and the need for the loop to continue, we must ensure that the new condition \((i + 12) * (i + 12) \leq x\) holds true. This means that `x` must be at least \((i + 12)^2\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must be at least \((i + 12)^2\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and `x` must be at least \((i + 12)^2\)**
