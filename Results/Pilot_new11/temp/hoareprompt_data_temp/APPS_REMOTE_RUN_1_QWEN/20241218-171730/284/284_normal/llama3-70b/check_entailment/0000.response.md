Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given \( n \). The program checks each value of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. If it finds a value of \( m \) for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints that value of \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
