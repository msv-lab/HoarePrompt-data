Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through possible values of `m` (from 1 to 1000) and checks if the expression `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the function `func_1`.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, it means `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, and the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks for the primality of `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000):
     - If `x` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
     - If `x` is between 1 and 3, it returns `True`.
     - If `x` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
     - For other values of `x` greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it uses a more efficient method to check for primality by checking divisibility up to the square root of `x` with specific step sizes.

4. **Guaranteed Existence of Counterexample**:
   - According to the problem description, there exists some `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. Since the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers, the program will eventually find such an `m` and print it.

5. **Range and Output**:
   - The program ensures that the output `m` is within the specified range (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), as required by the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis for any given `n`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
