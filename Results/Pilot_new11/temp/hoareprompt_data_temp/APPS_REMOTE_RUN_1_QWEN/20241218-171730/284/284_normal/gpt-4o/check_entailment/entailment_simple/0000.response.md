Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Here’s why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` as input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Over Possible Values of `m`**: The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is a prime number using the `func_1` function.

3. **Prime Number Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles edge cases:
     - If `x` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
     - If `x` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
     - If `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
     - For larger values of `x`, it uses a more efficient algorithm to check primality. Specifically, it checks divisibility up to the square root of `x`, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.

4. **Output**: Once a non-prime value is found, the program prints the corresponding `m` and exits the loop.

Given these points, the program ensures that for any valid input `n`, it will find and print an appropriate `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, thus proving PolandBall's hypothesis false.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
