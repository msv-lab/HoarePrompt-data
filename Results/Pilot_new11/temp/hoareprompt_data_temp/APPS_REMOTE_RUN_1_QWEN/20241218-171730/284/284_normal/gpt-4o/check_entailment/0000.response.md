Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It checks for each \( m \) from 1 to 1000 whether \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds such an \( m \), it prints the value of \( m \) and stops the loop. The `func_1` function correctly determines if a number is prime according to the standard definition. Since it guarantees that an answer exists and the program is designed to find and print such an \( m \), the program satisfies the requirements for all inputs within the specified range.
