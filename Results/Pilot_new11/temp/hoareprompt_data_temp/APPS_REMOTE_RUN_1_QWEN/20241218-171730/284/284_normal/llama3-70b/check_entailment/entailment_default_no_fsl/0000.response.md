Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and uses the `func_1` function to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number. If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime, the program prints `m` and breaks the loop. 

The `func_1` function correctly checks for primality by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number being checked. If any divisor is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For any valid input `n` within the range [1, 1000], the program will find and print a suitable `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
