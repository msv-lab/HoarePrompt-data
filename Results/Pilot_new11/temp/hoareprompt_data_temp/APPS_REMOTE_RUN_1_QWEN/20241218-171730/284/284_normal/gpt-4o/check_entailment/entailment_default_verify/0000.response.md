Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. However, based on the provided output hints and the analysis of the code, there are potential issues with the `func_1` function that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the function may miss certain composite numbers that should be identified as non-prime. For instance, the function does not correctly identify numbers like 25 or 35 as non-prime because they are not divisible by 2 or 3 and do not fall into the form \(i\) or \(i+2\) where \(i \equiv 5 \mod 6\).

Given the problem description, the program needs to find an \(m\) such that \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not a prime number. The function `func_1` should accurately determine if a number is prime. However, the current implementation of `func_1` may fail to correctly identify certain composite numbers, leading to potential incorrect outputs. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct needs to be revised.
