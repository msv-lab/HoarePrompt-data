You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000, and x > 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000, and x > 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and for all integers i where \( i \equiv 5 \mod 6 \) and \( i^2 \leq x \), \( x \% i \neq 0 \) and \( x \% (i + 2) \neq 0 \); i is incremented to a value greater than or equal to the square root of x, and the function does not return anything (implying x remains unchanged).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. It returns `True` if `x` passes all the conditions within the function, and `False` otherwise. Specifically:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `x` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, it returns `True`.
- If `x` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For other values of `x` greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks if `x` is not divisible by any integer of the form \( i \) or \( i + 2 \) where \( i \equiv 5 \mod 6 \) and \( i^2 \leq x \). If `x` passes this check, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the cases where `x` is 1, 2, or 3.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number greater than 3.
- The function may have missed handling cases where `x` is a composite number that is not divisible by 2 or 3 but still fails the primality test (e.g., numbers like 25, 35, etc.).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
