The code `print(min_x)` simply prints the value of `min_x`. Since `min_x` was already calculated in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. No new assignment or calculation happens, only the printing of `min_x`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\); `M` is an integer such that \(1 \le M \le 10^{18}\); `K` is an integer such that \(1 \le K \le N\); `L` is an integer such that \(1 \le L \le 10^{18}\); `min_x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor\); and the condition \(M \cdot \text{min\_x} \le N - K\) holds; `min_x` is printed.**
