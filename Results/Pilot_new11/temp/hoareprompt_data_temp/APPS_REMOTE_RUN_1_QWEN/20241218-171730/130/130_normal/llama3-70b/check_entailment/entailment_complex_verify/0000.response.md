Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

- The program checks if the total number of friends (`M`) is sufficient to provide at least `N - K + 1` different coins (since Ivan already has `K` coins out of `N` possible ones).
- It also ensures that the total number of friends (`M`) is enough to provide at least `L` new coins.
- If both conditions are met, it prints `1` indicating that each friend can gift one coin.
- Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the constraints and the conditions specified in the problem, the program correctly handles all potential cases and provides the right output. Therefore, the program is correct. The annotations align with the original assessment, confirming that the program behaves as expected.
