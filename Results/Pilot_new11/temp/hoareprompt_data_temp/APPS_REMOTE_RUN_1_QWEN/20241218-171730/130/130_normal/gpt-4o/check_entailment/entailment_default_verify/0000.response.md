Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that at least `L` coins are new in Ivan's collection, given the constraints. The output hints confirm that the program handles all necessary cases, including the calculation of `min_x` and the feasibility check. There is no evidence in the provided information that suggests the program does not meet the problem description or the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
