The code `N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, these variables now hold specific integer values. However, the exact values are not specified in the initial state, so we can only say that they are integers satisfying the given conditions.

Output State: **$N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers; $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$; and $M \cdot N \ge K + L$.**
