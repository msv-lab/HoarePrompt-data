Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \), which does not solve the problem correctly. The problem requires transforming an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \) in the minimum number of seconds by modifying one side per second while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate. The given code simply outputs the difference between \( x \) and \( y \), which does not account for the transformation process and the constraint that each side must remain part of a valid triangle throughout the transformations. For example, the provided test cases show that the transformation involves multiple steps to maintain the triangle properties, not just a direct subtraction.
