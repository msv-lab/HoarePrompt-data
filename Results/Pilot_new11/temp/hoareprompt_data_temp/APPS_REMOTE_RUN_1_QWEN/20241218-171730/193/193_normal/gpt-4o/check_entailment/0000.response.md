Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` does not account for the fact that the side lengths must remain a valid triangle at each step. 

For example, consider the input `(10, 5)`. According to the problem, we need to transform a triangle of side length 10 into one of side length 5. The correct steps would be:
- Change one side from 10 to 8 (1 second).
- Change another side from 10 to 6 (2 seconds).
- Change the last side from 10 to 5 (3 seconds).

So, the correct output should be `3` seconds. However, the program incorrectly outputs `5` seconds using the formula `(10 - 5) // 2 + (10 - 5) % 2`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases.
