The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Since the input values are integers and they replace the existing values of `x` and `y`, the new values of `x` and `y` will be the integers entered by the user. The condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000` remains valid, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are now the input values.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from 3 to 100,000 inclusive, `y` is an integer from 3 to 100,000 inclusive, 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
