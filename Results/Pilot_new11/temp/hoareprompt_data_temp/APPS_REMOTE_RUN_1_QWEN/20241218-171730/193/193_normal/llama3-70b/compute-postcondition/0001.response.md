The code `print(abs(x - y))` calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. Since `x` and `y` are integers within the range of 3 to 100,000 and 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, the value of `abs(x - y)` will be `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` themselves do not change, but their difference is printed. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from 3 to 100,000 inclusive, `y` is an integer from 3 to 100,000 inclusive, 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed.**
