The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`
- `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 1

After executing the line `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))`, the new value of `max_len` will be the maximum of the previous value of `max_len` and the length of `substr`.

Since the exact value of `max_len` was previously defined as "the maximum of its current value and 1", and `len(substr)` is the length of the substring, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(substr)`**
