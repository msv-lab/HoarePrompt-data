Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**: The loop variable is `j`, and the loop runs from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, there must be values of `j` that satisfy the condition `i + 1 <= j <= n + 1`.

3. **Initial Values and Constraints**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_len` is 0 (this variable is not directly related to the loop execution).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`, we need to ensure that there is at least one value of `j` that satisfies the condition. This means `i + 1` should be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Given that `n > 0`, we need to ensure `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Summary of Required Adjustments**:
   - Ensure `i` is a valid starting point such that `i + 1 <= n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is already specified as greater than 0, the main concern is ensuring `i` is within a valid range.

Based on these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be an integer such that `i < n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (already given).
- `s` is a non-empty string (already given).

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**`i` must be an integer such that `i < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
