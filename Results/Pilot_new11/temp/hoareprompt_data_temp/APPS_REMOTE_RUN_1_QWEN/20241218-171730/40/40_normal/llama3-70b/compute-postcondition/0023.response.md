Postcondition: ***`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse).***
