The code snippet updates the `max_len` variable to be the maximum value between its current value and the length of the `substr` substring. The `substr` substring remains unchanged.

Let's denote the length of `substr` as `len_substr`, which is `j - i - 1` (since substr starts at index `i` and ends at `j-1`). The `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `len_substr`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the `max_len` will be the maximum of its original value and the length of `substr`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n` and now `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of `substr`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).**
