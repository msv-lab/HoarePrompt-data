Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` remains unchanged.***
