The code snippet updates the `max_len` variable to be the maximum value between the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`. However, the exact value of `max_len` before this operation is not specified, only that `i < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n > 0`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to an undefined index `j`. The reverse condition of `substr` is also not relevant here.

Let's denote the length of `substr` as `len_substr`. The code will set `max_len` to the maximum of its current value and `len_substr`.

Therefore, after executing the code:

- The value of `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `len_substr`.
- The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, and `substr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, and `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to an undefined index `j`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.**
