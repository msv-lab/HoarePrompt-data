Postcondition: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).**
