Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer equal to `n-1`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`, and `volumes` remains unchanged.**
