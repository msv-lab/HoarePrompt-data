Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi r^2 h \), sorts the cakes in descending order based on their volume, and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of cakes such that no cake in the subset has both dimensions (radius and height) less than those of any other cake in the subset. The function prints the maximum volume that can be achieved.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list is empty, the function will print 0.0 as the maximum volume.
- If there is only one cake, the function will print the volume of that single cake.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not handle cases where multiple cakes have the same dimensions (both radius and height). In such cases, the current logic might not correctly determine the maximum volume achievable. The current logic assumes that if one cake has both dimensions smaller than another, it cannot be part of the optimal subset, which might not always be true if the volumes are significantly different.
