Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `volumes[i-2]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` (where `j` is such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i-2]`), `volumes` remains unchanged, and `i` is still greater than or equal to 1. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
