The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes` from standard input, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. The function assumes that the input format is correct and that the list `cakes` has the correct structure (i.e., each element is a tuple containing exactly two integers). If the input does not conform to this structure, the behavior is undefined.
