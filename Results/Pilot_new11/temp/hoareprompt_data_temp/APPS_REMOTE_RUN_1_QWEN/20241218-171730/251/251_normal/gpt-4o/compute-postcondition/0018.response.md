Postcondition: **`i` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is the maximum possible value of the subproblem solution considering the volumes of the cakes up to index `i-1`, `dp[0]` is now `volumes[0]`, `volumes` remains unchanged, and the current value of `j` satisfies `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`**
