The code `print(dp[-1])` simply prints the last element of the `dp` array, which is the value of `dp[n-1]`. This does not change any of the values in the `dp` array or any other variables. It only outputs the value of `dp[n-1]`.

Output State: **`dp` is an array of length `n` where `dp[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-1`) contains the maximum volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of cakes such that no cake in the subset has both dimensions less than those of any other cake in the subset, up to the `i-th` cake, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `cakes` is a list of cakes with each element containing three values representing the dimensions and volume of a cake; the value of `dp[n-1]` is printed.**
