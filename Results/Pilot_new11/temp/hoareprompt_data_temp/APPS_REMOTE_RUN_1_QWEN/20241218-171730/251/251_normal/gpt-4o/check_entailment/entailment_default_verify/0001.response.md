Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum volume of the special cake, which aligns with the problem description. The function `func_2` reads the input according to the specified format and calls `func_1` to compute the result. The output hints confirm that the program expects the input to be in the correct format, and given the constraints and examples provided, the program should handle all cases correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
