Output State: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is the last index in the loop, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`, the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` must hold true for `j` in the range of 0 to `i-1`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all valid `j`.**
