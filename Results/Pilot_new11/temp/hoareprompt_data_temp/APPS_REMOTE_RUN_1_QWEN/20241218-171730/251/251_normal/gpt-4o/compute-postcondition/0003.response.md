The code assigns the result of `func_1(n, cakes)` to the variable `result`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so its exact behavior is unknown. Given the information, the only changes are the introduction of the `result` variable, which holds the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`. The initial values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the radius and height of the corresponding cake, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`**
