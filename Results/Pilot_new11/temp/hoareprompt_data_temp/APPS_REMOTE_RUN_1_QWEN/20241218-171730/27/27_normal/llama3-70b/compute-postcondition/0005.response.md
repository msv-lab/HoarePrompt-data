`a5` is assigned the value of `y ** (x ** z)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unchanged, and the values of `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` remain as they were initially set to `x`. The state of `a4` is also unchanged since no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]; `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]; `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]; `a1` is `x`; `a2` is `x`; `a3` is `x`; `a4` is `x`; `a5` is `y ** (x ** z)`**
