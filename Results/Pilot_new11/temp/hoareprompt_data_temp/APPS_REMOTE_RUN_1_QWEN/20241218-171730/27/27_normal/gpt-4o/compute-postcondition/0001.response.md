The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` reads three space-separated floats from standard input and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive, and `input` is now defined as `sys.stdin.read`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated to the values read from the input. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the values read from `sys.stdin.read()`, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive; `input` is now defined as `sys.stdin.read`.**
