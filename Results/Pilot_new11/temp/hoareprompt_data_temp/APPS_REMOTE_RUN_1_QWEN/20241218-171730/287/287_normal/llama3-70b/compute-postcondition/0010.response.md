The code `res += 2` increments the value of `res` by 2. Given the initial state where `res` is 2 unless `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n`, in which case `res` is 1, the value of `res` changes only if the condition was true. If the condition was true, `res` would be 1, and after executing `res += 2`, `res` would become 3. If the condition was false, `res` would be 2, and after executing `res += 2`, `res` would become 4. 

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified and we don't know whether the condition `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n` was met, we need to consider both cases.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `i` is i_prev + 1, and `res` is 3 if `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n` and 4 otherwise**
