The code subtracts 1 from `res`. Based on the initial conditions, `res` is determined by the following logic:

- If `n % i == 0` and `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n`, then `res` is 3.
- Otherwise, `res` is 4.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `res` is 3, then after subtracting 1, `res` becomes 2.
2. If `res` is 4, then after subtracting 1, `res` becomes 3.

In both scenarios, `res` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `i` is i_prev + 1, `res` is 2 if res was initially 3 or `res` is 3 if res was initially 4.**
