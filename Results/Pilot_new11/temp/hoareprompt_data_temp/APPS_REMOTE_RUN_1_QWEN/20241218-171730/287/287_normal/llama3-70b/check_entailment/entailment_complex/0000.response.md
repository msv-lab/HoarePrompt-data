Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the task is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the program implemented in the annotated code actually calculates the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not related to the weights of splits of \( n \).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all possible splits of \( n \) and then determine the distinct weights of these splits. The current implementation only counts divisors, which does not meet the requirement of finding the number of different weights of splits.

Here is a brief outline of how the correct solution would work:
1. Generate all possible splits of \( n \).
2. Determine the weight of each split.
3. Count the number of unique weights among these splits.

The provided solution does not implement these steps and instead focuses on counting divisors, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
