`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The user will input an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, and this value replaces the current value of `n`. The previous value of `n` is no longer relevant since it has been replaced.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9**
