Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Loop Condition
The `while` loop condition is:
\[ i * i \leq num \]

### Step 2: Current States
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)
- `count` is 0 (this state does not affect the loop directly)
- `i` is 1

### Step 3: Determine the Initial Condition
When `i` is 1, the condition becomes:
\[ 1 * 1 \leq num \]
\[ 1 \leq num \]

Since \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) is always true, the loop should start executing immediately based on the current values.

### Step 4: Ensure the Loop Executes One More Time
To ensure the loop executes at least one more time, we need to increment `i` such that the condition still holds true. The next value of `i` would be 2. We need to check if \(2 * 2 \leq num\) holds true.

### Step 5: Verify the New Condition
If `num` is at least 4 (since \(2 * 2 = 4\)), then the loop will continue to execute. Since `num` can be any integer from 1 to \(10^9\), the minimum value for `num` that ensures the loop continues is 4.

### Step 6: Adjust the State
We need to adjust the state to ensure that `i` is 2, and `num` is at least 4.

### Final Answer
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4; `count` is 0; `i` is 2**
