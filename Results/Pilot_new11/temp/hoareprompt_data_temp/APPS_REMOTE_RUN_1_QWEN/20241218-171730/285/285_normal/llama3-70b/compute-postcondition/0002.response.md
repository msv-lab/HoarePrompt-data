Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

Given:
- Initially, `n` is given as an integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- The loop is defined as:
  ```python
  for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

To ensure the loop executes, the expression inside the `range()` function must evaluate to a positive integer. Specifically, \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1\) must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - \((n - a * 1234567)\): This term calculates the remaining value after subtracting \(a \times 1234567\) from \(n\).
   - \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456\): This term performs integer division of the result by 123456.
   - \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1\): Adding 1 ensures that the range function includes the starting point.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0\).
   - Simplifying this, we need \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 \geq 0\), which means \(n - a * 1234567 \geq 0\).

3. **Initial State**:
   - Initially, `n` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - Since \(a\) is not specified initially, we assume it is a known constant or variable within the program context.

### Conclusion:

The loop will start executing if \(n \geq a \times 1234567\). Given that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), we need to ensure \(n\) is sufficiently large relative to \(a \times 1234567\).

### Final Answer:

State:
```plaintext
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`**
```

This ensures that the loop will start executing based on the given condition.
