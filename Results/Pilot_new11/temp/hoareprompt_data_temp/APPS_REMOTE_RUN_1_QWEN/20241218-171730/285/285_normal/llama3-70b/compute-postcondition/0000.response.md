The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided, while the precondition that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) still holds.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)**
