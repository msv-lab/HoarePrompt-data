The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It only prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`, `b` is `b_current`, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, print('YES') has been executed**
