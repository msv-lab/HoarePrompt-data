Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1,234,567, `a` is `a_{\text{initial}} + 1`, `b` is `b_{\text{final}} + 2`, and `c` is equal to \((n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 1) \times 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + 2) \times 123456) // 1234; if the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` holds true, the printed string is 'YES'. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables and the printed string remains undefined.***
