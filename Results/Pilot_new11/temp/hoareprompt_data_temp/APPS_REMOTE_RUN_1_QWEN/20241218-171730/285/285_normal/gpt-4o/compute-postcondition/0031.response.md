The code updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` by subtracting `b * car_cost` from the current value of `remaining_after_houses`. The original value of `remaining_after_cars` is given as `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`. After executing the code, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

So, the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` is now `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The precondition that `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0 remains valid.

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`**
