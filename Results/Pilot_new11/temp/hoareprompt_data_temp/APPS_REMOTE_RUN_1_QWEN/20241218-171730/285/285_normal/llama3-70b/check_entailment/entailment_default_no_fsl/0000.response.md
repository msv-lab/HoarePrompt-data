Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `1234567`. In such cases, the loops will not execute because `n // 1234567` will be `0`, and the outer loop will terminate immediately. As a result, the function will print 'NO' without attempting to find valid values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. For example, if `n = 1234`, the function will incorrectly print 'NO', even though it is possible to spend all game-coins by purchasing one computer.
