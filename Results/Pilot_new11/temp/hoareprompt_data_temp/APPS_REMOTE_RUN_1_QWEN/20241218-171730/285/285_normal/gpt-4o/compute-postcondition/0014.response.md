Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states**: The initial states at the end of the previous iteration are as follows:
   - `total` remains unchanged
   - `house_cost` remains unchanged
   - `car_cost` remains unchanged
   - `computer_cost` remains unchanged
   - `a` remains unchanged
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged
   - `remaining_after_cars` remains unchanged

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `b` such that `b` ranges from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. The loop will continue as long as `b` is within this range.

3. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `b` starts from `0` and increments by `1` with each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `b` and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, we need to increment `b` by `1` for the next iteration.
   - We do not change `remaining_after_houses` or `car_cost` because the loop itself does not alter these values directly.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The state should reflect that `b` is incremented by `1` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `b` changes from its current value to `b + 1`.

The updated state will be:

State: **`total` remains unchanged, `house_cost` remains unchanged, `car_cost` remains unchanged, `computer_cost` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` remains unchanged, `b` is `b + 1`**.

However, since the exact value of `b` is not specified, we will represent it in a general form.

Final Answer:
State: **`total` remains unchanged, `house_cost` remains unchanged, `car_cost` remains unchanged, `computer_cost` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1**.
