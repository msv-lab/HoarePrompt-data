`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is incremented by 1, its new value is `b + 1`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged, and `car_cost` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.

Output State: **`total` remains unchanged, `house_cost` remains unchanged, `car_cost` remains unchanged, `computer_cost` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`, `b` is incremented by 1**
