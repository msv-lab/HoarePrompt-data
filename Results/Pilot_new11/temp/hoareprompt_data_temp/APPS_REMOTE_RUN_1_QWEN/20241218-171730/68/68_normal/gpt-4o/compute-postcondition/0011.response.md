The code `print('?')` does not change any variable values or perform any operations that affect the variables. It simply prints a question mark to the console. The output of the print statement is not included in the final state of the variables.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the maximum upvotes are not less than the minimum downvotes.**
