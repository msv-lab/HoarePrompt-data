The code assigns the value of `y + z` to `max_downvotes`. Since `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100 and `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, the value of `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. The states of the other variables (`min_upvotes`, `y`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
