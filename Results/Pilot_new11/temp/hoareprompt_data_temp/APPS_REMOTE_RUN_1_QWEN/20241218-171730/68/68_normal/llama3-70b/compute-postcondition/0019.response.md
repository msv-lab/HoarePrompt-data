Functionality: **The function takes three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, each ranging from 0 to 100. It then evaluates these inputs according to specific conditions and prints one of four possible outputs: '+', '-', '0', or '?'. The function does not return a value but modifies the console output based on the conditions met. If \(x\) is greater than \(y + z\), it prints '+'. If \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints '-'. If \(x\) equals \(y\) and \(z\) is 0, it prints '0'. In all other cases, it prints '?'. The values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) remain unchanged after the function executes.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are all 0, the function will print '?' since none of the specific conditions are met.
- If \(x\) is exactly equal to \(y + z\), the function will print '?' because the condition \(x > y + z\) is not met.
- If \(x\) equals \(y\) but \(z\) is not 0, the function will print '?' instead of '0'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not perform any return operation; it only modifies the console output. Therefore, there is no return value.
