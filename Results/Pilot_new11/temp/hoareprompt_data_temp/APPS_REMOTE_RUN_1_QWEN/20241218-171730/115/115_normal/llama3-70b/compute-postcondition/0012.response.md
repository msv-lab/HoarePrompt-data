The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the provided code snippet does not show a loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, j + 1)` where `j` is a valid index satisfying the given conditions, and there exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`, and `j` is 1 (since it was previously `j`).**
