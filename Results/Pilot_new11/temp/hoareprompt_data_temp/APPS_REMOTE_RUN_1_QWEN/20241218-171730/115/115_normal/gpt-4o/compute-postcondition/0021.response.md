The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `i` and `j` are known relative to `n` and `m`.

- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped.

Since the code appends a new tuple to the list `operations`, the updated state of `operations` will include the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `m` is at least 2; `operations` is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `B` that was flipped, now including the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`; the value of `B[i][j]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
