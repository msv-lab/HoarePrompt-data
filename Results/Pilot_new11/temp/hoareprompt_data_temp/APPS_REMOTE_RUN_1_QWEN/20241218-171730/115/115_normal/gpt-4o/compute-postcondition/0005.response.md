The code assigns the value 1 to `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged because these variables are not affected by the assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, the value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, the value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j]` is 1, the value of `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
