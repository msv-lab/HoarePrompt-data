The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` is 0, and the values of `j` satisfy the condition \(2 \le j < m - 1\). Therefore, `i + 1` will be 1, and `j + 1` will be `j + 1`.

The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)` and now also contains the tuple `(1, j + 1)`, and there exists at least one valid index `j` such that `2 \le j < m - 1` and `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`.
