Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.
- For each `j`, the loop checks if any of the four conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true.
- If any of these conditions are true, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to `ops`.
- The loop continues this process for all `j` in the specified range.
- After the loop completes, `ops` will contain all the tuples that satisfy the given conditions for the entire matrix `A`.

Since the loop does not modify `i`, `n`, `m`, or `A`, their values remain unchanged. The only change occurs in `ops`, which collects all the valid tuples based on the conditions provided.
