Let's break down the requirements and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`
- `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- For every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`

### Loop:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts from `j = 0` and goes up to `j < m`.
   - Since `m` is at least 2, the loop can definitely start with `j = 0`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `total`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, and `B` do not directly affect the condition for the loop to start executing. These variables remain unchanged within the loop body unless explicitly modified inside the loop.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < m`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `m` is at least 2, the loop can start executing with `j = 0`. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `j` starts from 0 when the loop begins.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `j` must be 0**
