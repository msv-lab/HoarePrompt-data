Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program always assumes that a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix can be set to \(1\) if any of its elements are \(1\), but it fails to ensure that all \(1\)s in matrix \( A \) are covered by such operations. 

Consider the following input:

```
Input
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

In this case, the program will output `1` and the operation `(1, 1)` because it checks if any of the elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are `1`, and since \(A[1][1] = 0\), it continues without performing the operation. However, setting \(B[1, 1]\), \(B[1, 2]\), \(B[2, 1]\), and \(B[2, 2]\) to `1` does not result in the desired transformation of matrix \( B \) to match matrix \( A \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all necessary \(2 \times 2\) submatrices are checked and set to `1` based on the elements in matrix \( A \).
