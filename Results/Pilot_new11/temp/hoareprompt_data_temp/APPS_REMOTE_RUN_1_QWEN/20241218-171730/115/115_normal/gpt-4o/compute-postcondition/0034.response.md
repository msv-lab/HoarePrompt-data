Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples representing the 2x2 submatrices in `B` that were flipped. The condition `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.***
