To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\).
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `m - 1` must be at least 1, which means `m` must be at least 2. However, since `m` is already constrained to be in the range \(2 \le m \le 50\) (from the given information), this condition is satisfied by the constraints themselves.

2. **Variables in the Loop**:
   - The loop variable `j` will take values from 0 to `m - 2`.

Given that the constraints on `m` are already provided and the loop can iterate as long as `m` is at least 2, we don't need to adjust `m` further because the range `range(m - 1)` will always include at least one value (0) if `m` is at least 2.

The initial states provided do not need adjustment based on the loop logic. The states before the loop starting are already sufficient to ensure the loop can execute.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the initial states for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\).
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is an empty list.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list**.
