The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables outside of a loop. Given the initial state, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement because it does not execute any code that changes their values.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that certain conditions involving `A` are met, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` initially, and the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1**
