The code `print(len(operations))` prints the length of the `operations` list. This operation does not change the values of any variables but only prints the length of the `operations` list. The `operations` list represents the positions of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`. The length of `operations` is the number of such submatrices.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the value printed is the length of the `operations` list.**
