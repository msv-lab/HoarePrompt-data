The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Since no variables are assigned new values, the only change is the addition of this tuple to the list `ops`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 1)]`, `i` is its original value, `j` is its original value**
