Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]` is set to 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is set to 1, `operations` contains the tuple (1, 1). Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
