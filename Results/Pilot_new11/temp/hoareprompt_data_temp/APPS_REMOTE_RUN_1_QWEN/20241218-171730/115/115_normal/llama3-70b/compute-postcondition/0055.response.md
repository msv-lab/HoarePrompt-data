The `continue` statement in the given code does not change any variable values or perform any operations that would affect the variables. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement has no direct impact on the variables outside of possibly being part of a loop that was not shown.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(m > 5\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, 4)\), `j` is 4**
