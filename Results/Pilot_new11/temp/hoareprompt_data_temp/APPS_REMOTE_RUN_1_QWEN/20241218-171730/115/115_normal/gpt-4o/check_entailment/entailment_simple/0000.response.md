Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, and processes it to create the matrix \( A \).
   - It correctly handles the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) and initializes matrix \( B \) with zeros.

2. **Filling Matrix \( B \)**:
   - The program iterates through \( A \) and identifies submatrices of size \( 2 \times 2 \) that need to be flipped.
   - When it finds a submatrix where all four elements are \( 1 \), it sets the corresponding positions in \( B \) to \( 1 \).
   - The operations are stored in the `operations` list, which records the coordinates of the top-left corner of each flipped \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix.

3. **Validation**:
   - After marking the necessary positions, the program checks if the resulting matrix \( B \) matches \( A \).
   - If there is any discrepancy, it returns \(-1\).
   - If \( B \) matches \( A \), it prints the number of operations performed and then prints each operation in the required format.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct according to the problem description, including printing \(-1\) if the transformation is impossible and providing the sequence of operations otherwise.

Given that the program follows the steps precisely as outlined in the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct and meets all the specified requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
