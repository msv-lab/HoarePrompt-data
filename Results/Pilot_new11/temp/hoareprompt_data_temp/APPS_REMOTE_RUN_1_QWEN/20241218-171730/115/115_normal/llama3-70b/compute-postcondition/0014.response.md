The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, the tuple appended to `ops` will be `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, and there exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**
