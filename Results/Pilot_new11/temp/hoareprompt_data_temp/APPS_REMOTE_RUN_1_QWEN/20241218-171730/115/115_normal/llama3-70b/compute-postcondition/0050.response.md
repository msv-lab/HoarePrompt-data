The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables; it merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Since no variables are modified and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop continues to its next iteration, the output state will remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, j + 1)\) if any of these conditions hold, `j` is 3**
