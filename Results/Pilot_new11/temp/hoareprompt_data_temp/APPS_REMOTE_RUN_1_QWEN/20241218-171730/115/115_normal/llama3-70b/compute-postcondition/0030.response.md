Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is 1.
   - \( n \) is a non-negative integer with at least 3.
   - \( m \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le m \le 50 \).
   - \( A \) is a matrix of size \( n \times m \) where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - \( ops \) is a list containing the additional tuple \((2, j + 1)\) if the condition \( A[i][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i][j + 1] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 \) is satisfied, \( j \) is in the range \([0, m - 2]\) and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - \( j \) is in the range \([0, m - 2]\).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over \( j \) from 0 to \( m - 2 \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) was within the range \([0, m - 2]\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) must increment by 1 and still be within the range \([0, m - 2]\).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop increments \( j \) by 1, \( j \) will become \( j + 1 \).
   - \( j \) must now be in the range \([1, m - 1]\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- \( i \) remains 1.
- \( n \) remains a non-negative integer with at least 3.
- \( m \) remains an integer such that \( 2 \le m \le 50 \).
- \( A \) remains a matrix of size \( n \times m \) where each element is either 0 or 1.
- \( ops \) remains a list containing the additional tuple \((2, j + 1)\) if the condition \( A[i][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i][j + 1] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 \) is satisfied, \( j \) is in the range \([0, m - 2]\) and remains unchanged otherwise.
- \( j \) becomes \( j + 1 \), which must be in the range \([1, m - 1]\).

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the additional tuple `(2, j + 1)` if the condition `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is satisfied, `j` is in the range \([1, m - 1]\)**.
