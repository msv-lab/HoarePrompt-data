Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues execution without returning anything.***
