The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple to the list `ops`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3 (`n >= 3`)
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied
- `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise

The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. Since the value of `j` is not specified but remains unchanged, let's denote it as `j`.

Thus, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` becomes `(3, j + 1)`. This tuple is appended to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied plus the new tuple `(3, j + 1)`, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise**.
