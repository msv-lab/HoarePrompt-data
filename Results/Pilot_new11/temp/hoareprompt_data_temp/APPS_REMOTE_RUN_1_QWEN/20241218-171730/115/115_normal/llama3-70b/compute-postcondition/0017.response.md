The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, the code does not specify which loop this statement belongs to, and no loop structure was provided. Since there's no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and does not change the state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, and there exists at least one valid index `j` such that `j < m - 1` and `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`**
