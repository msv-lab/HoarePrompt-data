Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(m > 5\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, and the new tuple \((3, 4)\). If \(A[2][4] == 1\) and \(A[3][4] == 1\) and \(A[2][5] == 1\) and \(A[3][5] == 1\), then \((3, 4)\) is already in `ops`. Otherwise, \((3, 4)\) is added to `ops`.***
