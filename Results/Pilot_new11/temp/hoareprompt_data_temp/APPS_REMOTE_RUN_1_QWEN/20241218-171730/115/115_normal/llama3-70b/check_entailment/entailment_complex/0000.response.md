Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks whether the submatrix of size \(2 \times 2\) has any '1's and skips the operation if all four elements are '1'. However, the problem statement requires setting all four elements to '1' if any of them are '1'. The current implementation only continues the loop if all four elements are '1', which means it would skip setting the submatrix to '1' if any single element is '0'.

2. **Missing Operations for Single '1'**: The program does not include operations to set individual '1's to '1' in the matrix. According to the problem statement, the goal is to make matrix \(B\) equal to matrix \(A\), and this requires setting specific \(2 \times 2\) submatrices to '1'. If there is a '1' in matrix \(A\) that is not part of a larger \(2 \times 2\) submatrix, the program does not account for this.

To correct this, the program should iterate through each cell of the matrix and check if the cell or any of its adjacent cells in the next row or column is '1'. If so, add the coordinates of the top-left cell of the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix to the list of operations. Hereâ€™s how the corrected logic should look:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] == 1:
                # Add the top-left corner of the 2x2 submatrix
                ops.append((i, j))

    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0] + 1, op[1] + 1)
```

This corrected version ensures that every '1' in the matrix is part of a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix, and it includes all necessary operations to transform \(B\) into \(A\).
