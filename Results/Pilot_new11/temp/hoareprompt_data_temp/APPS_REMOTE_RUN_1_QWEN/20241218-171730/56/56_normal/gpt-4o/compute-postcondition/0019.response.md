The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes and assigns the last element of the `bits` list to the variable `smallest`. Since `bits` contains the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n`, after popping the last element, `smallest` will hold the position of the least significant 1-bit in `n`, and `bits` will contain the remaining positions.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` without the last position, and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > len(bits)\); `smallest` is the position of the least significant 1-bit in `n`.**
