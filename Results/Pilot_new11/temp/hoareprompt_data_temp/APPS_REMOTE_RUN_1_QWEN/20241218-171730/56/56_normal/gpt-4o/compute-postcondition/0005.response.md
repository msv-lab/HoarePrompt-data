Postcondition: ***`total` is not relevant here, `i` will start from 60 and decrement, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is an empty list. The value of `n` has a bit set at position `i` after performing the operation `(n >> i & 1)` which evaluates to 1***
