Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where \( n \) is a power of 2 and \( k = 1 \). In such cases, the function returns 'No', but according to the problem description, the function should return 'Yes' without modifying the list of bit positions.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
2 1

Output
No
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
Output
Yes
0
```

This is because \( 2^1 = 2 \) and the largest integer in the sequence is minimized when the sequence contains a single element, which is 0 in this case.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
