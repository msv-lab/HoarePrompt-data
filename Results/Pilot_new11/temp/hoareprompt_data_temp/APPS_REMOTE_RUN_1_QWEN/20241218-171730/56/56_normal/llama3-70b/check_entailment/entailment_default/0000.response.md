Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the largest integer in the sequence is minimized and that the sequence is lexicographically largest among those with the minimum largest integer. 

Consider the input:
```
13 2
```

The code would attempt to find two integers such that \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} = 13\). The correct solution is \((-2, -2)\) because \(2^{-2} + 2^{-2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \neq 13\), but this is not a valid sequence since it does not sum to 13. Instead, the code would incorrectly return "No".

Additionally, for other inputs, the code may not produce the lexicographically largest sequence. For instance, for the input:
```
13 3
```

The correct solution should be \((-1, -1, 3)\) because it is the lexicographically largest sequence with the smallest maximum value among all valid sequences. However, the provided code would not generate this sequence correctly.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the output is incorrect in some scenarios.
