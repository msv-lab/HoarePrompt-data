The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers. Specifically, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`.

- Case_1: The function returns 'No'.
- Case_2: The function returns 'No'.
- Case_3: The function returns 'Yes' followed by the bits list converted to a space-separated string of integers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and return either 'No', 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of integers, or 'No' again, based on certain conditions related to `n` and `k`.
