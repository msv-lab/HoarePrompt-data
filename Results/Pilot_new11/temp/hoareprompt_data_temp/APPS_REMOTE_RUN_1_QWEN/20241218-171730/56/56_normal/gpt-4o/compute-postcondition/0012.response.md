`bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 57) to the list `bits`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `bits` are preserved, and now `bits` contains the values 60, 58, and 57.

Output State: **`i` is 57, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and the 58th bit and 59th bit of `n` must both be 1, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the values 60, 58, and 57**
