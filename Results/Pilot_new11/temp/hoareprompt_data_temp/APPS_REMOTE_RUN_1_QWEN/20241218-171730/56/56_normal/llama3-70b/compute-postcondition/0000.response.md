`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the `input().split()` function, which converts the input into integers. The original values of `n` and `k` are replaced by the integers entered by the user. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input(), `k` is an integer obtained from input(), and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5.**
