`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The original value of `visited_count` is 1, so the new value is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1 or 2 depending on the first element of `path`**
