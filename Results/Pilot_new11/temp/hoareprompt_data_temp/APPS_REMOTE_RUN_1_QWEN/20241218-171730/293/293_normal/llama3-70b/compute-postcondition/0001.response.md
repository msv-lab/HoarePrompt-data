The code `ans = 0` assigns the integer value `0` to the variable `ans`. The values of the variables `h` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\); `ans` is `0`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\); `ans` is `0`**
