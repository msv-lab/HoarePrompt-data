Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the given algorithm. According to the problem description, Amr follows an infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." to navigate through the tree. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of nodes visited by simply dividing the current node index `n` by 2 and summing up the results based on whether `n` is even or odd.

For example, consider the input `3 6`. According to the problem description, Amr's path would be as follows:

1. Start at the root (node 1).
2. Move right (R) to node 2.
3. Move right (R) to node 5.
4. Move left (L) to node 3.
5. Move left (L) to node 7 (exit).

The correct sequence of nodes visited (excluding the exit node) is: 2, 5, 3. Therefore, the number of nodes visited is 3.

However, the program calculates the result as follows:
- `n = 6` (even), so `ans += 6 // 2 - 1 = 2`.
- `n = 3` (odd), so `ans += 3 // 2 = 1`.

Thus, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the given algorithm and is incorrect.
