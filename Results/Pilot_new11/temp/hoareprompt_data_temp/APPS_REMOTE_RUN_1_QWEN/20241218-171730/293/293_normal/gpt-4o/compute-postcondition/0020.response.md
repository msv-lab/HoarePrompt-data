`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 2, so the new value is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 3 or 4.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 3 or 4**
