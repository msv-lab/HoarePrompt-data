The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\) and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\), the values of `h` and `n` are now determined by the input. However, without specific input values, we can only say that `h` and `n` are within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\)**
