The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into an integer, assigning this value to `x`. Since the input can be any integer within the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), the specific value of `x` will depend on the user's input. However, the output state will reflect that `x` now holds the value of the input, and the precondition that `x` is an integer within the specified range remains valid.

Output State: **`x` is the input integer within the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\)**
