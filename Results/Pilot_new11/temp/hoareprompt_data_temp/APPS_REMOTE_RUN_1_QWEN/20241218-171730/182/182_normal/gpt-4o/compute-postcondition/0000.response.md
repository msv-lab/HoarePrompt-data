`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The input can be any integer within the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation, and `x` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.**
