Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`

- The value of `normalized_angle` is initially `x % 360`, which means it is the remainder when `x` is divided by 360. Since `x` is an integer within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\), `normalized_angle` will be in the range [0, 359].
  
- `(360 - normalized_angle)` calculates the difference between 360 and `normalized_angle`. This value will be in the range [0, 360).

- `// 90` performs integer division by 90, which results in the number of full 90-degree turns from 360 minus `normalized_angle`.

- `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range [0, 3). The value of `turns` can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `normalized_angle`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, let's consider the different cases based on the value of `normalized_angle`:

- If `normalized_angle` is 0, then `360 - normalized_angle` is 360, and `(360 // 90) % 4` is 0.
- If `normalized_angle` is 90, then `360 - normalized_angle` is 270, and `(270 // 90) % 4` is 3.
- If `normalized_angle` is 180, then `360 - normalized_angle` is 180, and `(180 // 90) % 4` is 2.
- If `normalized_angle` is 270, then `360 - normalized_angle` is 90, and `(90 // 90) % 4` is 1.

In general, the value of `turns` will be determined by the position of `normalized_angle` relative to the boundaries of the 90-degree segments.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\); `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`; `turns` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `normalized_angle`**.
