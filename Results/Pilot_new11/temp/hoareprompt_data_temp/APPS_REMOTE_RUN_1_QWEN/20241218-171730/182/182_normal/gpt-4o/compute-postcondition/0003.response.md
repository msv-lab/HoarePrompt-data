The code `print(turns)` simply prints the value of the `turns` variable. It does not change the value of any variables. The other variables (`x` and `normalized_angle`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\); `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`; `turns` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `normalized_angle`**
