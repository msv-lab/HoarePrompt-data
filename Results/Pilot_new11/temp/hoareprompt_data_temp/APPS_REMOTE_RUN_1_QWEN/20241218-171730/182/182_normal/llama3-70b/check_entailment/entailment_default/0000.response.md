Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation of the image from the vertical direction. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints:

1. The input \( x \) is read and converted to an integer.
2. The value of \( x \) is adjusted to be within the range \([0, 359]\) using modulo 360.
3. Based on the value of \( x \), the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed:
   - If \( x \) is 0, no turns are needed.
   - For other values, the formula \(((x + 90 - 1) // 90) \% 4\) correctly computes the number of turns required to align the image with the minimum deviation from the vertical direction.

The provided output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected for various values of \( x \). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
