Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction. Here's how it works:

1. The input angle `x` is first reduced to an equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 360 degrees using modulo 360 operation.
2. The program then determines the minimum deviation by calculating `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which effectively finds the closest multiple of 90 degrees to the input angle and counts the number of 90-degree turns needed to reach that multiple.

This approach ensures that the program accounts for all possible angles and provides the correct number of 90-degree turns for minimizing the deviation. Since the logic handles both positive and negative angles correctly and considers the wrap-around nature of the angle space, the program is correct according to the problem description.
