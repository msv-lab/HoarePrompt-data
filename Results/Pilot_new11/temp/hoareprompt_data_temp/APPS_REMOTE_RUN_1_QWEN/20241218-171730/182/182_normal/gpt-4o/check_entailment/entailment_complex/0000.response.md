Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` representing the camera angle in degrees. This matches the input specification where `x` can be any integer in the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\).

2. **Normalization**: The program uses the modulo operation (`% 360`) to normalize the angle to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. This step ensures that the angle is within a standard range for comparison purposes.

3. **Calculating Turns**: The program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align the image as closely as possible to a vertical orientation. It does this by computing `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. 
   - The expression `360 - normalized_angle` determines the shortest angular distance to the closest multiple of 90 degrees.
   - Dividing by 90 gives the number of 90-degree turns needed.
   - Taking the result modulo 4 ensures the result is within the range of 0 to 3, corresponding to 0, 1, 2, or 3 turns.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of turns, which is the output specified by the problem statement.

Given these steps, the program accurately determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical for any given input angle, adhering to the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
