The code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` respectively. Since the input is not specified, we can denote the input integers as `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` for clarity. The initial constraints are:

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`
- `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will be the integers read from the input, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is `a`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, `r` is `d`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ a, 1 ≤ c ≤ a, c ≤ d ≤ a**
