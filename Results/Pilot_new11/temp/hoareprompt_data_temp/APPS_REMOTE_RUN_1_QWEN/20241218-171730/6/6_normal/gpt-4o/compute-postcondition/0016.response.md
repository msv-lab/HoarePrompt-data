Postcondition: **`n` is `a`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `1` if the condition `l == 1` is true, otherwise `l` is `c`; `r` is `d`. The output of the program is `0` if `l == 1 and r == n`. Otherwise, the output is `abs(b - d) + 1` if `l == 1`. If `r` equals `n`, the output is `abs(b - c) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is `min(abs(b - c) + (d - c + 2), abs(b - d) + (d - c + 2))`.**
