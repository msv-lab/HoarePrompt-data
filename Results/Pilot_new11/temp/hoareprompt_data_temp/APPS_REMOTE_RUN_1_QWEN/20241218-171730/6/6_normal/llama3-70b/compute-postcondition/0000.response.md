The code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Since the input is split into integers, these variables now hold specific integer values that were input by the user, replacing their previous undefined states.

Given the precondition:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`
- `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will be the specific integers provided by the user, adhering to the given constraints.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are specific integers within their respective ranges.**
