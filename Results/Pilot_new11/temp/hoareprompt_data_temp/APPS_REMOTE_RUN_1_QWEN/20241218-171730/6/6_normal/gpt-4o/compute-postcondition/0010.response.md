The code `move_to_l = abs(pos - l)` assigns the absolute difference between the current position `pos` and the left boundary `l` to the variable `move_to_l`. Given the initial state where `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ a, 1 ≤ c ≤ a, c ≤ d ≤ a, l ≠ 1 or r ≠ n, l ≠ 1`, the value of `move_to_l` will be calculated as `abs(b - c)`. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `d`, `pos` is `b`, `l` is `c`, `r` is `n`, `move_to_l` is `abs(b - c)`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ a, 1 ≤ c ≤ a, c ≤ d ≤ a, l ≠ 1 or r ≠ n, l ≠ 1`**
