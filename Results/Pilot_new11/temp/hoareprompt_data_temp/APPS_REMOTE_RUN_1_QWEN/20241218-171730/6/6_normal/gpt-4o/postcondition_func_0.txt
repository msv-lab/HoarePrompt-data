The function accepts four parameters \( n \), \( pos \), \( l \), and \( r \), where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), \( 1 \leq pos \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n \). It calculates and returns the minimum number of moves required for a position \( pos \) to reach either end \( l \) or \( r \) of a sequence of length \( n \). If \( l \) is equal to \( r \), the function returns 0. If \( l \) is 1 and \( r \) is \( n \), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of two possible scenarios: moving to \( l \) and then to \( r \), or moving to \( r \) and then to \( l \), considering the additional moves needed to cover the distance between \( l \) and \( r \).
