The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, it seems these parameters (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`) are intended to be used within the function. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, but we can infer its expected behavior from the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, and does not return any value.**
