The code initializes an empty list named `regular_sales`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, or the `days` list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `f` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` such that 0 ≤ `k_i`, `l_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients that will come to the shop on the `i`-th day, respectively; `regular_sales` is an empty list.**
