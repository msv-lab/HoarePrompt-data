The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `f`, and does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `n` and `f` are updated based on the input, but their specific values are not known without additional input.

Output State: **`n` and `f` are integers with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; for each i in range(`n`), `k_i` and `l_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `k_i`, `l_i` ≤ 10^9.**
