Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with `n` elements, each being the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with `n` elements, each being \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\) from the corresponding tuple in `days`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `f`:** Since `f` starts as a non-negative integer and decreases by 1 for each iteration, after the loop finishes, `f` will be \(f - n\).
- **`days`:** The `days` list remains unchanged during the loop as the loop only iterates over its elements without modifying them.
- **`regular_sales`:** For each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `regular_sales` appends the minimum value of `k_i` and `l_i`. After the loop completes, `regular_sales` will have `n` elements, each representing the minimum value of the corresponding tuple.
- **`potential_sales_increase`:** For each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` appends the difference \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\). After the loop completes, `potential_sales_increase` will also have `n` elements, each representing this difference.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0 initially or becomes 0 during the loop due to `f` being less than 1), the variables retain their initial values:
- **`n`:** Will be 0.
- **`f`:** Will be 0 if `f` was initially 0 or became 0 during the loop.
- **`days`:** Remains the same list.
- **`regular_sales`:** Will be an empty list.
- **`potential_sales_increase`:** Will be an empty list.

This covers all possible scenarios based on the loop's behavior and the given constraints.
