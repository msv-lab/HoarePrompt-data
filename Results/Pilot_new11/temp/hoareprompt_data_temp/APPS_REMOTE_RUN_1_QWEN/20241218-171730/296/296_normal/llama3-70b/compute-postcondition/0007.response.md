The code `print('1', n // 2)` prints the string '1' followed by the integer division of `n` by 2. Given that `n` is an integer input within the range [2, 10^9] and `n` is not equal to 2, the value of `n // 2` will be an integer. The print statement does not affect the values of `n` or `k`, but it changes the output. The value of `k` remains 2. The strings 'YES' and '2' were printed before this code, and those outputs remain unchanged.

Output State: **'YES' was printed, '2' was printed, `n` is an integer input within the range [2, 10^9] and `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, the output is '1' followed by `n // 2**
