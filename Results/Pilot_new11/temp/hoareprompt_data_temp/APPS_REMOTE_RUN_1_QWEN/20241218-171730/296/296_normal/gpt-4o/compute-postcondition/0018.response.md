`divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i_end + 2`. Since `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, and `i` is now `i_end + 2`, it means `i` is not in the range of the divisors already present in `divisors`. Thus, `n // i` will be appended to `divisors`. The states of `n` and `i_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients plus the value `n // (i_end + 2)'; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
