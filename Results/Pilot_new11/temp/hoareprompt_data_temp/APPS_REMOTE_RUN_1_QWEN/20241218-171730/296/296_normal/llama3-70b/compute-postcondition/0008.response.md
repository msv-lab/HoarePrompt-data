The code `print('1', n)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer input within the range [2, \(10^9\)] and `n` is not equal to 2, and considering the initial state where 'YES' was printed and '2' was printed, the output of this print statement will be '1' followed by the value of `n`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **'YES' was printed, '2' was printed, `n` is an integer input within the range [2, \(10^9\)] and `n` is not equal to 2, the output is '1' followed by `n`**
