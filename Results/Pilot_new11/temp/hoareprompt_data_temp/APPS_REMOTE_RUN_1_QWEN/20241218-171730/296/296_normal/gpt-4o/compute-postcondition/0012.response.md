`i` is assigned the value of `k + 1`, and then the `append` method is used to add `i` to the list `divisors`. Since `i` was previously `k + 1`, it is now added to `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates, and including `i` (which is `k + 1`); `i` is `k + 1`**
