Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not generate a sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program only handles the case when `n` is 2 by printing "NO", but it fails to generate the correct sequence of fractions for other values of `n`. For example, consider `n = 6`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 3
```

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. It always prints "YES" and a fixed sequence regardless of the input value of `n`. This means it does not properly check if a valid sequence of fractions can be formed for a given `n` and does not dynamically adjust the sequence based on the input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
