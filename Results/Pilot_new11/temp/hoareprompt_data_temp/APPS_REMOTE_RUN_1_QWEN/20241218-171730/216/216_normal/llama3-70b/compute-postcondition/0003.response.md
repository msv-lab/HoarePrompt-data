The code `print(len(lowercase))` will print the length of the `lowercase` list, which is the number of lowercase characters in the string `s`. However, the actual value of `len(lowercase)` is not provided here, so we can only state that `len(lowercase)` is printed.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `s` is a string obtained from the input, `lowercase` is a list of integers containing the indices of all lowercase characters in `s`, and the length of `lowercase` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the input, `s` is a string obtained from the input, `lowercase` is a list of integers containing the indices of all lowercase characters in `s`, and the length of `lowercase` is printed.**
