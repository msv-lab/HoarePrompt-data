The code initializes `max_count` to 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state because no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the only new information introduced is that `max_count` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\); `s` is a string input by the user; `max_count` is 0**
