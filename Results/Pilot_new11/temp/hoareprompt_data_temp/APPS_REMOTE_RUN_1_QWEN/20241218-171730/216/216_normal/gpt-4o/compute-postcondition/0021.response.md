The code `current_set.clear()` clears the contents of the `current_set` set. Since `current_set` was previously an empty set, clearing it does not change its state. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks and is either the same as the previous `max_count` or increased by 1 if `current_count` was 1, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 1 if the current character was lowercase and not in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` is 0.**
