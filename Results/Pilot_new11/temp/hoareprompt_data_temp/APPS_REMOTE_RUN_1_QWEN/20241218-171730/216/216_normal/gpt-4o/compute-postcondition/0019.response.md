Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` contains the character `char`, and `current_count` is incremented by 1 (either becoming 1 or 2).***
