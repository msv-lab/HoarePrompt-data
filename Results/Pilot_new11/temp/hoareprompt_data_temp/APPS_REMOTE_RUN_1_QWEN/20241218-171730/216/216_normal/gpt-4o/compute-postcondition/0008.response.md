The code adds the current character of `s` to `current_set`. Since the current character of `s` is lowercase and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will contain this character after the addition. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing one character (the current character of `s`), `current_count` is 0, the current character of `s` is lowercase, and the current character of `s` is in `current_set`**
