The code initializes a new set called `current_set`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `max_count`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\); `s` is a string input by the user; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set**
