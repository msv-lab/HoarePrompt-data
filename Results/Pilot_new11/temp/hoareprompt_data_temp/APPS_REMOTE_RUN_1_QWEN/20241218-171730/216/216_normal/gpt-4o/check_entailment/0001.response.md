Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where there are multiple sequences of lowercase letters with uppercase letters in between. Specifically, the program only resets the `current_set` and `current_count` when it encounters an uppercase letter, but it does not consider the possibility of having multiple sequences of lowercase letters that are separated by uppercase letters.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The program would output `2`, but the correct answer should be `4` because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions can be `{6, 7, 9, 10}`. The program fails to account for multiple sequences of lowercase letters that are not adjacent.
