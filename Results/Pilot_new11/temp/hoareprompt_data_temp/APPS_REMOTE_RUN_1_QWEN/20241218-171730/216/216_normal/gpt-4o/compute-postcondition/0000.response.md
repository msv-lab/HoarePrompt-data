The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), after executing the code, the value of `n` will still satisfy this condition. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\); `s` consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
