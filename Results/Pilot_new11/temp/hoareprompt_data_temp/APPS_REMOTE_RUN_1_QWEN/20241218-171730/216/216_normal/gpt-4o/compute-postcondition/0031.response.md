Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, considering the new character. `current_set` may contain the new character `char` if it is a lowercase character not previously in `current_set`, and `current_count` is incremented by 1 if `char` is a lowercase character not previously in `current_set`; otherwise, `current_count` remains unchanged. If the else part is executed, `max_count` is the maximum between its original value and 1, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.***
