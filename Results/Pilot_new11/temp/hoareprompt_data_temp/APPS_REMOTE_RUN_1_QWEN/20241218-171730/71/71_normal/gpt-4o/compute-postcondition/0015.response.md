`to_remove` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `to_remove` is 1, so after the increment, `to_remove` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` remains unchanged, `to_remove` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` remains unchanged, `to_remove` is 2**
