`n` is divided by 10 using integer division (`//`). The value of `w` was increased by 1 in the initial state, but the value of `w` itself is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `w` remains the same as it was before (i.e., `w` is increased by 1). The value of `n` is updated to its integer quotient when divided by 10.

Output State: **`w` is increased by 1; `n` is the integer quotient of `n` divided by 10**
