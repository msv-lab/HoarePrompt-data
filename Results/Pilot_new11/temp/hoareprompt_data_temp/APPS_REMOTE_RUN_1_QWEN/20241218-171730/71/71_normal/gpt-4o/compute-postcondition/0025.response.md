Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where the condition `count_zeros == k` is met, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits encountered until the condition `count_zeros == k` is met, or `to_remove` is equal to the length of the remaining string if the loop does not break.**
