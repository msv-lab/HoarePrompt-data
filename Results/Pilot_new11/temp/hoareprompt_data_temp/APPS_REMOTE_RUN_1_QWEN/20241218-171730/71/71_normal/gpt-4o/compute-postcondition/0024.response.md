Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is either 2 or 3. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
