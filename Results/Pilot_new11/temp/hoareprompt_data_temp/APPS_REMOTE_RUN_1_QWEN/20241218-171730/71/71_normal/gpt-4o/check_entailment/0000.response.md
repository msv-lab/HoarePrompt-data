Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the number `n` itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). Specifically, if the last `k` digits of `n` form a number that is divisible by \(10^k\), the program incorrectly counts these digits as part of the digits to remove.

For example, consider the input:
- Input: `1000 3`

The expected output is `0`, as the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\). However, the program will incorrectly count all digits except the first one, resulting in an output of `3`.

To fix this, the program should check if the last `k` digits form a number divisible by \(10^k\) before proceeding with the count. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n[:-k]):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
    if n[-k:] != '0' * k:
        to_remove += 1
    print(to_remove)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that if the last `k` digits are already forming a number divisible by \(10^k\), no additional digits are counted for removal.
