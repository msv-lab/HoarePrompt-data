Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if the current digit is '0'; otherwise, `count_zeros` remains unchanged and `to_remove` is set to 1 if the current digit is not '0'. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the same conditions apply if `count_zeros` does not equal `k`.***
