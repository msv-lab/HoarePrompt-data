To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the variables change within each iteration. Specifically, we need to focus on how `num` and `mex` are updated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `num` was compared to `mex`.
   - If `num` was greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` was increased by 1.
   - If `num` was less than `mex`, `mex` remained unchanged.

2. **Current Iteration**:
   - For the current iteration, `num` will be the next value from the list `a`.

3. **Update Conditions**:
   - If the current `num` (let's call it `num_current`) is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` will be increased by 1.
   - If `num_current` is less than `mex`, then `mex` will remain unchanged.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - The value of `num` will be `num_current` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `mex` will depend on the comparison between `num_current` and the current `mex`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `num` is `num_current` (the next value from the list `a`).
- `mex` is either the current `mex` (if `num_current` is less than `mex`) or `mex + 1` (if `num_current` is greater than or equal to `mex`).

Since we don't know the exact value of `num_current` yet, we express the state as follows:

**State: **`num` is the next value from the list `a`, `mex` is either the current `mex` or `mex + 1` depending on the comparison**.
