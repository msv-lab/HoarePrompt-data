Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list (i.e., `arr[i+1]`), `mex` remains unchanged if `num` does not equal `mex`, and if `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
