The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `mex`. This initializes `mex` to `1`. The value of `n` and the content of the list `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mex` and retains the initial state of `n` and `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order; `mex` is 1**
