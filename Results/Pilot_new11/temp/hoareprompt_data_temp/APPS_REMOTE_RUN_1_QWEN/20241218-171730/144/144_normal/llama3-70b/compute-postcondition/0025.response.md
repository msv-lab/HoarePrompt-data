Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers from the standard input. It then sorts the array of integers in ascending order. After sorting, the function iterates through the array to find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. If all integers from 1 to \( n \) are present in the array, the function returns \( n+1 \). The function prints the result to the standard output.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the array contains all integers from 1 to \( n \) without any gaps, the function correctly returns \( n+1 \).
- If the array is empty, the function will sort an empty list and initialize `mex` to 1, then return 1.
- If the array contains no positive integers (e.g., all zeros or negative numbers), the function will still correctly identify 1 as the smallest missing positive integer and return it.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where the array contains duplicate integers. While the code sorts the array and checks for the smallest missing positive integer, it does not account for duplicates. However, since the `mex` (minimum excluded) value is determined by the presence of unique values, duplicates do not affect the outcome. Therefore, this is not a missing functionality but rather an implicit handling by the logic.
