The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `a`. Since the initial value of `n` is only known to be an integer between 1 and 100,000, and no action is taken on `n` within the given code snippet, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a list of integers (values depend on user input)**
