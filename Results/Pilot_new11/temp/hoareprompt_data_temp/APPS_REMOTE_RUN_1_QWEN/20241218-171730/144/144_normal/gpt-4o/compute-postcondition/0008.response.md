Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
   - `mex` is 2.
   - `num` (which is `n` in this context) is greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for num in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, the first iteration of the loop would have already processed one element from `a`.
   - The variable `num` takes the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to take the value of the next element in the list `a`.
   - Given that `a` is a non-empty sorted list, the next element in the list will be the next value in the sequence of integers.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `n` (or `num`) will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `mex` is 2, the next value of `num` should be the smallest integer greater than the current value of `num` if it was 2 (since the list is sorted and contains consecutive integers starting from some value).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `n` (or `num`) will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `mex` remains unchanged since it does not depend on the loop variable `num`.

**State:**
- `n` (or `num`) is the next element in the list `a`.
- `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `mex` is still 2.

Since `num` (or `n`) is greater than or equal to 1, and the list `a` is non-empty, the next value of `num` will be the smallest integer in the list `a` that is greater than the current `num`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` (or `num`) is the next element in the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `mex` is 2.**
