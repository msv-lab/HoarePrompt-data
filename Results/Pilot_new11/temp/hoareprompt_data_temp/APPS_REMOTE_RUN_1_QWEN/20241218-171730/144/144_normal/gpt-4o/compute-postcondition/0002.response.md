The `sort()` method is called on list `a`, which sorts the list in ascending order. Since the exact values in the list are not provided, we know that `a` will be sorted, but the specific values remain unknown. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of integers.**
