The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input from the second line, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The first line's input, which is the integer `n`, does not change.

Therefore, after executing this line of code, the integer `n` will be an input integer, and the list `arr` will contain `n` integers from the second line of input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of `n` integers**
