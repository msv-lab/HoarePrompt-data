According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The key points to consider are:

1. Whether the loop can continue based on the current value of `num`.
2. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1.
3. If `num` is greater than the maximum element in `arr`, the loop breaks.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element.
- If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1.
- If `num` is greater than the maximum element in `arr`, we break out of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in `arr` that is less than the current maximum element in `arr`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element.
   - Let's assume the current `num` is `arr[i]`.
   - If `num` equals `mex`, `mex` is increased by 1.
   - If `num` is greater than the maximum element in `arr`, the loop breaks.

2. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must be the next element in `arr` and it must not be greater than the maximum element in `arr`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the next `num` will be `arr[i+1]`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged if `num` does not equal `mex`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `arr` remains the same.
- `num` becomes the next element in `arr`, which is `arr[i+1]`.
- `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex`.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list (i.e., `arr[i+1]`), `mex` remains unchanged if `num` does not equal `mex`**
