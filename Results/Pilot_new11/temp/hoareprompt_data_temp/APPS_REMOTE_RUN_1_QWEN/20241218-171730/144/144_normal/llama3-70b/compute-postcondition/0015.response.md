Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element. If `num` is greater than the maximum element in `arr`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged (i.e., `num` is still the next element in the list `arr` and the list remains sorted).***
