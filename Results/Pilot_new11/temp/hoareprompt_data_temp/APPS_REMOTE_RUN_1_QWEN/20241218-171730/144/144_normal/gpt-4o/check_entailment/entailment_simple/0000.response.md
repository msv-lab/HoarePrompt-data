Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the first line to get the number of elements `n` in the array.
   - It then reads the second line to get the elements of the array and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the minimum missing positive integer.

3. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value of Mex**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
   - The program iterates through each element in the sorted array. For each element, it checks if the current element `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`.
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it means `mex` is already present in the array, so `mex` is incremented by 1.
   - This process ensures that the smallest missing positive integer is found.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the value of `mex` is printed, which is the maximum possible value of mex after performing the allowed operations.

The program correctly handles all cases within the constraints provided in the problem description:
- It accepts valid inputs (non-negative integers).
- It sorts the array to ensure the mex calculation is efficient.
- It correctly determines the smallest missing positive integer by iterating through the sorted array.

Since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
