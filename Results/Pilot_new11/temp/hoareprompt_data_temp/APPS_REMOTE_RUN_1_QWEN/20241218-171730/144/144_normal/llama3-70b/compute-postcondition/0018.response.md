`mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` and the list `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `mex` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `mex` is incremented by 1**
