Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not calculate the maximum possible value of the mex (minimum positive integer that does not appear in the array after performing the allowed operations). Instead, it finds the smallest missing positive integer from the sorted array without considering the possibility of reducing elements to achieve a higher mex.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `arr`. While sorting is a valid step, it does not help in finding the maximum possible mex directly. Sorting is not necessary for solving the problem, and it can be misleading.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic checks if each element in the sorted array matches the current `mex`. If it matches, `mex` is incremented. However, this approach only finds the smallest missing positive integer from the original array, not the maximum possible mex.

3. **Breaking the Loop**: The loop breaks if the current element in the array is greater than `mex`. This is incorrect because the goal is to maximize `mex`, not minimize it. Breaking the loop early prevents the program from considering the full range of possible values for `mex`.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should use a different approach. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize mex to 1
    mex = 1
    
    # Find the smallest element in the array
    min_val = min(arr)
    
    # If the smallest element is 1, we can set mex to 2 immediately
    if min_val == 1:
        mex = 2
    else:
        # Otherwise, the maximum possible mex is the smallest element + 1
        mex = min_val + 1
    
    print(mex)

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initialization**: Start with `mex` initialized to 1.
2. **Find Minimum Element**: Determine the smallest element in the array.
3. **Set Mex**:
   - If the smallest element is 1, the mex can be set to 2 immediately because 1 is already in the array.
   - Otherwise, the maximum possible mex is the smallest element + 1. This ensures that we can reduce other elements to make 1 the smallest missing positive integer.

This approach correctly implements the problem requirements and ensures the maximum possible mex is calculated.
