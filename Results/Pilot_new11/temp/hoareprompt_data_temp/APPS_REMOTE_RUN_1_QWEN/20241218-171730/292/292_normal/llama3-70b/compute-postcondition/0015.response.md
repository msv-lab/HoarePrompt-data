The code `print(years)` prints the value of the variable `years`. Since the initial state does not specify an exact value for `years`, it will print whatever value `years` holds, which is the number of iterations the loop executed. However, no changes are made to the values of `a` or `b` by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6 \* 3 \* 3 \* ... (times `years`), `b` is less than or equal to 16, 32, 48, 64, or 80 (depending on the value of `years`), and `years` is printed**
