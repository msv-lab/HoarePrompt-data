Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The program counts the number of years it takes for this condition to be met and prints the result.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the program will always terminate within a finite number of steps because the weights are growing exponentially. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
