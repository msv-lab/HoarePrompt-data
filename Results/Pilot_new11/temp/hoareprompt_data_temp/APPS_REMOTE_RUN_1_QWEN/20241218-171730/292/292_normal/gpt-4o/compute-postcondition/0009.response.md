`years` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `years` is not specified in the initial state. However, the initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 9 or 18; `b` is a value between 4 and 20; `years` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is 9 or 18; `b` is a value between 4 and 20; `years` is increased by 1**
