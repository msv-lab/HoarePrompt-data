The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning the results to `a` and `b`. Since the input is split into two integers, `a` and `b` will each take one of the input values, and both will be integers. The precondition that `1 <= a <= b <= 10` will still hold true after the code execution.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10**
