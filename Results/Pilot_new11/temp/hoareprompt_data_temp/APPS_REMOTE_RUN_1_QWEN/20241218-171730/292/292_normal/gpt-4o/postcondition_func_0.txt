The function processes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) and calculates the minimum number of years required for `a` to become greater than `b` through repeated tripling of `a` and doubling of `b`. It then prints this number of years. If `a` is already greater than `b` at the start, the function will still execute the loop once to update `a` and `b`, but the number of years will be reported as 1. There are no explicit return parameters; the function directly outputs the result.
