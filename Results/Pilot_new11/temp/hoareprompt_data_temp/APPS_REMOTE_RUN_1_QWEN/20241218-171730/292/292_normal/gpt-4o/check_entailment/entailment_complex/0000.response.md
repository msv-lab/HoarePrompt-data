Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) as input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Weight Calculation**: The program uses a loop to repeatedly triple Limak's weight (\(a\)) and double Bob's weight (\(b\)), incrementing the year counter each time until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. This accurately models the scenario described in the problem.

3. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues as long as \(a \leq b\). Once \(a > b\), the loop exits, ensuring that the minimum number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob is counted and printed.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years, which is the output specified in the problem statement.

Since the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement without any additional error checks or assumptions beyond those stated, it meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
