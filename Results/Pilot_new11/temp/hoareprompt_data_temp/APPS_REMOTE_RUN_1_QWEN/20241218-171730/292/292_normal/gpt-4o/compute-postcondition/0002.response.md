Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).
   - `years` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `a <= b`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to adjust the states such that the loop can execute at least one time.

4. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop `while a <= b` to execute at least once, the condition `a <= b` must be true.
   - Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers with \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the condition `a <= b` is already satisfied in the given constraints.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the initial conditions already satisfy the loop's condition, no adjustment to the states is necessary for the loop to execute at least one time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**Answer:**
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\); `years` is 0**
