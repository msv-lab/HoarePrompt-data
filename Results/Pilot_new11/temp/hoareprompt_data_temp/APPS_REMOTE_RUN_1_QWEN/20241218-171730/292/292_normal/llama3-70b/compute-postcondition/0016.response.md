The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The function returns a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

However, since no specific return conditions are provided in the given output, we can only describe the parameter constraints and the general structure of the function's behavior based on the input parameters.
