The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional block but does not modify the values of any variables. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that `break` would terminate, the only effect is that the program exits whatever block it was in. However, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `counts` is a non-empty list, `result` is undefined**
