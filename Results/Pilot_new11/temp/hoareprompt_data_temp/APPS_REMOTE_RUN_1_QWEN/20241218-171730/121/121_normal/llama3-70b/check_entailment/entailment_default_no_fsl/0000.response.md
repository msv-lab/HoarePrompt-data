Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where it is impossible to decode the genome such that each type of nucleotide appears an equal number of times. Specifically, if the total number of nucleotides is not divisible by 4, or if the number of '?' characters is more than the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', the code will still attempt to fill the gaps, leading to an incorrect output or failing to recognize the impossibility of a solution. For example, in the case "AA??", the code will try to replace the two '?' characters, but since it cannot balance the counts of 'A' and the other nucleotides, it should print "===" instead of attempting a replacement.
