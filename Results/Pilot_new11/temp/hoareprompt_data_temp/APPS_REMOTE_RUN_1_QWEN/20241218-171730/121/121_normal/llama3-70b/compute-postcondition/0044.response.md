Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`, `count` is a dictionary with keys `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and their values updated such that each key's value is `avg - count[key]` for all characters in the string `s`, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` is `'?'`, `res` is an empty string; otherwise, `res` is a string with `c` appended to it.***
