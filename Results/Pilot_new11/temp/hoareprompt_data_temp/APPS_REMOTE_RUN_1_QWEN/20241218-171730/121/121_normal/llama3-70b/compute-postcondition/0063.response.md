Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'`, `count` is updated based on the current character `c`, `avg` is `n // 4`, and if `c` is not `'?'`, `res` is a string with `c` appended to it; otherwise, `res` remains an empty string. Additionally, the current character `c` is not `'?'`.**
