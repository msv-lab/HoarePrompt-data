The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `data`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`], where `s` is the string from `data[1]`. The value of `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 0.**
