The code `res += nc` increments `res` by the ASCII value of `nc`. Given that `nc` is 'A', its ASCII value is 65. Therefore, `res` is updated to `res + 65`.

The initial state is:
- `nc` is 'A'
- `count['A']` is 0
- `res` is 98

After executing the code:
- `res` becomes `98 + 65 = 163`

The output state is:
Output State: **`nc` is 'A', `count['A']` is 0, `res` is 163**
