`counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The value of `char` is known from the initial state, and `counts` has at least one element, but the exact value of `counts[char]` before the increment is not specified. The value of `i` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `result[1]` is `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `result[1]` is `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.**
