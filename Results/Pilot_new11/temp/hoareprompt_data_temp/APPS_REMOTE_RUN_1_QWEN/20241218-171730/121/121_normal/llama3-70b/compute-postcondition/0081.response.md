The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or switch statement. Given the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nc` is 'C', `count['C']` is 0, `res` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or switch statement.**
