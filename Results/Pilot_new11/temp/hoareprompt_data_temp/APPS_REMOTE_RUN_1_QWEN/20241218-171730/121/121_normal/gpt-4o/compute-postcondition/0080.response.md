The code `break` is used to exit the loop or the most nested block it is inside. Since there is no loop or nested block in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `counts` is a non-empty list, `result[2]` is equal to `char`, and the count of `char` in `counts` is now less than `target_count` + 1**
