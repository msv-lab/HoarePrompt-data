The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, it simply breaks out of any loop or if statement that might be present. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nc` is one of 'C', 'G', or 'T', `count['A']` is 0, `res` is 1 plus the ASCII code of `nc`, `count[nc]` is the original value of `count[nc]` minus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
