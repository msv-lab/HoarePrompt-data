Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and possibly `'?'`, `count` is a dictionary with keys `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` and their values updated such that either at least one key's value is greater than 0 or all values are `0`, `avg` is `n // 4`, and `res` is a string formed by replacing each `'?'` in `s` with one of `'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'` while respecting the count constraints, or appending the corresponding character from `s` if it is not `'?'`. Printed: `===` if any count value is greater than 0, otherwise the value of `res` is printed.***
