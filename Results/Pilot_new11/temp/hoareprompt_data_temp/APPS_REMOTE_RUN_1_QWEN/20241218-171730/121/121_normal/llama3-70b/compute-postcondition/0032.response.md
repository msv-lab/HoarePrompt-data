`res` is incremented by `nc`. Since `nc` is one of 'C', 'G', or 'T', the value of `res` will be updated accordingly. The initial value of `res` is 1. Therefore, if `nc` is 'C', 'G', or 'T', `res` will become 1 plus the respective character, which in this context means it will become a numerical value representing the ASCII code of the character plus 1.

Output State: **`nc` is one of 'C', 'G', or 'T', `count['A']` is 0, `res` is 1 plus the ASCII code of `nc`**
