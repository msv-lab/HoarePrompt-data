Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more than the required number of any nucleotide type. Specifically, if the counts of any nucleotide exceed the target count (`target_count`), the program should print "===" and exit. However, the program does not check if the sum of the counts of all nucleotides and question marks exceeds the total number of nucleotides required for each type to be equal. 

For example, consider the input:
```
8
AAAAAAAT
```
The program will calculate that `target_count` is 2 for each nucleotide type but will not check if the sum of the counts of 'A' (6) and the remaining nucleotides ('T', which is 1) exceeds the total required for each type to be equal. Since 6 is greater than 2, the genome cannot be decoded correctly, but the program will incorrectly output a valid sequence like "AAAAAAAT".

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the total number of nucleotides and question marks does not exceed the necessary number for each type to be equal.
