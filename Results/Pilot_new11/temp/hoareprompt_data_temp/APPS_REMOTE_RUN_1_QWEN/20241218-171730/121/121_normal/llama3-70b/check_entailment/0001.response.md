Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Here's why:

1. **Counting Known Nucleotides**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the given string `s`.

2. **Calculating the Average**: It calculates the average number of each type of nucleotide needed to balance the genome.

3. **Replacing Question Marks**: It iterates through the string `s` and replaces each '?' with one of the four nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that the count of each nucleotide becomes equal.

4. **Validation**: After replacing the question marks, it checks if the count of each nucleotide is indeed equal. If not, it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

Given the logic and the approach used, the program should work for all valid inputs. Since the provided examples and the logical steps align with the problem description, the program is correct.
