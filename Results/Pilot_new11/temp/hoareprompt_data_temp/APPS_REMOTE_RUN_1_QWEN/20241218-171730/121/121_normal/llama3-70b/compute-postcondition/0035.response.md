Postcondition: ***`nc` is one of 'C', 'G', or 'T', `count['A']` is 0, and `res` is 1 plus the ASCII code of `nc`. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count[nc]` and `res` remains unchanged.***
