`cnt2` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `cnt1` remains unchanged, as well as `cnt0` and `cnt3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is 0.

Output State: **`cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is 0**
