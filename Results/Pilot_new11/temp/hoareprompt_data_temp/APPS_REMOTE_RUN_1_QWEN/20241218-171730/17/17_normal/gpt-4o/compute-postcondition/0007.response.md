The code `print(0)` does not affect any variables, it only prints the integer `0`. The variables `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is an integer input from the user, `cnt4` is an integer input from the user, and either `cnt1 + cnt2` is not equal to `cnt3 + cnt4` or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`.**
