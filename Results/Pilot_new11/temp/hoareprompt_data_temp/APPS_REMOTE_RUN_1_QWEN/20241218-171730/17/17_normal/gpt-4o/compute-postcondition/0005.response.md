The code `print(1)` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints the number 1 to the console. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is an integer input from the user, `cnt4` is an integer input from the user, and the condition `(cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)` is true**
