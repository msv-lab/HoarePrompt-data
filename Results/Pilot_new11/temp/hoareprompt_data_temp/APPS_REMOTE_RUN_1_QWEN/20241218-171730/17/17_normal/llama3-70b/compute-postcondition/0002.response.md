The code `print(0)` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the number 0 to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer, and the current value of `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`.**
