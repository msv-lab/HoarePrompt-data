The function reads four integers from the user, each representing the counts of the string patterns "(((、“", “()”, and “)("” respectively. It then compares the count of ")((“ (`cnt3`) with the count of "(((、“ (`cnt1`). If the count of ")((“ is greater than the count of "(((、“, it prints 0 to the console. Otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output based on the comparison result. There are no additional actions performed beyond printing 0 or 1 to the console.
