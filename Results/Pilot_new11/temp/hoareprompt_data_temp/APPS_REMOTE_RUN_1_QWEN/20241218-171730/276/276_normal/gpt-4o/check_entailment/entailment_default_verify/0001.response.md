Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program incorrectly implements the calculation of the golden system value. The function `func_1` uses `q ** (n - i - 1)` instead of `q ** (n - i)` in its loop, which leads to incorrect values being computed. For instance, considering the input `1000` and `111`:

- The correct value for `1000` should be \(q^3\).
- The program incorrectly calculates it as \(q^2\).

This discrepancy causes the program to produce incorrect results for many inputs, as demonstrated in the example provided. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the golden system conversion, leading to incorrect comparisons between numbers.
