Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion of a number from the golden system to its decimal representation using the `func_1` function. The main part of the program then correctly compares the decimal values of the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`).

The annotated version clearly shows that the program handles each step correctly:
- The input strings `a` and `b` are valid and represent numbers in the golden system.
- The `func_1` function iterates over the reversed string, converting each digit to its decimal contribution and summing these contributions.
- After computing the decimal values, the program compares them and prints the correct symbol.

Since the annotations align with the problem description and the code, there is no indication that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
