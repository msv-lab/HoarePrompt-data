Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from the golden system to its decimal representation using the function `func_1`. The main part of the program compares the decimal values of two numbers converted from the golden system and prints the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on their comparison. The function `func_1` iterates over each digit in reverse order, multiplies it by the corresponding power of the golden ratio \( q \), and accumulates the result, which covers all possible inputs, including edge cases such as a single-digit string. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly without any missing functionality or edge cases that would make it incorrect.
