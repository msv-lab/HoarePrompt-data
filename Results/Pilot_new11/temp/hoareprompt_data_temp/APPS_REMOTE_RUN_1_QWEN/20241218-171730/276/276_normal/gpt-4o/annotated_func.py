#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is 5, `value` is the sum of `5^(n - i - 1)` for each `i` where `s[i]` is '1', `n` is the length of `s`.
    return value
    #The program returns the sum of \(5^{n - i - 1}\) for each \(i\) where \(s[i]\) is '1' and \(n\) is the length of string \(s\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` which is a non-empty binary string representing a number in the golden system. It calculates and returns the sum of \(5^{n - i - 1}\) for each position `i` where `s[i]` is '1', and `n` is the length of the string `s`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but we can infer that the function assumes `s` is always a valid non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1'. The function iterates over each character in `s`, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of 5 to the `value` variable. After the loop, the function returns the computed `value`. The overall effect of the function is to convert a specific type of binary string into a numerical value based on a unique weighting system.
