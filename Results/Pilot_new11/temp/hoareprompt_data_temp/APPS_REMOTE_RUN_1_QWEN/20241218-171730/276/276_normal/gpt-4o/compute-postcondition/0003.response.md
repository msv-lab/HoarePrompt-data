Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
   - `q` is the value of `5`.
   - `value` is `0`.
   - `n` is the length of string `s`.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(n)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `range(n)` does not include `n` itself).

3. **Identify States That Need Adjustment:**
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` (the length of `s`) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the value of `5`.
   - `value` remains `0` as it is not modified in the given information.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `q` is 5, `value` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
