The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` which is a non-empty binary string representing a number in the golden system. It calculates and returns the sum of \(5^{n - i - 1}\) for each position `i` where `s[i]` is '1', and `n` is the length of the string `s`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but we can infer that the function assumes `s` is always a valid non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1'. The function iterates over each character in `s`, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of 5 to the `value` variable. After the loop, the function returns the computed `value`. The overall effect of the function is to convert a specific type of binary string into a numerical value based on a unique weighting system.
