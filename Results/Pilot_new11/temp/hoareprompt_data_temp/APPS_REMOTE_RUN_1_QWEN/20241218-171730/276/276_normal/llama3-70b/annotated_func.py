#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `s` - 1, `c` is the last character of the original string `s`, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is the decimal representation of the golden system number represented by `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the golden system number represented by string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, which represents a number in the golden system. It calculates the decimal representation of this golden system number by iterating over each digit in `s` in reverse order, multiplying each digit by \( q^i \) where \( q \) is the golden ratio \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\) and \( i \) is the index starting from 0. After executing the loop, the function returns the calculated decimal value. This process covers all possible inputs, including edge cases such as a single-digit string, and correctly computes the decimal equivalent without any missing functionality.
