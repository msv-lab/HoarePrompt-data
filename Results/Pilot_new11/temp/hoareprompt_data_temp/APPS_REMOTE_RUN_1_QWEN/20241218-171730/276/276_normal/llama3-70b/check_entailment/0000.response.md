Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the comparison of two numbers in the golden system. It converts each number from the golden system to its decimal representation using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The logic in the main part of the program is also correct, printing the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on the comparison of the decimal values. Given the nature of the golden ratio and the described conversion method, the program should handle all valid inputs correctly without any edge cases missed.
