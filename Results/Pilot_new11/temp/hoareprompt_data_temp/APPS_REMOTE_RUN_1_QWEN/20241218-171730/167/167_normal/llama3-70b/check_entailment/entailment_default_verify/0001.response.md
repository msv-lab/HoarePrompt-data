Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Although the function `func_1` correctly checks if each move in the path is adjacent, it fails to handle certain edge cases, particularly when the path involves wrapping around the boundaries of the matrix. For instance, the input sequence `1 2 1 2 5 3` demonstrates that the program incorrectly accepts a sequence that should be invalid according to the problem description. The path from cell 1 to cell 2, then back to cell 1, and then to cell 2 again does not form a valid path since it involves revisiting cells without proper adjacency. Therefore, the program does not fully comply with the problem requirements and should be considered incorrect.
