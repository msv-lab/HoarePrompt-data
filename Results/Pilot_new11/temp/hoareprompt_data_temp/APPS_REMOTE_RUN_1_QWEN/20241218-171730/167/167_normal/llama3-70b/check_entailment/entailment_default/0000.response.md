Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks whether a given path is valid for a matrix of size `x` by `y`. However, the code does not correctly validate the path for every potential case.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix is constructed such that `A[i][j] = y*(i-1) + j`. Given this construction, a move from one cell to another is valid if the difference in row indices plus the difference in column indices equals 1 (i.e., the Manhattan distance between two cells is 1).

2. **Path Validation**: The function `func_1` calculates the coordinates `(nx, ny)` for each number `v` in the sequence using the formula `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y`. It then checks if the Manhattan distance between the current position and the next position is exactly 1. However, this check alone is not sufficient to validate the entire path. The function should also ensure that each step in the path is either a horizontal or vertical move.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks the Manhattan distance for each step in the path, but it does not account for the possibility of invalid intermediate steps.
   - For example, consider the path `1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2` from the first test case. The function correctly identifies that the path can be valid in a 3x3 grid. However, if the path were `1 2 1 2 5 3`, the function would incorrectly validate the path even though the second "1" does not follow a valid move from the first "1".

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` fails to correctly validate the path for certain cases, making the overall program incorrect. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
