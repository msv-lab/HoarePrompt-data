Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of cells `n` and the sequence of integers `a` from the input. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Matrix Dimensions and Path Validity Check**:
   - The program iterates over all possible dimensions `x` and `y` up to `10^6` (though it breaks early if `x * y` exceeds the maximum value in `a`). This ensures that it checks all possible dimensions within the constraints.
   - It verifies that all integers in `a` are within the range `[1, x * y]`, which is necessary for the matrix construction.
   - It calls the `func_1(x, y)` function to check if the path is valid given the dimensions `x` and `y`.

3. **Path Validation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` initializes the starting position `(px, py)` at `(0, 0)`.
   - It iterates through each number in `a` to determine its position `(nx, ny)` in the matrix using the formula `(v - 1) // y` for the row and `(v - 1) % y` for the column.
   - It checks if the Manhattan distance between consecutive positions `(px, py)` and `(nx, ny)` is exactly 1, ensuring that each move is to an adjacent cell.
   - If all moves are valid, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the program prints `YES` followed by the dimensions `x` and `y` and exits.
   - If no valid dimensions are found after checking all possibilities, it prints `NO`.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring that it checks all possible dimensions and validates the path according to the rules specified. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
