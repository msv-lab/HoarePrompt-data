Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is \((v' - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v' - 1) \% y\), `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `v` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\). If \(|nx - px| + |ny - py| \neq 1\), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or returns the same state as the if condition).***
