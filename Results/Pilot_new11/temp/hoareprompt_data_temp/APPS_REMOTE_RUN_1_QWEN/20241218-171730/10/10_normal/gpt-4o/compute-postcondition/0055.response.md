`left_count[i]` is assigned the value of `left_count[i] + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `top_count[0]` is unchanged, `right_count[0]` remains unchanged, `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
