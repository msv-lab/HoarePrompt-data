Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the number of sofas (`d`), dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas in different directions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Sofa Representation**:
   - Each sofa is represented as a tuple of coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. This representation is consistent with the problem statement, where a sofa covers two neighboring cells.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. It correctly counts these based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
   - The logic inside the function ensures that:
     - `left` counts sofas to the left in the same row.
     - `right` counts sofas to the right in the same row.
     - `top` counts sofas above in the same column.
     - `bottom` counts sofas below in the same column.
   - This matches the conditions described in the problem.

4. **Matching Conditions**:
   - The main loop iterates over all sofas and uses the `func_1` function to get the counts for each sofa.
   - If the counts match the provided `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, it prints the index of the sofa (1-based index) and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no matching sofa is found, it prints `-1`.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The program outputs the index of the sofa if it exists, or `-1` if no such sofa exists. This aligns with the problem description’s requirement to output the sofa number or `-1`.

Given that the program correctly parses the input, represents sofas, calculates the required counts, and checks against the given conditions, it meets the problem description accurately in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
