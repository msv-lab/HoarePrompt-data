Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`. If `i == j`, then either `top_count[0]` is increased by 1 if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, or `right_count[0]` is increased by 1 otherwise.***
