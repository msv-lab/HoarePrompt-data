Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`; if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and both `bottom_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `top_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
