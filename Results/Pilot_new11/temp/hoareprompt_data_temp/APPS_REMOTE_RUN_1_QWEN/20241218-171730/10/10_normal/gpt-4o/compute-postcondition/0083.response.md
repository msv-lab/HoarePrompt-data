Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `d` is greater than 0. Since the condition `i == j` is true in the if part, all the variables retain their original values as specified in the precondition.***
