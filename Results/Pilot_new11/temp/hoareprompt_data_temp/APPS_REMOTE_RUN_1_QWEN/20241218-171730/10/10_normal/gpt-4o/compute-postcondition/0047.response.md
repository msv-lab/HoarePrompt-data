`top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 0, `top_count[0]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `top_count[0]` is increased by 1, and `right_count[0]` remains unchanged.**
