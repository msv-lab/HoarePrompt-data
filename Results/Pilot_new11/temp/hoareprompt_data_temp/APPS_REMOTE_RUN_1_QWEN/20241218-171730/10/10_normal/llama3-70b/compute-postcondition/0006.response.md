Postcondition: ***`sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. Additionally, the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s`. If the condition `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]` is true, then `left` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***

Explanation: 
- The precondition already states the initial conditions for the variables `sofas`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, and `s`.
- Since the `if` condition is `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]`, and this condition is being checked, we need to ensure that the postcondition reflects that the condition is not met.
- Therefore, `left` remains 0, as the condition for setting `left` to 1 (`sofa[0][0] < s[0][0]`) does not apply here.
- The values of `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged at 0, as they are not affected by the `if` condition.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged as per the precondition, and the condition that the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s` is retained.
