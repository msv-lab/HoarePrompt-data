Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa. The main loop iterates through each sofa and uses `func_1` to check if the counts match the given `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. If a matching sofa is found, the program prints the index of that sofa and breaks the loop. If no matching sofa is found, the program prints `-1`.

The output hints further confirm this by describing the behavior of the `func_1` function in detail. Although the hints mention that the function does not handle the case where `sofas` is an empty list, this is not a concern given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
