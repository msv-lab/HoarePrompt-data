Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` is greater than 0. The condition `(x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j)` holds true, and `right_count[i]` is 1.***
