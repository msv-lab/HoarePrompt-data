Postcondition: ***`sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. If `s` is not equal to the first element of `sofas` and `sofa[0][1] > s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1. Otherwise, `left` remains 0, `right` remains 0, `top` remains 0, and `bottom` remains 0.***
