The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and simply exits the loop or the innermost enclosing structure. Since no such structure is specified in the given code snippet, we assume that the `break` statement is used to exit the loop involving `i` and `j`. However, since the loop structure is not explicitly shown, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, where `d` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `d`.
- `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`.
- `left_count[i]` is 0.
- `right_count[i]` is 0.
- `top_count[i]` is 0.
- `bottom_count[i]` is 0.
- `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries.
- `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries.
- `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries.
- `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries.
- `target_sofa` is `d + 1`.

After the `break` statement, the values of `i` and `j` remain the same, and all other variables retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `left_count[i]` is 0, `right_count[i]` is 0, `top_count[i]` is 0, `bottom_count[i]` is 0, `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries, `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries, `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries, `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries, `target_sofa` is `d + 1` and we break out of the loop involving `i` and `j`.**
