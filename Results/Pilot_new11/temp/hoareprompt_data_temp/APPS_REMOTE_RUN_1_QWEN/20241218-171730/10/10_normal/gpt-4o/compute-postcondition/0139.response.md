Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. Since the condition `i == j` is false, the else part does not execute, and the values remain as initially specified.***
