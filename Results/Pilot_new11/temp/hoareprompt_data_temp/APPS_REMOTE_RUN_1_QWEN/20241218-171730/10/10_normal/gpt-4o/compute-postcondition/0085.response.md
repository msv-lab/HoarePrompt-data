`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0, so `right_count[0]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `right_count[0]` is 1.**
