`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` equals `j`, and no other variables are affected, the updated values are: `i` equals `j`, and `right_count[i]` is the original value of `right_count[i]` plus 1.

Output State: **`i` equals `j`, `right_count[i]` is the original value of `right_count[i]` plus 1**
