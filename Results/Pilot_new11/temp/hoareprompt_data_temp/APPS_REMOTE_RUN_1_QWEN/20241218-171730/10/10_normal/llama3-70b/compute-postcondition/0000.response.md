The code initializes four variables: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` to 0. It does not affect the values of the `sofa` tuple or the `sofas` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sofa` is a tuple containing the coordinates of a single sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), where x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers representing the row and column indices of the two cells covered by the sofa; `sofas` is a list of tuples, each representing the coordinates of a sofa in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2); `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
