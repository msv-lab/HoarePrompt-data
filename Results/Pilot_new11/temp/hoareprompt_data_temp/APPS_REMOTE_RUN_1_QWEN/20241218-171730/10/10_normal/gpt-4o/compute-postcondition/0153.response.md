Postcondition: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `d - 1`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `right_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `left_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `top_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries, `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries, `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries, `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are all lists of `d` zeros, `target_sofa` is -1, and the condition `(left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b)` is true**
