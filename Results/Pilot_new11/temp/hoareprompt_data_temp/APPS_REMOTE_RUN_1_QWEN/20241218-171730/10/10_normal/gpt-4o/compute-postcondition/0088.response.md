Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `right_count[0]` is 1. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
