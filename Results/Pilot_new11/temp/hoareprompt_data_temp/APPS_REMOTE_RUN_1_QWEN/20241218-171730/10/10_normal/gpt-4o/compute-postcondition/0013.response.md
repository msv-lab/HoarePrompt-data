`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `sofas` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is the number of times the loop executed, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple representing the coordinates of a sofa in the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`d` is the number of times the loop executed, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple representing the coordinates of a sofa in the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer**
