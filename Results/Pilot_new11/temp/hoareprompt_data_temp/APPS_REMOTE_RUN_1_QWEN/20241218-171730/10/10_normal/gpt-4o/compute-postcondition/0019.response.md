The code extracts four values (`x1, y1, x2, y2`) from the tuple in the `i`-th position of the `sofas` list and assigns them to the variables `x1, y1, x2, y2`. The variable `i` is also used in this assignment, meaning its value changes to `i` (which was initially set to 0 and iterates up to `d-1`). The other variables remain unaffected.

Given the initial state:
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples.
- `i` starts from 0 and iterates up to `d-1`.

After executing the line of code, the value of `i` is updated to the current index during iteration, and the values from the tuple at that index are assigned to `x1, y1, x2, y2`.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is the current index during iteration (0 â‰¤ `i` < `d`), `x1, y1, x2, y2` are the values from the tuple at index `i` of `sofas`.**
