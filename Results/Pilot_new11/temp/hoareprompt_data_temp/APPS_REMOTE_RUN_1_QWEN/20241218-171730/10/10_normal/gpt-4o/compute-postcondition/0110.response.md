The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `i` and `j` retain their initial values from the initial state. No changes are made to these variables within the scope of the given code.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `j`, and `j` is equal to `i`.**
