Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is a boolean value (either `True` or `False`), `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n + 1`. If the condition `rated` is `True`, the string 'rated' is printed to the console. Otherwise, if `unrated` is `True`, no changes are made; otherwise, the string 'maybe' is printed to the console.***
