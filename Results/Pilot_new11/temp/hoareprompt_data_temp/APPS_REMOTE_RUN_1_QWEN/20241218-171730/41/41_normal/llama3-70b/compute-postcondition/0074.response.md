To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and requirements step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop starts with `i` being equal to `n`.

2. **Understand the range of the loop:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the conditions under which the loop will execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at all, `i` must be less than `n` initially.
   - Given that `i` is initialized to `n`, the only way for the loop to execute is if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Identify other relevant variables:**
   - `unrated` is `False`.
   - `rated` is `False`.
   - `maybe` is `False`.
   - `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers.
   - `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `i` is set to `n` and the loop will run while `i < n`, the loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or negative.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

6. **Final state after adjustment:**
   - `unrated` remains `False`.
   - `rated` remains `False`.
   - `maybe` remains `False`.
   - `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`**.
