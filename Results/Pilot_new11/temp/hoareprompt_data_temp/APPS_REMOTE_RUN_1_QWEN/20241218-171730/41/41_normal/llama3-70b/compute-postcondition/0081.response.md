The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement present in the provided code, the `break` statement does not change the state of any variables. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `True`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`**
