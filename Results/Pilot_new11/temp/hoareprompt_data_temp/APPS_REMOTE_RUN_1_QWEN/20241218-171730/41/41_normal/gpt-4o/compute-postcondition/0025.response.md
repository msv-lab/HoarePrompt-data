The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, and `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]`.**
