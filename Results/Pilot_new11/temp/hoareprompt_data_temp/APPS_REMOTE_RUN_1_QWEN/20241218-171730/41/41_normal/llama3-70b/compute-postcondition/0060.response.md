Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, `i` is `0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block if there exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. If no such pair exists, the program continues without any changes to the mentioned variables and lists.***
