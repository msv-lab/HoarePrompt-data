The code `print('unrated')` simply prints the string 'unrated' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`unrated` is `True`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1**
