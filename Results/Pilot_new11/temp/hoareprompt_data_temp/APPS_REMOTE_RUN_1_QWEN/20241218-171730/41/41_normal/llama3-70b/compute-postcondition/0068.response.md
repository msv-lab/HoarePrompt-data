Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
