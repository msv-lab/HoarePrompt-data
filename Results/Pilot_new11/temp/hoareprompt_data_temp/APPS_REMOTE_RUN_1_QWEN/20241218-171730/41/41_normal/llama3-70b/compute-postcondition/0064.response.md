Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`. The condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is checked; if true, no changes occur. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the condition's evaluation.***
