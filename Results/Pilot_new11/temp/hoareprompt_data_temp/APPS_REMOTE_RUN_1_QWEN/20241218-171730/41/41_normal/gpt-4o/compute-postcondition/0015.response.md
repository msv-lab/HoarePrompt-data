According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` was greater than 1, `ratings` remained as `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, and `is_unrated` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (since it was already greater than 1, and we need it to be greater to execute another iteration).

The states remain unchanged since the loop body is omitted and does not affect the given variables.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `ratings` remains as `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False**
