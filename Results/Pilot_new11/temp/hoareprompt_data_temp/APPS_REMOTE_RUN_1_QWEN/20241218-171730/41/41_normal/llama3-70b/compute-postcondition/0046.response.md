Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, the current value of `i` is `n - 2`, and the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is false for all `j`. Since the if condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is false for all `j`, this condition does not change any variables and remains as stated in the precondition.***
