Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `unrated` is `True`, `rated` is `False`, and `maybe` is `True`.
- The loop runs through each index `j` from `i+1` to `n-1` (inclusive) in the `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` lists.
- If the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is met for any pair of indices `(i, j)`, the loop breaks and `unrated` becomes `False`.
- If the loop completes without breaking, meaning no such pair is found, `unrated` remains `True`.
- Once the loop finishes, `i` will be set to `n`, and since `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` will also become `False`.

Since the loop will either find a pair satisfying the condition or run through all elements without finding such a pair, the final state will be:
- `unrated` is `False` (if any pair is found)
- `rated` remains `False` (as the condition does not affect this variable directly)
- `maybe` is `False` (since `unrated` becomes `False`)
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers
- `n` remains the same (a non-negative integer greater than 0)
- `i` is set to `n` after the loop completes
