The code sets the variable `is_rated` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `ratings`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, representing the number of lines to be read; each line contains two space-separated integers `a_i` and `b_i` such that 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False**
