The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n` but does not affect the initial state of the list of tuples. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `n` and keep the list of tuples unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the rating of a participant before and after the round, respectively. The list contains exactly n tuples, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each integer in the tuples is between 1 and 4126 inclusive; `n` is the integer input read from the input.**
