Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True. If `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, no change is made to the conditions.* ***

This postcondition reflects that if the condition `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` is met, the condition remains unchanged from the precondition. Since there is no modification or additional condition in the else part, the postcondition simply reiterates the original conditions without alteration.
