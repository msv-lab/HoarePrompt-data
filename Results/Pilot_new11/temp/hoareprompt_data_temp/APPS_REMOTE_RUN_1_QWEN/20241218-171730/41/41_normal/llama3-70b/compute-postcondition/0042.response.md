Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, the current value of `i` is `n - 1`, and the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is false for all `j`, since the if statement does not execute due to the absence of an else clause and the given conditions.***
