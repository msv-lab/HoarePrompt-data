The code `is_unrated = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `is_unrated`. This does not affect the value of `n`, `ratings`, or `is_rated`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `is_unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, representing the number of lines to be read; each line contains two space-separated integers `a_i` and `b_i` such that 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False**
