The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only causes an exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `i` is `n`.**
