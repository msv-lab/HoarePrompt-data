The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The previous values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
