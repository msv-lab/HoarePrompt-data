The code initializes the variable `rated` to `False`. This does not affect the lists `ratings_before` or `ratings_after` or the value of `n`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `rated`.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `rated` is `False`**
