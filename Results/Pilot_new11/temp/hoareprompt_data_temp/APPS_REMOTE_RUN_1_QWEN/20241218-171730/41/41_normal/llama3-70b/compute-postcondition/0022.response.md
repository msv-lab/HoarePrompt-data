The variable `unrated` is set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`**
