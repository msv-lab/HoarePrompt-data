The code `ratings_after.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. Since `ratings_after` was initially `[b]`, after appending `b`, it becomes `[b, b]`.

The other variables (`ratings_before`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is `['a', a, a]', `ratings_after` is `[b, b]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0**
