State before the loop starts: `n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since `range(1, n)` means `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`).
3. For the loop to execute at all, there must be at least one value of `i` such that `1 <= i < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ratings` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `(a_i, b_i)` where `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`.
- `is_rated` is False.
- `is_unrated` is True.

Since the loop requires `i` to be at least 1 and less than `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final state should be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True**.
