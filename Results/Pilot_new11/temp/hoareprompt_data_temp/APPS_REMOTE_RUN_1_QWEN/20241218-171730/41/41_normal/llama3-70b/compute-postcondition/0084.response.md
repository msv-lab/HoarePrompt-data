The variable `rated` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables (`unrated`, `i`, `j`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` remains unchanged, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` remains unchanged, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged**
