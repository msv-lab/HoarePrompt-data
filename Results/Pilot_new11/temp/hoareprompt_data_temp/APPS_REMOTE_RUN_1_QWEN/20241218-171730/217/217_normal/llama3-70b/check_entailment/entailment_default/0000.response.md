Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible value of \( B - C \), where \( B \) is the sum of elements in sequence \( b \) and \( C \) is the sum of elements in sequence \( c \). The code instead calculates the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices, which is not the same as the maximum possible value of \( B - C \).

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 -2 0
```
The correct output should be 3, as we can partition the sequence into \( b = \{1, 0\} \) and \( c = \{-2\} \), giving \( B = 1 \) and \( C = -2 \), so \( B - C = 3 \).

However, the code will partition the sequence into \( b = \{1\} \) and \( c = \{-2, 0\} \), giving \( B = 1 \) and \( C = -2 \), so the output will be \( B - C = 3 \), which is correct for this specific example but does not guarantee the maximum possible value for all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should consider all possible partitions of the sequence and compute \( B - C \) for each partition to find the maximum value. The current approach does not explore all partitions, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
