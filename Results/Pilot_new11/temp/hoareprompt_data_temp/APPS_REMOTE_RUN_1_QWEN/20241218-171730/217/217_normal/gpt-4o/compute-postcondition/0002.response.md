The code calculates the sum of elements in list `a` that are greater than 0. Since all elements in `a` are greater than 0, the sum will be the sum of all elements in `a`, which is 6. This sum is assigned to the variable `B`. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 2, 3], `B` is 6**
