The code `C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)` iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and includes it in the sum only if `x` is less than 0. Since the elements of `a` are `[1, 2, 3]`, none of them are less than 0, so the sum is 0. Therefore, `C` is assigned the value 0.

The initial states of the other variables (`n` and `B`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 2, 3], `B` is 6, `C` is 0**
