First, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet:

- Initial State: `i` is 2, `c` is `c + 2 * a[1]`, `b` is unchanged.
- Code: `c += a[i]`

From the initial state, we know that `c` is initially set to `c + 2 * a[1]`. However, the exact value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, only its formula. The value of `a[1]` is also not specified.

When the code `c += a[i]` is executed, it increments `c` by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. So, `c` will now be `c + 2 * a[1] + a[2]`.

Let's summarize the changes and the current state of the variables:
- `i` remains unchanged at 2.
- `c` is updated to `c + 2 * a[1] + a[2]`.
- `b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `c` is `c + 2 * a[1] + a[2]`, `b` is unchanged**.
