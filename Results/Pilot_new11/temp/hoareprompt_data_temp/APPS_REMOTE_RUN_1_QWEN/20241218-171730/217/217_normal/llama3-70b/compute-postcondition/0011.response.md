The initial state is that `i` is 1 and `c` is incremented by `a[1]`. The code snippet `b += a[i]` means that `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the same as `a[1]`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `c` is incremented by `a[1]`

After executing `b += a[i]`:
- `i` remains unchanged (still 1)
- `c` remains unchanged (it was incremented by `a[1]` but no further operation is performed on `c`)
- `b` is updated to `b + a[1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 1; `c` is incremented by `a[1]`; `b` is updated to `b + a[1]`**
