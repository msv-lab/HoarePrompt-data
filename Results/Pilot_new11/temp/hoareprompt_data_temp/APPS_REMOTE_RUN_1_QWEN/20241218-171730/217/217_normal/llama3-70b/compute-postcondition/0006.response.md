The code `b += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `b`. Given that `i` is 0 (since the initial condition is `i` modulo 2 is equal to 0) and `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `a[i]` is the first element of the list, which is the largest element.

Since the exact values of `a` are not specified, we can denote the first element of `a` as `a[0]`. The value of `b` is updated to be `b + a[0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is still a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `c` is still 0, `i` is still 0, and `i` modulo 2 is still equal to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is `b + a[0]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 is equal to 0**.
