The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of elements in the sequence `a`. After executing this line, the value of `n` is known, but the sequence `a` is not yet defined because the input for the sequence elements is not read yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of elements in the sequence `a`, and the sequence `a` is not yet defined.**
