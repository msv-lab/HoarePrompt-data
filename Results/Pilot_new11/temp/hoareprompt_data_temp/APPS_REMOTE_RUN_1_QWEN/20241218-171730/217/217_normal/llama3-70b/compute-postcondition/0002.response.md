The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers. After sorting, the elements of `a` will be arranged in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.**
