The code `name, type_ = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not affect its value.

Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute one more time, the output state will include this condition, along with the updated values of `name` and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `name` is the first part of the input; `type_` is the second part of the input**
