Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1 and must have at least one element
- `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0
- `script` is a list containing two elements `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`
- `i` is 2

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the `examples` list using `enumerate`, starting from `i = 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, which means we are currently on the second item in the `examples` list.

### Adjusting States:
- Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
- The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `examples` list to iterate over. Since `examples` must have at least one element, it will continue until all elements are processed.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be 3.
- `file` will be the third element in the `examples` list.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is a list containing two elements `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`, `i` is 3**
