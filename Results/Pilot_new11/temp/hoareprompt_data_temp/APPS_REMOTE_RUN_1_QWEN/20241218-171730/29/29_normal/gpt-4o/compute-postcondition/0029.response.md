`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`. After incrementing, the new value of `temp_counter` will still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` because adding 1 to a number that is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` will not exceed this limit. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`; `temp_counter` is equal to the previous value of `temp_counter` plus 1; `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`; `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`.**
