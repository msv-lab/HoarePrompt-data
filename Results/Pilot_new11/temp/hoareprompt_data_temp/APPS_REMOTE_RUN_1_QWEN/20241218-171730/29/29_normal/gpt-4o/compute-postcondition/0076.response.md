Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `temp_counter` is 2.
   - `0` is in `files_set`.
   - `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `temp_counter` is 2.
   - `0` is in `files_set`.
   - `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.

4. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be satisfied:
     1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     2. `str(temp_counter)` (which is "2") must be in `files_set`

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `temp_counter` is already 2, and we know that `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, so the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) is already met.
   - We need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (which is "2") is still in `files_set` for the next iteration.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that "2" remains in `files_set` for the next iteration. Since "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body, it will remain there unless explicitly removed.

Therefore, no additional state changes are required beyond ensuring that `2 * n` remains greater than or equal to 2 and "2" remains in `files_set`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`temp_counter` is 2, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body**
