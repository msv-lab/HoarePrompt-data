The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of files, and `files`, which is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i", with `name_i` being a filename and `type_i` being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively. After processing the input, the function returns a list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position, stored in the variable `moves`.
