Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where both example and regular tests coexist, and the filenames of example tests are not already sequential from 1 to \(e\). The function `func_1` attempts to reorder the files but fails to ensure that all example tests are placed sequentially from 1 to \(e\) before moving the regular tests. This can result in incorrect reordering if the initial filenames of example tests are not already in the correct sequence.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
2 0
1 1
4 0
3 1
5 0
```

The expected output would be:

```
4
move 1 1
move 2 4
move 3 2
move 5 3
```

However, the provided code might not handle this correctly due to the way it iterates and moves files. Specifically, the code may fail to place the example tests correctly in the initial stages, leading to incorrect reordering of the files.
