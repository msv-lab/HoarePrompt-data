Let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1
- `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element
- `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`
- `i` is `len(examples)`

### Loop Code
```python
for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```

### Analysis
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` starts at `len(examples)`.
   - The loop iterates over the `regular` list, starting from the index `len(examples)`.

2. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - For each `file` in `regular`, starting from the position `len(examples)`, a move command is appended to `script`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will continue until all elements in `regular` have been processed.
   - Since `regular` contains at least one element, the loop will execute at least once.
   - The loop will append a move command for each element in `regular`, starting from the position `len(examples)`.

4. **Variables After the Loop**:
   - `i` will be `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
   - `script` will contain the move commands for all elements in `regular`, each appended starting from the position `len(examples)`.

### Final Output State
- `n` remains the same as it was initially: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `files` remains unchanged: `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple.
- `examples` remains unchanged: `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.
- `regular` remains unchanged: `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element.
- `script` will contain the move commands for all files in `regular`, each appended starting from the position `len(examples)`.
- `i` will be `len(examples) + len(regular)`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `regular` starting from the position `len(examples)`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`**.
