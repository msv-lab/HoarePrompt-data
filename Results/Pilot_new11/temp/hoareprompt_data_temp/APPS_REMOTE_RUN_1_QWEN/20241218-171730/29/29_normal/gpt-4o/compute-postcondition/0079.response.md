The code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list, which includes `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `regulars` or the index `i`, and `temp_counter` remains unchanged. The value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `files_set` still contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, and `moves` now contains a new element 'move regulars[i] temp_counter'.**
