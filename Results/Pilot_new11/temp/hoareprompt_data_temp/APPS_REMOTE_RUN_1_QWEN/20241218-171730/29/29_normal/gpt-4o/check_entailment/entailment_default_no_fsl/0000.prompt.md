You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

        if type_ == '1':

            regulars.append(name)

            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
    return moves


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `files`, where each element in `files` is a string representing a file with the format "name_i type_i". It returns a list of move commands required to place each file in its correct position. Specifically, files with type "1" (example tests) are placed in positions 1 through `n`, and files with type "0" (regular tests) are placed in positions `n+1` through `2*n`. The function ensures that each file's name matches its position index after reordering, using temporary move commands to achieve this. If a file's name does not match its intended position, the function uses the smallest available index to temporarily place the file and then moves it to its correct position. Potential edge cases include when a file's name is already in the correct position, or when no such position exists, requiring the use of a temporary index. The function handles these cases by ensuring every file ends up in its correct position with the minimum number of move commands.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
