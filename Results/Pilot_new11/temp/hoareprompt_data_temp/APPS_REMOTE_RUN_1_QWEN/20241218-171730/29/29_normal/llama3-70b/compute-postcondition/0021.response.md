The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a new string to the list `script`. This new string includes the value of `file` and the value of `i`, which is 3.

- The value of `file` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, so it remains as part of the string being appended.
- The value of `i` is 3.

Therefore, the list `script` will include its original two elements plus the newly appended string `"move {file} 3"`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is a list containing three elements `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2', 'move {file} 3']`, `i` is 3**
