The code appends a tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. Given the initial state, `n` is \(n - 1\), `name` is the first part of the input split by space, and `type_` is the second part of the input split by space. After executing the line of code, the list `files` will contain the newly appended tuple, while `n`, `name`, and `type_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is \(n - 1\), `name` is the first part of the input split by space, `type_` is the second part of the input split by space, `files` is `[('name', int(type_))]`**
