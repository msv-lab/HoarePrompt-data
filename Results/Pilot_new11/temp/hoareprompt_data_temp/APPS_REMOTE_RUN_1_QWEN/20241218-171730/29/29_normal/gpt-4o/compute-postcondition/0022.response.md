To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the initial states step by step.

### Given Code:
```python
for i in range(len(examples)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
- `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i".
- `examples` is a list of names of files that contain example tests.
- `regulars` is a list of names of files that contain regular tests.
- `moves` is an empty list.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(examples) - 1`. For the loop to execute even once, `len(examples)` must be at least 1. Therefore, `i` should start from 0, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `temp_counter`, `files`, `regulars`, and `moves` do not directly affect the execution of the loop based on the given information. The loop only depends on the length of the `examples` list.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `len(examples)` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.

### Final Answer:
State: **`len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
