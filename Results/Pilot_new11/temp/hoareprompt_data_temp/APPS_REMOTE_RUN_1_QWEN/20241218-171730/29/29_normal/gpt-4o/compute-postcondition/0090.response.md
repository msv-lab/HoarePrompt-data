Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `regulars` has at least one element.
  - `i` is `(initial i) + 1`.
  - `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`.
  - `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 2` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`.

The loop will continue as long as both conditions in the `while` statement are true:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that both conditions hold true at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is at least `initial i + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must still satisfy `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Therefore, `temp_counter` should be adjusted such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - Currently, the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.
   - Therefore, the string representation of `temp_counter` must still exist in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is already at least `initial i + 2` and its string representation exists in `files_set`, we only need to ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n` for the next iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

### Final State:
- `regulars` has at least one element.
- `i` is `(initial i) + 1`.
- `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`.

State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`**
