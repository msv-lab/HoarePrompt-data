Postcondition: ***`regulars` has at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` remains unchanged, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, and `moves` contains a new element `'move regulars[i] temp_counter'`. If `regulars[i]` equals `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` remains unchanged and `moves` does not change.***
