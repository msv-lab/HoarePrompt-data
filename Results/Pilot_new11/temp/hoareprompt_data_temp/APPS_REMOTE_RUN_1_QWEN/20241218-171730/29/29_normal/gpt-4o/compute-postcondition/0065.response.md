Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is either "3" or "4". If `examples[i]` is "4", then `temp_counter` is 5, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 5'`, `'move 2 2'`, and `'move 2 {2 * n + 2}'`. If `examples[i]` is "3", the original conditions are maintained: `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, which is "3"***
