`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to 2, so after incrementing, it will be 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`**
