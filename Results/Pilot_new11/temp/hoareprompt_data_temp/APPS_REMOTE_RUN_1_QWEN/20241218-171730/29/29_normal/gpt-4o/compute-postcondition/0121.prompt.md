You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of files, and files is a list of strings, where each string represents a file and has the format "name_i type_i", with name_i being a filename and type_i being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i", `examples` is a list of names of files that contain example tests, and `regulars` is a list of names of files that contain regular tests.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `examples` is a list of strings where `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all valid indices.
    #- `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + 1` (or the highest index used during the loop).
    #- `files_set` contains the names of all files that are present in the `files` list.
    #- `moves` is a list of strings indicating all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `regulars` is a list of strings where each element is either in its correct position (i.e., equal to `str(len(examples) + i + 1)` for some `i` in the range of the list length) or has been moved to its correct position, `target` is the correct position for the last unplaced element in `regulars`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1` if no elements were moved, otherwise it is the next available position after placing the last element, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, and `moves` is a list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position.
    return moves
    #The program returns the list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position, stored in the variable `moves`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `files`, and returns a list of move commands to place each file in its correct position.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position, stored in the variable `moves`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
