The code `regulars = []` creates an empty list named `regulars`. This does not modify the existing values of `n` or `files`, but initializes `regulars` as an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `regulars` and retains the initial states of `n` and `files`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file and has the format "name_i type_i", with `name_i` being a filename and `type_i` being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively; `examples` is an empty list; `regulars` is an empty list**
