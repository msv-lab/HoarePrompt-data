According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `files` list. The loop condition depends on the presence of elements in `files`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least one element, `name` is part of the split string from `file`, and `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least two elements, because the first element was already processed in the previous iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `files` must have at least one element.
   - `name` is part of the split string from `file`.
   - `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file`.

2. **After the First Iteration**:
   - `files` now has at least one less element (since the first element was processed).
   - `examples` or `regulars` might have been modified based on the `type_` of the first `file`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `files` must still have at least one element (i.e., `files` must have at least two elements after the first iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least two elements, `name` is part of the split string from `file`, `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file`.**
