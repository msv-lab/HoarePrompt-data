Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `regulars` has at least one element.
- `i` is `(initial i) + 1`.
- `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation must exist in `files_set`.
- `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`.
- We need to ensure that `temp_counter + 1` satisfies both conditions in the `while` loop.

1. **First Condition: `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n`**
   - For the loop to continue, `temp_counter + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Second Condition: `str(temp_counter + 1) in files_set`**
   - For the loop to continue, the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` must exist in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is already `temp_counter + 1` at the start of this iteration, we need to ensure these two conditions hold true for `temp_counter + 1`.

Given that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation exists in `files_set`, we only need to adjust the `temp_counter` to reflect the incremented value and ensure the new value still meets the conditions.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `temp_counter` must be `temp_counter + 1`.
- Ensure that `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` exists in `files_set`.

Final state:
**`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and must satisfy `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1) in files_set`**.
