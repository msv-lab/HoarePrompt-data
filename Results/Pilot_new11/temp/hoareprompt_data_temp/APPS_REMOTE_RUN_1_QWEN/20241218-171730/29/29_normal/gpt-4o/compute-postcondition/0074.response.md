Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `temp_counter` is 1
   - `0` is in `files_set`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions within the `and` operator need to be true.
   - The first condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - The second condition is `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

4. **First Condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`)**:
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is 1.
   - For this condition to remain true, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 1. This means `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Second Condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`)**:
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is 1, so `str(temp_counter)` is "1".
   - Since "1" is already in `files_set`, this condition is satisfied for the current value of `temp_counter`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `temp_counter` will be incremented to 2.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `2 * n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 (since `temp_counter` will be 2), and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.

7. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Ensure `2 * n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - Ensure "2" is added to `files_set` in the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs to be modified as follows:

State: **`temp_counter` is 1, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body**
