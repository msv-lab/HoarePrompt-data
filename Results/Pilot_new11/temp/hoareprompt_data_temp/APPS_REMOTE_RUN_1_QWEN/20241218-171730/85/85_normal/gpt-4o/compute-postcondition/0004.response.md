`n` is divided by 10 using integer division (`//=`), which means `n` loses its last digit. Given that `n` ends in 9, after this operation, the last digit of `n` will no longer be 9. However, the problem does not specify what the exact new value of `n` is, only that it has lost its last digit. The condition that `n` is between 2 and \(10^9\) remains valid. The value of `max_9s` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and \(10^9\) and does not end in 9; `max_9s` is 1**
