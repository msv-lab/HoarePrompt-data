The code simply prints the value of `pairs`. Since the code does not change the values of `n`, `max_9s`, or `pairs`, only prints it, the values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer obtained by successively removing the last digit of the original `n` until the last digit is not 9, `max_9s` is the count of how many times the last digit was 9 before it stopped being 9, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`, and `pairs` is printed.**
