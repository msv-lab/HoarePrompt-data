The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic that is not specified here. However, given the constraints, it implies that the function might perform some operation or calculation involving the integer `n` within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on an internal logic involving an integer `n` within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
