Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the condition where the sum of the costs of the shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The program checks if the sum of each pair `(i, n - i)` is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the length of the string representation of the sum minus one, which is an incorrect approach.

For example, consider the input `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair to maximize the number of trailing nines in the sum is `(49, 50)` with a sum of `99`. However, the program will not correctly identify this pair because it uses a different method to check divisibility. 

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:
- For `n = 50`, the program would iterate through all possible pairs `(i, 50 - i)` and check the divisibility condition.
- It will incorrectly count pairs like `(1, 49)`, `(2, 48)`, etc., instead of focusing on the specific pair `(49, 50)`.

A correct solution would involve finding the largest possible number of trailing nines in the sum and then counting all valid pairs that achieve this.
