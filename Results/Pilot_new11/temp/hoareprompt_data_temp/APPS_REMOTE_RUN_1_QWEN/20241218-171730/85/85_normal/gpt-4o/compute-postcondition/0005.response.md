Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `n` is between 2 and \(10^9\) and does not end in 9; `max_9s` is 1.
- The `while` loop condition is: `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as \((n + 1) \% 10 == 0\).
   - This means that \(n + 1\) must be a multiple of 10.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is between 2 and \(10^9\).
   - `n` does not end in 9.
   - `max_9s` is 1.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, \(n + 1\) must be a multiple of 10.
   - Therefore, \(n\) must be 9 modulo 10 (i.e., \(n \equiv 9 \pmod{10}\)).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since \(n\) must be 9 modulo 10 for the loop to continue, we need to adjust `n` to be such that \(n + 1\) is a multiple of 10.
   - If `n` ends in 8, then adding 1 would make it a multiple of 10.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - To satisfy the condition \((n + 1) \% 10 == 0\), `n` must be 8 modulo 10.
   - Thus, `n` must end in 8.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must end in 8 and `max_9s` is 1**.
