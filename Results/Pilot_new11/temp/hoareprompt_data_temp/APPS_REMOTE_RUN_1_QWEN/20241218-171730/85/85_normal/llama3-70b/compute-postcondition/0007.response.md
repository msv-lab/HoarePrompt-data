`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is unknown, but since it must be incremented by 1, we know it is now `ans + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans + 1`**
