Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The program attempts to determine the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs, but it does not properly identify the pairs that achieve this.

For example, consider `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair to choose would be shovels 49 and 50, as their total cost is 99, which ends with two nines. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of pairs as 1 instead of identifying the specific pair (49, 50).

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to identify the range of shovels that can form the desired sum. Specifically, for a given `n`, the program should find the largest `a` and `b` such that `a + b` has the maximum number of trailing nines. This requires a different approach than simply counting the number of nines in the range of shovel costs.
