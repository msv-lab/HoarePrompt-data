Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `n + k`. Specifically, the program only checks if `t` is within the range `[1, k]` and `[k+1, n]`, but it does not account for the range `[n+1, n+k]`.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 5 12
```

According to the problem description:
- At `t = 12`, the `(12 - 5) = 7`-th spectator should sit down, and the number of standing spectators should be `5 - 1 = 4`.
- However, the program prints `3`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `t > n` by calculating the correct number of standing spectators based on the remaining spectators after the initial `n` spectators cycle through standing and sitting.
