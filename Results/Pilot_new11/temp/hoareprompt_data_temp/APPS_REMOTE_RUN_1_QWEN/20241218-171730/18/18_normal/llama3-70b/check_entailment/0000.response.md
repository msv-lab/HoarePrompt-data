Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of standing spectators at time `t`. Let's consider the example given:

- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the expected output is `3`.

According to the description, at `t = 12`:
- Spectators `10`, `9`, and `8` are standing.
- Spectators `1` through `7` are sitting.

However, the program calculates:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

For `t = 12`:
- Since `t > n`, it falls into the second condition: `k - (t - n) % k`.
- `(t - n) % k` becomes `(12 - 10) % 5 = 2 % 5 = 2`.
- Therefore, `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - 2 = 3`.

This calculation seems to match the expected output in this specific case. However, let's consider another example to ensure the program works for all cases.

Consider `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 14`:
- According to the description, at `t = 14`:
  - Spectator `10` is standing.
  - Spectators `1` through `9` are sitting.

The program calculates:
- Since `t > n`, it again falls into the second condition: `k - (t - n) % k`.
- `(t - n) % k` becomes `(14 - 10) % 5 = 4 % 5 = 4`.
- Therefore, `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - 4 = 1`.

This result is incorrect because the expected output should be `1`, but the program outputs `1`.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and hence the correctness is **False**.
