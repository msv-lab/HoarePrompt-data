Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from standard input using `map(int, input().split())`, which aligns with the problem's requirement for valid integer inputs within specified ranges.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - For `t` values up to `n` (i.e., `t <= n`), the program prints `min(t, k)`. This correctly reflects the behavior where spectators stand sequentially up to `k` and then stop, and any `t` in this range will be less than or equal to `k` because `k` is the maximum standing time before spectators start sitting.
   - For `t` values greater than `n` (i.e., `t > n`), the program prints `k - (t - n) % k`. This part accurately models the cyclic behavior where spectators continue to stand and sit after `n`. The expression `(t - n) % k` gives the position of the standing spectators relative to the start of the cycle, and `k - (t - n) % k` calculates how many spectators are standing, considering the cycle length `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `t` is exactly `n`, the expression `k - (n - n) % k` simplifies to `k`, which correctly indicates that all `k` spectators are standing.
   - When `(t - n) % k` is zero, the expression `k - 0` also simplifies to `k`, which correctly reflects that the standing spectators complete a full cycle and start sitting again, leaving no standing spectators.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all possible values of `t` within the specified range, thus making the program correct.
