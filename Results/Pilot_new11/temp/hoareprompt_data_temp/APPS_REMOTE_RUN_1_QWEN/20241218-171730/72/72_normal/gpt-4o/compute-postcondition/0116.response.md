Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. `max_questions` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. `row` is updated to `row_initial - 2` if `direction == 1` and `row == n`, or to `row_initial - 2` if `row` was initially not -1 and `direction == 1`. `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`). If `row` equals -1, no changes occur to the variables' values. If `direction == 1` and `row == n`, `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `direction` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all possible outcomes of the if and else parts.
