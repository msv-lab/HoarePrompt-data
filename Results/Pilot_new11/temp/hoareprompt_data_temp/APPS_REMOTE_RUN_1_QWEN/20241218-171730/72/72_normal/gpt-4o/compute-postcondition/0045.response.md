The code `direction = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `direction`. This changes the value of `direction` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is the previous value of `row` plus `direction`, `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`, `x` remains unchanged, and `direction` is `-1`.**
