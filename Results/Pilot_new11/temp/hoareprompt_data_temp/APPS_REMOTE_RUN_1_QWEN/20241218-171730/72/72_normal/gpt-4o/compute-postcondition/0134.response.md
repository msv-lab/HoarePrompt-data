The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`col`, `m`, `row`, `x`, `y`, `max_questions`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row` is -1, `col` is not equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `direction` is 1.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row` is -1, `col` is not equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `direction` is 1**
