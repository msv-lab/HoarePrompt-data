`x` is decremented by 1. The original value of `x` was an integer between 1 and `n`. After decrementing by 1, `x` will now be an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`.**
