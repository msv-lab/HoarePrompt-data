The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `direction`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is one less than its original value, `row` is `row_initial - 2`, `row` is equal to `row + 3` (only if `row != -1`), and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`); `direction` is 1.**
