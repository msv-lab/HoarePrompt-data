Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 plus 1. If `row == n`, then `row` is updated to `(row - 1) - 2`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`), and `direction` is -1. If `row != n`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
