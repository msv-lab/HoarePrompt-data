Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is equal to `row + 3` (only if `row != -1`), `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` is equal to `x` (only if `row != -1`), otherwise the value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `row` equals `-1`, no changes occur to the variables' values.***
