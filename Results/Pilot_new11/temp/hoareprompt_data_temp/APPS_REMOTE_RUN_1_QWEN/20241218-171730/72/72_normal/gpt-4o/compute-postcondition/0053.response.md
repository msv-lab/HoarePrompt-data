Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. Depending on the condition `direction == 1`, `max_questions` either increases by 1 or decreases by 1. The value of `row` changes according to the following rules: if `direction == 1`, it is either `prev_row - 3` (if `row == n`), or the previous value of `row` plus `direction` (otherwise). If `direction != 1`, `row` is the previous value of `row` plus 1 (unless `row == -1`, in which case it becomes the previous value of `row` plus 1 plus 2). `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`. `x` and `direction` remain unchanged.***
