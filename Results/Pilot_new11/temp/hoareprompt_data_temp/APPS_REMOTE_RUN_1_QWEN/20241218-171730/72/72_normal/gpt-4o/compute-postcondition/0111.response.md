The code `max_questions -= 1` decrements the value of `max_questions` by 1. Since `max_questions` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1, and now it is being decreased by 1, the value of `max_questions` will now be whatever its current value was before minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is one less than its original value, `row` is either `row_initial - 3` or `row_initial + direction` (only if `direction == 1`), `row` is equal to `row + 3` (only if `row != -1`), and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`). If `row` equals `-1`, no changes occur to the variables' values.**
