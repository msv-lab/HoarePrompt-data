The code assigns the value of `full_cycles` to `min_questions`. The value of `full_cycles` is already defined as `k // (2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `k // m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`; `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`; `full_cycles` is `k // (2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `k // m`; `min_questions` is `full_cycles`**
