The code assigns the value of `min_questions` to `sergei_questions`. Since the value of `min_questions` is defined as \(\frac{\text{full_cycles}}{2 * n - 2}\) when `n > 1`, and it is 0 otherwise, we need to consider these conditions. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's summarize:

- `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycles`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged.
- `min_questions` remains unchanged unless `n` is 1, in which case it is 0.
- `sergei_questions` is assigned the value of `min_questions`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m\), and `max_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\). If `n > 1`, `min_questions` is \(\frac{\text{full_cycles}}{2 * n - 2}\); otherwise, `min_questions` is 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`.**
