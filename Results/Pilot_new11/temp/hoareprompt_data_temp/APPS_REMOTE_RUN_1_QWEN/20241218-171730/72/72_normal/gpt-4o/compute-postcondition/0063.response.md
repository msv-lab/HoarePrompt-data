`row` is incremented by `direction`. If `row` was initially equal to `x` and `col` was initially equal to `y`, then the increments specified in the initial state will not apply because the condition `row == x and col == y` is not met (as per the code execution logic). Therefore, the values of `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `col` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `col` is incremented by 1.**
