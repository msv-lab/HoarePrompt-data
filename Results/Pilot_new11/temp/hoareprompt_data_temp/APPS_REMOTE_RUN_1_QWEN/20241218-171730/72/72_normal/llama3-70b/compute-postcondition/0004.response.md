The code prints the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. Since the actual values of these variables depend on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, the printed values will be based on the formulas given:

- `max_asked` is calculated as \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\)
- `min_asked` is calculated as \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))\)
- `sergei_asked` is either \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n)\) or \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + 1\)

However, since no specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are provided, the values of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` remain as expressions dependent on these variables.

No variables are modified by the print statements, so their states remain as they were before the print statements were executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `max_asked` is \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\), `min_asked` is \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1)), `sergei_asked` is either \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n)\) or \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + 1\)**
