`max_questions` is incremented by 1. The values of `m`, `sergei_questions`, `row`, `col`, and `direction` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` has been incremented by 1, `row == x`, `col == y`, `direction == 1`, and `max_questions` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` has been incremented by 1, `row == x`, `col == y`, `direction == 1`, and `max_questions` has been incremented by 1.**
