`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `col` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. The condition `row == x` and `col == y` does not affect the value of `sergei_questions` because it is not met (as per the initial state). Therefore, the Output State is: `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `col` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`max_questions` is decreased by 1, `col` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
