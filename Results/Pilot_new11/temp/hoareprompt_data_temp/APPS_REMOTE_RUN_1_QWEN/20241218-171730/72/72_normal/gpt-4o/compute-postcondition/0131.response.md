`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row` is not equal to `x`, `col` is not equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row` is not equal to `x`, `col` is not equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`.**
