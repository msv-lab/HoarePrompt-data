Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m\), and `max_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\). If `n > 1`, `min_questions` is \(\frac{\text{full_cycles}}{2 * n - 2}\); otherwise, `min_questions` is 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`. `x` is neither 0 nor `n-1`**
