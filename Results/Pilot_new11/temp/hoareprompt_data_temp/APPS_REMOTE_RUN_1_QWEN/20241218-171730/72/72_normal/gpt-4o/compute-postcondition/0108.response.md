The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the `remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `max_questions`, `row`, `sergei_questions`, and `direction` are all unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 plus 1, `row` is updated to `row + direction` (if `row != -1`), `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`), `direction` is -1.**
