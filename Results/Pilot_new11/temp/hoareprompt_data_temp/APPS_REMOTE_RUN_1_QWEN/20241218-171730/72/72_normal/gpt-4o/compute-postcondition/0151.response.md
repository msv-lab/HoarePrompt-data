Postcondition: **`col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are integers. If `direction == 1`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by the value of `direction`. If `row == n`, then `row` is set to -2 and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, and `row` is either 4 or `1 + direction`, depending on whether `row` equals -1 or not.**
