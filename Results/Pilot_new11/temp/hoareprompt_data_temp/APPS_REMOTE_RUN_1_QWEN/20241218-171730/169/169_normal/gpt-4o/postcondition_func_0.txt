The function `func()` accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "-" and "+". It then iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each '+', it increments the counter `stones` by 1. For each '-', it decrements `stones` by 1. After processing all characters in `s`, it prints the final value of `stones`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations, such as invalid input types or lengths outside the specified range. However, since the function reads inputs directly from the user, it implicitly relies on valid input.
