The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func()`. The functionality of the function is to process a string `s` of length `n` where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` consists only of '-' and '+' characters. However, since no specific operation or return value is provided in the output, we can only describe the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
