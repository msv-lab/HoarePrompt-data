`minus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('-')`, which counts the number of hyphens ('-') in the string `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code only affects `minus_count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string entered by the user; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`.**
