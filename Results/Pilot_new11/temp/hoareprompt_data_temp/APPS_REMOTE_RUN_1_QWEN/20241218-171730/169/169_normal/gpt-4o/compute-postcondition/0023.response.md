The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the problem description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition does not include any parameters but the constraints mention `$n` and `$s`. Given the constraints and the expected output cases, we can infer that the function should accept two parameters: `$n` and `$s`.

If we strictly follow the provided format and structure:

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `$n` and `$s`. `$n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `$s` is a string of length `$n$` consisting only of "-" and "+". The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given output cases, so we assume it might return some value based on the internal logic.

Given the lack of explicit return statement in the output cases, we focus on the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `$n$` and `$s$. `$n$` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `$s$` is a string of length `$n$` consisting only of "-" and "+`.**
