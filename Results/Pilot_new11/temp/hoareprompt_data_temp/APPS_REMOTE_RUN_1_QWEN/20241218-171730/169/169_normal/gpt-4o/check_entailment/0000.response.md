Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. It initializes `stones` to 0 and iterates through the operations, decrementing only when a '-' is encountered, ensuring the pile never becomes empty. The logic handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example:
- If the input is `3 ---`, the output is `0`, which is correct.
- If the input is `4 ++++`, the output is `4`, which is correct.
- If the input is `2 -+`, the output is `1`, which is correct.
- If the input is `5 ++-++`, the output is `3`, which is correct.

Since the program works correctly for all tested examples and potential cases, it is correct.
