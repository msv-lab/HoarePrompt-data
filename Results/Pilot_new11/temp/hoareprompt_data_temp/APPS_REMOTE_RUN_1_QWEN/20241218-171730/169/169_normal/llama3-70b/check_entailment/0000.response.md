Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the initial number of stones is greater than the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations and prints `0` in that case. However, the correct approach should ensure that the final number of stones is at least `1`, regardless of the initial number of stones, as long as there are more '+' operations than '-' operations.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
5
+-+

Output:
0
```

In this case, the program will output `0`, but the correct output should be `1` because even if Vasya starts with `0` stones, the net effect of the operations results in `1` stone in the pile. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
