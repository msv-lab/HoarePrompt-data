According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `operation`. The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `operation` is the next character in the string `s`.

The loop will continue to execute if `operation` is a valid character in the string `s`. If the loop needs to execute one more time, it means there must be another character in the string `s` following the current `operation`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `operation` is the current character in `s`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `s` following the current `operation`.
3. Therefore, the new `operation` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Given these points, we can adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `operation` is the next character in the string `s` (which is the character following the previous `operation`).**

In other words, the next `operation` will be the character right after the current one.

So the final state is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `operation` is the next character in the string `s`.**
