Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of operations \( n \) as an integer.
   - It then reads a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of "-" and "+" characters, which represents the sequence of operations performed by Vasya.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - A variable `stones` is initialized to 0, representing the initial number of stones in the pile.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string \( s \).
   - For each character:
     - If the character is "+", the number of stones is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is "-", the number of stones is decremented by 1, but the value is clamped to be at least 0 to ensure the pile never becomes empty during operations.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all operations, the program prints the final number of stones in the pile, which is the minimal possible number of stones after performing the given sequence of operations.

The program adheres to the following key aspects of the problem description:
- It handles the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- It processes the string \( s \) to simulate the sequence of operations correctly.
- It ensures that the pile remains non-empty before any subtraction operation by clamping the value of `stones` to 0.
- It calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement without any contradictions or omissions, it is considered correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
