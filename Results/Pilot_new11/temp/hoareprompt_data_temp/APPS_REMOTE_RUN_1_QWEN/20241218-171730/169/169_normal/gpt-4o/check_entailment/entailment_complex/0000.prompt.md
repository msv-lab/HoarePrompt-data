You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.

++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ is a positive integer such that $1 \leq n \leq 100$, and $s$ is a string of length $n$ consisting only of "-" and "+".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, and for every `operation` in `s`, if `operation` is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1. If `operation` is '-', `stones` is decremented by `n`. Otherwise, the value of `stones` remains unchanged.
    print(stones)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "-" and "+". It then iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each '+', it increments the counter `stones` by 1. For each '-', it decrements `stones` by 1. After processing all characters in `s`, it prints the final value of `stones`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations, such as invalid input types or lengths outside the specified range. However, since the function reads inputs directly from the user, it implicitly relies on valid input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
