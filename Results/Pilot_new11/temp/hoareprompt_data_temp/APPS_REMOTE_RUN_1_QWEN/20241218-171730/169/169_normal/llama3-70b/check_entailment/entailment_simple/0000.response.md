Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of operations `n` as an integer.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` containing only '-' and '+' characters.

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters (`minus_count`) and the number of '+' characters (`plus_count`) in the string `s`.

3. **Logic Implementation**:
   - If the number of '-' characters (`minus_count`) is greater than the number of '+' characters (`plus_count`), the program prints `0`. This is because, starting with a non-negative number of stones, if the number of removals exceeds the number of additions, the pile can become empty (0 stones).
   - Otherwise, the program prints `plus_count - minus_count`. This represents the minimum possible number of stones remaining in the pile after performing all the operations. 

4. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the number of stones might need to be 0 (if the number of removals exceeds additions).
   - For any other scenario, the difference between the number of additions and removals directly gives the minimum possible number of stones remaining.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It calculates the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after performing the given operations, considering both the addition and removal operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
