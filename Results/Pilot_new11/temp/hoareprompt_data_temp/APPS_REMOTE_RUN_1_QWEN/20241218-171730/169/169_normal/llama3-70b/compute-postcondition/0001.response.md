`s` is assigned the value of the string input by the user. The length of this string is `n`, but the exact content of `s` is now determined by the user's input, and `n` remains the same as the length of the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
