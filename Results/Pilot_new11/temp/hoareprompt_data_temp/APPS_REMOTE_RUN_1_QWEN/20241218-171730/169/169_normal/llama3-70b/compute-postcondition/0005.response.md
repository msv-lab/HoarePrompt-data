The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer 0 to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`, `plus_count` is the number of plus signs in the string `s`, and the current value of `minus_count` is greater than the value of `plus_count`.**
