Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` remains unchanged, and `pipe_count` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is a vertical bar (`|`). Otherwise, the values of `i`, `start_colon`, `end_colon`, and `pipe_count` remain as they were before the if statement.***
