Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is a boolean value which became `True` if the character at position `i` in `s` was `':'` and `bind` was set to `i`, otherwise `f` remains `False` and `bind` remains `-1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `bind` is `n - 2`. If the condition `f` is `True`, we break out of the nearest loop or conditional block.***
