The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `i`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement is specified in the given code snippet, it only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
