The code `bind = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `bind`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `ind`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `[` in the string `s` (or -1 if there is no `[`), and `bind` is -1.**
