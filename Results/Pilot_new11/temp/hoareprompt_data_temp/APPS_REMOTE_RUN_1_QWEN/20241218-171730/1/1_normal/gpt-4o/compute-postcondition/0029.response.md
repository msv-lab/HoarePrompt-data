The code `break` does not affect the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, and `i`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement was provided, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` is `n - 3`, `i` is `n - 3**, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
