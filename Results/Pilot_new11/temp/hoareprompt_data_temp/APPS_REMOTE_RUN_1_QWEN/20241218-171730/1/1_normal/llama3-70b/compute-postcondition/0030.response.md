The variable `bind` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, or `f`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, and `f` is True; `bind` is `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, and `f` is True; `bind` is `-1`**
