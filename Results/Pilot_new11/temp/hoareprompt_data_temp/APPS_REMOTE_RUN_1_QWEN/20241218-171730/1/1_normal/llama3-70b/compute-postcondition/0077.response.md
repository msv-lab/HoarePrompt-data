Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is `False`, and `bind` is `-1`. If `ind >= bind`, the console displays `-1`. Otherwise, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `f` remains `False`, and `ans` is the number of `'|'` characters found in the substring of `s` from index `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`, which is printed.***
