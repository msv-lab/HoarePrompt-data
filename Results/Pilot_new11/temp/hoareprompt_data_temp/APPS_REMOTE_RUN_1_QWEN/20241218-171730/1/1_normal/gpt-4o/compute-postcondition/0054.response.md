The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since there is no such loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`, `end_colon` is `i` (which is the index of `':'` in the string `s`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
