Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ind` is either `i` or remains `-1`.
   - `f` is `True`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, `ind` (which is `i` in this context) will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `ind` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `f` remains `True` because there is no condition in the loop body that would change its value.

4. **Updated States**:
   - `s` remains the same since the loop does not modify it.
   - `n` remains the same since the loop does not modify it.
   - `ind` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `f` remains `True`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i + 1`, and `f` is True.**
