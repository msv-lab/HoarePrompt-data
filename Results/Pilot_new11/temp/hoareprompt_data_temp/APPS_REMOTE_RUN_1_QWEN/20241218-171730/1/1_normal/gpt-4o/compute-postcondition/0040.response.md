Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is either `-1` or equal to `i` (where `s[i]` is `':'`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `s[i]` is `':'`.***
