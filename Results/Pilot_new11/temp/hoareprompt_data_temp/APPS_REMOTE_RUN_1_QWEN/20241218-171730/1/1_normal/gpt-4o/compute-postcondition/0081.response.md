The code `print(result)` prints the value of `result`. Since `result` is defined as `4 + pipe_count`, printing `result` does not change its value. The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`result` is `4 + pipe_count`, `pipe_count` is its original value, and the value of `result` is printed.**
