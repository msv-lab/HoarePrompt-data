The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 4, so after the increment, `ans` will be 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `f` is `False`, `ans` is 5, and the current value of `i` is equal to `ind` with `s[i]` being equal to `|`.**
