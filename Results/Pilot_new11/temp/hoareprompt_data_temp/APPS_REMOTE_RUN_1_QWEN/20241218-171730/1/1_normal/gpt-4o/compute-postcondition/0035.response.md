`start_colon` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` is the index of the last `]` character in the string `s` or -1 if there is no `]` in the string, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, and `ind` is less than `bind`; `start_colon` is -1.
