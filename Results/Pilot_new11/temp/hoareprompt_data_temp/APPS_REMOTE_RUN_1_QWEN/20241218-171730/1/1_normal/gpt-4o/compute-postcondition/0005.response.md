The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The value of `i` is the index of the first '[' character in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters '[', ']', ':', and '|', `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in the string `s`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
