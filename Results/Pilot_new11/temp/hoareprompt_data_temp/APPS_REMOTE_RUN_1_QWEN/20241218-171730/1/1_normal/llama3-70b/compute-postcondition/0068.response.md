Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `f` remains `False`, and `ans` is set to 5. This occurs when `s[i]` is equal to `|` at the current value of `i`, which is `ind`. No other changes occur in the case of the absence of the else part.***
