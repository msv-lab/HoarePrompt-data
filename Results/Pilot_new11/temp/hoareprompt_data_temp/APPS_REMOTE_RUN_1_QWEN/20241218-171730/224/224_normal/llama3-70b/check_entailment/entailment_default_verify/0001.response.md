Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` incorrectly computes the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for a given \( n \). This flaw propagates to `func_3`, which relies on an incorrect value of \( f_{max}(n) \). Despite the detailed output hints provided for `func_3`, they do not address the fundamental issue with the computation of \( f_{max}(n) \). Therefore, the overall program cannot produce the correct results for the problem at hand.
