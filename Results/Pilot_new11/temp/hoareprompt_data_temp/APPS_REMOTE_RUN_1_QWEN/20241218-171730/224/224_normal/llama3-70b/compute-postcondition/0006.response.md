The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. However, the initial value of `dp[j]` is not specified, and neither is the value of `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`, the initial value of `dp[j]` is the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`, which is not provided. Therefore, we only know that `dp[j]` is updated to the remainder of its value divided by `MOD`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `f_max_n`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `dp[j]` is the remainder of its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]` divided by `MOD`.**
