You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where \(a > 0\) and \(b \geq 0\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 'a' that is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. The function then returns the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` will be 0 after the algorithm has completed. 

The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the gcd without entering the loop. Additionally, it correctly handles the general case where both `a` and `b` are positive, reducing the problem size in each iteration until `b` becomes 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `res` is the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1(res, i)` for every `i` in the range [1, `n` + 1].
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum value obtained by applying func_1(res, i) for every i in the range [1, n + 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and iterates through the range [1, n + 1]. For each integer `i` in this range, it computes `func_1(res, i)` where `res` starts at 0 and is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the result of `func_1(res, i)`. After completing the iteration, the function returns the maximum value obtained during these computations. This means that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the highest value produced by applying `func_1(res, i)` for every `i` in the specified range. Potential edge cases include the minimum allowed value of `n` (2), as well as the maximum allowed value (10^6). If `n` is less than 2, the function should still start with `res = 0` and iterate from 1 up to the given `n`, ensuring that the computation is performed correctly even for the smallest valid input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n as defined in the problem description.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` retains its original value, and for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #dp[f_max_n], which is the cumulative sum of dp[0] to dp[f_max_n] modulo 1000000007
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `f_max_n` (the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n` as defined in the problem description). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, updating each element `dp[j]` to be the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`. After the loop, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The function performs the following actions:
- Initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents a cumulative sum.
- Sets the base case `dp[0]` to 1.
- Iteratively updates the `dp` array such that each element `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Returns the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` which is the cumulative sum of the `dp` array up to `f_max_n` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 2, the loop will only run once, and `dp[j]` will only update for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.
- If `f_max_n` is 0, the initial `dp[0]` value will not change, and `dp[f_max_n]` will remain 1.

There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all relevant actions are covered in the summary.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
