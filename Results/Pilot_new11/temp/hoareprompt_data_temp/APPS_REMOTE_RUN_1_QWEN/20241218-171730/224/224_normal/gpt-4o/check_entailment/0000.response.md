Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program is attempting to compute the factorial of `n-1` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but this does not match the problem description. According to the problem, we need to count the number of permutations \(p\) of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\).

For \(n = 2\), the only permutation is \([1, 2]\) and \([2, 1]\), and \(f(p) = 1\) for both, which matches the output of the program. However, for \(n = 3\), the permutations and their \(f(p)\) values are:

- \([1, 2, 3]\): \(f(p) = 1\)
- \([1, 3, 2]\): \(f(p) = 1\)
- \([2, 1, 3]\): \(f(p) = 2\)
- \([2, 3, 1]\): \(f(p) = 2\)
- \([3, 1, 2]\): \(f(p) = 2\)
- \([3, 2, 1]\): \(f(p) = 2\)

Here, \(f_{max}(3) = 2\), and there are 4 permutations where \(f(p) = 2\), which is correct. However, the program always returns the factorial of \(n-1\) under modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not the correct solution. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for \(n > 2\).

A correct implementation would involve computing \(f(p)\) for each permutation and counting those where \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\).
