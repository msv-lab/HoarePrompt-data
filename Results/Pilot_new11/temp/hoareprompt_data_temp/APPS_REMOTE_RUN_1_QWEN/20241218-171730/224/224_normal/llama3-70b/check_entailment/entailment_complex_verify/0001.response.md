Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` incorrectly computes the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for a given \( n \). Although the annotated version describes the state transitions correctly, it does not address the core issue that `func_2` does not produce the correct \( f_{max}(n) \). The function `func_3` relies on the incorrect value of \( f_{max}(n) \) returned by `func_2`, leading to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the overall program cannot be considered correct.
