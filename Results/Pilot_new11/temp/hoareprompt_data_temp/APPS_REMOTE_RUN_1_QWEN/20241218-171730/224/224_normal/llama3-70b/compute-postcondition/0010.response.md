According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. The loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1 with a step of -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `f_max_n - 2`.
3. Since `j` starts from `f_max_n - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, `f_max_n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is still 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is still at least 2 (unchanged).
- `f_max_n` is still at least 2 (unchanged).
- `j` is now `f_max_n - 2`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
