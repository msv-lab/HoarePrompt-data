Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`, which ranges from `f_max_n` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is given as 2.
   - `n` is given as at least 2.
   - `f_max_n` is given as at least 2.
   - `dp[j]` is defined as the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD` for all `j` from `f_max_n` to 1.

3. **Loop Execution Criteria:**
   - The loop will execute if `f_max_n` is at least 1, because the loop runs in reverse from `f_max_n` to 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, we need to ensure that `f_max_n` is at least 1 for the loop to start.
   - Given that `f_max_n` is at least 2, this condition is already satisfied.
   - We don't need to adjust `i` or `n` since they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

5. **State of `dp[j]`:**
   - The state of `dp[j]` for `j` from `f_max_n` to 1 is given as the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD`.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- Ensure `f_max_n` is at least 1 (which it already is, being at least 2).
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- The state of `dp[j]` for `j` from `f_max_n` to 1 is already provided.

Therefore, the state before the loop should remain as given.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD` for all `j` from `f_max_n` to 1**
