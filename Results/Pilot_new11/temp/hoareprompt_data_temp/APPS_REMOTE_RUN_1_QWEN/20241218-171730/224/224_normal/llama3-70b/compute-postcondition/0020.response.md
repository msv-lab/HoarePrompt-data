The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates `dp[j]` to `dp[j] % MOD`. Based on the initial state, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, while `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value. The code only affects `dp[j]`, updating it to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Since `dp[j]` was previously updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, the current value of `dp[j]` is `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`. After applying the modulo operation, the new value of `dp[j]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.**
