The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `f_max_n` is at least 2
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`

The value of `j` is updated from `f_max_n - 2`. After executing the line of code, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`. Since the exact values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are not provided, we know that `dp[j]` is now the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**
