The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` is incrementing each element `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial state where `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`, and `dp[0]` retains its original value, the new value of `dp[j]` will simply be the previous cumulative sum plus `dp[j - 1]`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. For `j = 1` to `f_max_n`, the value of `dp[j]` is already the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`.
2. Adding `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[j]` will effectively update `dp[j]` to be the cumulative sum up to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

Given this, the initial state of `dp[j]` (for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`) being the cumulative sum means that each `dp[j]` is already in the form of the cumulative sum up to that point. After the addition, each `dp[j]` will still be the cumulative sum up to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state remains that `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, and `dp[0]` retains its original value.

Output State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
