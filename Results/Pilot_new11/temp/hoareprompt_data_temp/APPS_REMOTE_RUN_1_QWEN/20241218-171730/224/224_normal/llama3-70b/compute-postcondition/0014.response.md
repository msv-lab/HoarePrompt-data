According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `f_max_n` is at least 2
- `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD` for all `j` from `f_max_n` to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1, so it becomes 2.
- Since `n` is at least 2, the condition `i <= n` will still be true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` increases to 2
- `n` remains at least 2 (since the condition `i <= n` is still satisfied)
- `f_max_n` remains at least 2
- `dp[j]` remains the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD` for all `j` from `f_max_n` to 1

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[0]` modulo `MOD` for all `j` from `f_max_n` to 1**
