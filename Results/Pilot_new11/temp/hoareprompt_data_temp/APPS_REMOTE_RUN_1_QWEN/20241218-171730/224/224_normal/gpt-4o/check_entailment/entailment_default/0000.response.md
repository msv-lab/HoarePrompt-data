Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \), where \( f(p) \) is defined as the number of distinct GCD values over all prefixes of \( p \).

However, the code simply calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and returns it. This calculation has nothing to do with the problem's requirements. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1` computes the factorial of \( n-1 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on the defined function \( f(p) \).
2. The main logic of the problem, which involves understanding how to maximize \( f(p) \) and then counting the permutations achieving this maximum, is completely missing.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to understand how to construct permutations that achieve the maximum value of \( f(p) \) and then count such permutations. The current implementation does not address this at all. Therefore, the program is incorrect for every potential case.
