Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the given problem. The program attempts to compute the factorial of `n-1` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not related to the problem of counting permutations where \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` computes the factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which does not match the problem description. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
