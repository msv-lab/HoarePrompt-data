Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[0]` retains its original value.
   - `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` is `dp[j] % MOD`.
   - `f_max_n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - Each iteration processes a value of `j` starting from `f_max_n` and decreasing by 1 each time.

4. **State Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`.
   - The condition `f_max_n` must be greater than 1 still holds true because if it was not, the loop would not have started.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop control variable `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `dp[j] % MOD`.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `dp[j] % MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
