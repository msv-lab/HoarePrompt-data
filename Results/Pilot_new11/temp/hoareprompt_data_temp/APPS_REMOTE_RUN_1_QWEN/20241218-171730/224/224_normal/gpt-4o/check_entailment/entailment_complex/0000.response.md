Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not calculate the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires counting the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that the function \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). Here, \( f(p) \) is defined as the number of distinct values among the sequence of GCDs of prefixes of \( p \), and \( f_{max}(n) \) is the maximum value of \( f(p) \) over all permutations of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

2. **Current Implementation**: The provided program simply calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) and returns it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The function `func_1` computes \( (n-1)! \mod (10^9 + 7) \), which is the product of all integers from 2 to \( n-1 \).

3. **Mismatch**: The calculation of \( (n-1)! \mod (10^9 + 7) \) does not relate to counting permutations with \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). The factorial calculation does not consider the GCD values or the distinct count of those values as required by the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Determine \( f_{max}(n) \).
- Count the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

The current implementation does not address these steps and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
