The code updates `max_speed` to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. Since `max_speed` was initially `max(v1, v2)` and `min_speed` was initially `min(v1, v2)`, the new value of `max_speed` will be `max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`.

The states of the other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `min_length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is `max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_speed` is `min(v1, v2)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`**
