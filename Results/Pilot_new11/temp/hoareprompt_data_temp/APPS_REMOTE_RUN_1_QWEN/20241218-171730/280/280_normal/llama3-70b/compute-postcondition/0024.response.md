Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `v_1` and `v_2` (both integers within the range [1, 100]), `t` (an integer within the range [2, 100]), and `d` (an integer within the range [0, 10]). It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds over a period of `t` units of time, where each unit of time `i` (from `t-1` down to 0) adjusts these speeds based on the decrement and increment by `d`. The function then prints the final maximum length traveled over the given time period.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `d` is 0, the maximum and minimum speeds remain unchanged throughout the iterations, and the function will compute the lengths based on the initial speeds without any adjustments.
- If `v_1` equals `v_2`, the maximum and minimum speeds will be equal at all times, simplifying the calculations.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input values for `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, or `d` are outside their specified ranges. Proper validation and error handling should be included to manage such scenarios.
