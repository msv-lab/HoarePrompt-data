According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. The loop runs from `1` to `t-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

The value of `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the last iteration.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros
- `i` is now 2

State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros, `i` is 2**
