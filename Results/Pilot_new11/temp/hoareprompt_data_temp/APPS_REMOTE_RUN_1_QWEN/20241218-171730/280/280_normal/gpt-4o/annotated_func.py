#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` are computed according to the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `t-1`, and `i` is `t`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It constructs a list `speeds` of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the last element is `v2`. Each subsequent element in the list is calculated as the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` or `v2` minus `(t - i - 1) * d`. After constructing the list, the function calculates the total distance traveled by summing the elements in the `speeds` list and prints the result. The function handles the specified ranges for the inputs and ensures that the `speeds` list is correctly populated according to the given conditions. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
