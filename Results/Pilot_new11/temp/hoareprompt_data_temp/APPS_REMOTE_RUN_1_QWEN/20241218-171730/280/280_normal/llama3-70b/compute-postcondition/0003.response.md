The code assigns the minimum of `v1` and `v2` to `min_speed`. The initial state shows that `v1` and `v2` are integers, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, and `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. After executing the code, `min_speed` will hold the smaller of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is max(`v1`, `v2`), `min_speed` is min(`v1`, `v2`)**
