The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The constraints are that `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10. 

Based on the given cases, the function does not directly return a value but instead handles different conditions. However, since the problem statement only provides the constraints and no specific return values or logic, we can infer that the function might return different outputs based on the input parameters, but without further details, we can only describe the accepted parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` under specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`.**
