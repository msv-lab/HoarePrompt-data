The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. The previous values of `v1` and `v2` are overwritten with the new input values. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged. 

Since the exact input values are not specified, the new values of `v1` and `v2` will depend on the user's input, but they must satisfy the constraints: `1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `v2` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.**
