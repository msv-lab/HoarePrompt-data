To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and continue iterating. The loop will iterate from 1 to `t-1`, meaning `i` will take values from 1 up to `t-1`.

Let's break down the necessary states:

1. **`v1` and `v2`**: These are fixed values and don't change during the loop, but they must be defined and within their respective ranges.
2. **`t`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will run from `1` to `t-1`.
3. **`d`**: This variable doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but might be used inside the loop body. However, its value within its valid range (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) ensures that no constraints are violated in terms of its use within the loop.
4. **`speeds`**: This is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros. The list must exist and have these specific elements.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 2 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `t-1`), and `i` should be initialized to 1 (the first value it takes in the loop).

### Adjusted States:
- `v1` and `v2` must be integers within their respective ranges [1, 100].
- `t` must be an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `d` must be an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
- `speeds` must be a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros.
- `i` must be initialized to 1.

### Final State:
State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**.
