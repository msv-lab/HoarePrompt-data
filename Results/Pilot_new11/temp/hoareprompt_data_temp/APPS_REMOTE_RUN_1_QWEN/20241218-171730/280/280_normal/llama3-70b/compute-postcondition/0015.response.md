First, let's determine the initial values of the variables:

- `v1` is an integer input.
- `v2` is an integer input.
- `t` is an integer such that \( t \geq 2 \).
- `d` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq d \leq 10 \).
- `max_speed` is calculated as \(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d\).
- `min_speed` is calculated as \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\).
- `min_length` is calculated as `min_speed * (t + 1)`.
- `max_length` is calculated as `max_length + 2 * max_speed`.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
min_length += min_speed
```

This means `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its current value. So, the new value of `min_length` will be the old value of `min_length` plus `min_speed`.

Let's update the value of `min_length`:

- Initial `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`.
- After the code executes, `min_length` becomes `min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed`.

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ min_length = min_speed \times (t + 2) \]

So, the updated values are:
- `min_length` is now `min_speed * (t + 2)`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(v2 - d, v1) - d\), `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`, `i` is 2.**
