Output State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` are computed according to the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `t-1`, and `i` is `t`.**
