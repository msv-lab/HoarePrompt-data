The code snippet `max_length += max_speed` increments `max_length` by the value of `max_speed`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.
2. `max_speed` remains unchanged.
3. `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`.

Given the initial state and the changes made by the code, the updated `max_length` is now `max_length + max_speed`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\), `min_speed` is \(\min(min_speed + d, max_speed)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `i` is 1**
