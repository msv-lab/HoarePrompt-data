The code sets `max_length` to `max_speed * t`. The values of `max_speed` and `t` are determined by the initial conditions: `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `min_speed` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is max(`v1`, `v2`), `min_speed` is min(`v1`, `v2`), `max_length` is `max_speed * t`**
