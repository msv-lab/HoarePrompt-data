`min_keg_volume` is assigned the value of `volumes[0]`, which is the first element in the list `volumes`. The values of `n`, `s`, `volumes`, and `total_volume` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\); `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\); `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list; `min_keg_volume` is equal to the first element of the `volumes` list.**
