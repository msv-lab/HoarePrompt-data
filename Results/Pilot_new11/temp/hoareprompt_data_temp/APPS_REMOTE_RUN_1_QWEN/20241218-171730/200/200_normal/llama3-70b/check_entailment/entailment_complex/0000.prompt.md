You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers \( n \) and \( s \) where \( 1 \le n \le 10^3 \) and \( 1 \le s \le 10^{12} \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) where \( 1 \le v_i \le 10^9 \).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is not equal to `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `low` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. It first sorts the list `v`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the smallest value `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `low` exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `low`. The function ensures that the inputs `n`, `s`, and `v` satisfy the given constraints: \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), and \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will terminate with an error, though this is not explicitly handled within the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
