The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not indicate which loop this `continue` statement belongs to, nor does it provide enough information to determine the effect on the variables `n` and `remaining_kvass`. Since no operations are performed on these variables within the scope of the provided code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is 0**
