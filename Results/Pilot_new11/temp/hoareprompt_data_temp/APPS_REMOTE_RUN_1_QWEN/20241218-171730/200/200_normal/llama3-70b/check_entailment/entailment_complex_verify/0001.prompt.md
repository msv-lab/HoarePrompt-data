You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the minimum values from each keg (after distributing `s` liters) is less than `s`. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum value `low` such that the sum of the minimum values from each keg is at least `s`, but it does not check if this distribution actually achieves exactly `s` liters. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 5
4 3 5
```

- The program sorts the kegs: `[3, 4, 5]`.
- It then uses binary search to find the minimum value `low` such that the sum of the minimum values from each keg is at least `5`.
- The initial range is `(0, 3)`.
- After the binary search, `low` is calculated to be `3`.

However, if we distribute the liters:
- From the first keg (3 liters), take 3 liters.
- From the second keg (4 liters), take 2 liters.
- From the third keg (5 liters), take 0 liters.

The total is `3 + 2 + 0 = 5` liters, which matches `s`. But the least keg has only 0 liters, which is not the maximum possible amount in the least keg.

The program should ensure that the sum of the minimum values from each keg equals `s` after the distribution. This can be achieved by checking the condition `sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) == s` after the binary search loop.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers \( n \) and \( s \) where \( 1 \le n \le 10^3 \) and \( 1 \le s \le 10^{12} \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) where \( 1 \le v_i \le 10^9 \).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is not equal to `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `low` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. It first sorts the list `v`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the smallest value `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `low` exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `low`. The function ensures that the inputs `n`, `s`, and `v` satisfy the given constraints: \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), and \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will terminate with an error, though this is not explicitly handled within the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
