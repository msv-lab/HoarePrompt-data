The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables, but it indicates that the loop continues without executing any further statements in the current iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged
- `i` is 1

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `n`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only implication is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged, and `i` is 2 (next iteration)**
