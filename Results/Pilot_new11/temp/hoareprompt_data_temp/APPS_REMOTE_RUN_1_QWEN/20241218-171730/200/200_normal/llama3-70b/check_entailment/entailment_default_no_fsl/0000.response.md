Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the binary search implementation does not ensure that the sum of the minimum values from each keg is exactly equal to `s`. Instead, it only checks if the sum is at least `s`, which is insufficient. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3 5
4 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

However, the provided code will output `-1` because the sum of the minimum values (`3 + 3 + 3 = 9`) is greater than `5`, but it does not check if there is a smaller `low` that satisfies the exact sum requirement.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the sum of the minimum values from each keg equals `s` after the binary search. Here is a revised version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # Check if the exact sum s can be achieved
    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) == s:
        print(low)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This revised code ensures that the sum of the minimum values from each keg equals `s` after the binary search, thus providing the correct output for all cases.
