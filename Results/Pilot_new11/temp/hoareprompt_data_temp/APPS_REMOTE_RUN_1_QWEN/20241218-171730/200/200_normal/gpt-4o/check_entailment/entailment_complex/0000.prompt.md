You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and s are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^{12}, and v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in range n.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, `min_keg_volume` is equal to the first element of the `volumes` list, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume`. The loop breaks out of the loop when `remaining_kvass` is 0 or there are no more elements in `volumes` that satisfy the condition `volumes[i] > min_keg_volume`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, `min_keg_volume` is reduced by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\) and `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is reduced by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\) and `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0; the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list `v` of `n` integers. It first sorts the list `v` in ascending order. Then, it checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is less than `s`. If it is, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it initializes `min_keg_volume` to the smallest element in `v` and calculates the remaining kvass needed (`remaining_kvass`). It iterates through the list `v`, adjusting `min_keg_volume` based on the difference between the current element and `min_keg_volume`, until `remaining_kvass` is zero or the loop exits. If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than zero after the loop, it further reduces `min_keg_volume` by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\). Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the sum of `v` is less than `s` by printing `-1`.
- The function correctly sorts the list `v` before processing.
- The function correctly updates `min_keg_volume` during the iteration, ensuring it is always the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `remaining_kvass` is zero before the loop ends due to elements in `v` being larger than `min_keg_volume`. This means the function may incorrectly reduce `min_keg_volume` even when `remaining_kvass` is zero, which should be a terminal condition for the loop.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\).
- `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
- `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.
- `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.
- `min_keg_volume` is the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass after adjustments.
- `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
