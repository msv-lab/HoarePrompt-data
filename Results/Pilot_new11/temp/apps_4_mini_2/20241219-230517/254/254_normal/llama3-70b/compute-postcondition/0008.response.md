The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0.**
