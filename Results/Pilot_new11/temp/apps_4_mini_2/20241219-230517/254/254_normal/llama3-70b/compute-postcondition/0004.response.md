According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, we have `b` equal to `old_a % old_b`. Since `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`, this means that `b` must be a non-zero value that is the remainder of `old_a` when divided by `old_b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to remain non-zero.

Since `b` is already defined as `old_a % old_b`, we do not need to adjust the state of `b` for it to potentially be non-zero in the next iteration, given that `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`. 

Thus, it is confirmed that for the loop to proceed, the existing state does not require any modification. 

State: **`a` is the value of `old_b`, `b` is equal to `old_a % old_b`, and `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`**.
