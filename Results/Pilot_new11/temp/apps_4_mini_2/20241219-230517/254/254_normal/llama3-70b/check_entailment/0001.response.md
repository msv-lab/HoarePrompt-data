Correctness: **False**

The program logic is flawed as it incorrectly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The condition checked should ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the starting times, but the LCM-derived condition does not guarantee this for overlapping intervals.

To illustrate a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the input `6 8 10`. Here, the LCM of `6`, `8`, and `10` is `120`, which means the following garlands would light every `6`, `8`, and `10` seconds respectively.

However, if you observe the lit seconds:
- Garland 1 is lit at `6, 12, 18, 24, 30,...`
- Garland 2 is lit at `8, 16, 24, 32,...`
- Garland 3 is lit at `10, 20, 30,...`

After the engragement of any switch on times, there will be seconds where none of the garlands are lit, namely the seconds between `30` and `36` seconds after all lights have been on. Thus, there exist points in time with no lit garland, violating the requirement.

Therefore, since the program doesn't correctly ensure all intervals are covered, it is deemed incorrect.
