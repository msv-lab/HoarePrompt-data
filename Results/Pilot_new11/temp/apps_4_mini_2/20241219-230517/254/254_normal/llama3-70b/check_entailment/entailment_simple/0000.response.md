The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible for Mishka to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit at every second after a certain starting time. The key points from the problem description include:

1. Each garland has a specific time interval for when it is lit.
2. We need to find three integers \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) such that starting from the maximum of these, at least one garland is lit during every subsequent second.
3. The solution should determine if there exists such an arrangement of the starting times such that no second is left unilluminated.

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Inputs**: It accepts three integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) which represent the time intervals of the garlands.
2. **LCM Calculation**: It calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) using a formula that involves a greatest common divisor (GCD) function (func_1).
3. **Lighting Condition**: The program checks whether the LCM is divisible by each of the time intervals. If it is, then the program outputs "YES," indicating at least one garland will be lit at every second after the maximum starting time. Otherwise, it outputs "NO."

However, the flaw in the logic arises from how it uses the LCM check. The LCM is given by:

\[
\text{lcm} = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)}
\]

The check for divisibility by each \( k_i \) merely ensures that the LCM is a multiple of each \( k_i \), which does not guarantee that every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) will have at least one garland lit. 

For instance, choosing \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
- The program would calculate that \( \text{lcm}(4, 2, 3) = 12 \), which is indeed divisible by all intervals, but there are moments where no garland is lit (like seconds 1 or 5 after the highest switch-on time). This violates the requirement stated in the problem description.

Overall, the conditions to ensure that at least one garland is lit throughout all seconds after a chosen starting time are not met effectively by the program's logic.

Thus, the program does **not** correctly answer the question posed in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
