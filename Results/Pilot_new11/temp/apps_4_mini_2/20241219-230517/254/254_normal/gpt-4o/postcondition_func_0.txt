The function reads three integers, k1, k2, and k3, from user input, which are constrained to be within the range of 1 to 1500. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers. If the GCD of the three integers is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and it directly prints the outcome. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or numbers outside the specified range), which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, it assumes input as space-separated integers without error handling for improper formatting.
