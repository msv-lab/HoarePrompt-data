Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct according to the problem description. The task requires determining whether there exists a sequence of moments (x1, x2, x3) to switch the garlands on such that every second thereafter has at least one garland lit. The condition for this is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three garland intervals (k1, k2, k3) should be 1. This is because if the GCD is greater than 1, there will be intervals of time where none of the garlands are lit.

However, the program incorrectly interprets this scenario. The use of GCD here is misleading since the problem does not inherently require that the GCD of the intervals must be 1 for at least one garland to be lit at every second after the maximum start time. In fact, there can be valid combinations of x1, x2, and x3 such that every second after max(x1, x2, x3) will be lit, even when their GCD is not 1.

As a specific counterexample: for k1 = 4, k2 = 2, k3 = 3, the program would conclude "NO" due to the GCD being 1; however, it is possible to select x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1, making the intervals (1, 3, 5,...) for k1, (2, 4, 6,...) for k2, and (1, 4, 7,...) for k3 ultimately leading to continuous lighting at subsequent seconds.

This shows that the reliance on GCD for the condition is incorrect and does not correctly assess all possible scenarios as described by the problem.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement for all potential cases.
