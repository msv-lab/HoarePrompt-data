Correctness: **False**

The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three integers \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) and prints "YES" if the GCD is 1, and "NO" otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect according to the problem description.

The problem requires that at least one garland should be lit during every second after the maximum value of \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \). The correct condition for ensuring that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum start time would be if the three garland intervals are such that their least common multiple (LCM) covers all integers without leaving any gaps, not just based on the GCD being equal to 1.

For example:
- Input: `2 2 3` → The output is "YES", which is correct. The garlands light up at intervals that cover every second after the starting time.
- Input: `4 2 3` → The output is "NO", which is also correct because there are seconds after the maximum start time where no garland will be lit.

However, the program fails to address certain configurations correctly:
1. Input: `1 2 3` → GCD is 1 and outputs "YES", which is **incorrect**; since all seconds will be covered and there will be no gaps (all numbers are lit).
2. Input: `2 4 6` → GCD is 2, outputs "NO" which is **incorrect** since there will be intervals (like odd-numbered seconds) that are clearly covered.

Overall, the program's use of GCD as a condition to determine if at least one garland is lit every second is inaccurate. As a result, the program does not satisfy the requirement laid out in the problem description for every potential case, leading to its incorrectness.
