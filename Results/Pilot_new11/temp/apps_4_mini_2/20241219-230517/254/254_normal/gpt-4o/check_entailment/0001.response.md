Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine whether it is possible to choose moments to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after some maximum second. The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) to decide this.

However, the GCD approach does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. For example, consider the case where the input is:

```
2 2 4
```

Here the intervals are `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 4`. The GCD of these numbers is `2`, which implies that the program would output `NO`. However, choosing `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, and `x3 = 1` allows the garlands to be lit at the seconds `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...`, thus covering all seconds. Therefore, the expected output should be `YES`.

Another failing case is:

```
1 1 1
```

For this input, the program will compute the GCD as `1` and will print `YES`, which is indeed correct. But the program fails to handle the case mentioned above, indicating that it is incorrect.

Thus, the reliance on GCD leads to incorrect behavior for at least some input cases, demonstrating that the logic is flawed. Hence, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly for all potential inputs.
