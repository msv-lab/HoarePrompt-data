You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to check whether the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to choose moments for switching on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of those moments.

The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) for the three garland time intervals. The condition it checks is whether the GCD of the three time intervals is equal to 1. However, this checks only if the intervals share a common factor, and it does not properly account for the required logic that it is possible to have overlapping lit times starting from some chosen moments.

### Test Cases:
1. **Example Input**: `2 2 3` 
   - GCD(2, 2, 3) = 1 -> Correctly outputs "YES".
  
2. **Example Input**: `4 2 3` 
   - GCD(4, 2, 3) = 1 -> Correctly outputs "NO".
   
However, the reasoning based on the GCD is flawed. For instance, let's consider the time intervals `4, 6, 8`. Their GCD is actually 2. However, one could select (4, 4, 2) for x values:
- Garland 1 will be lit during: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
- Garland 2 will be lit during: 2, 8, 14...
- Garland 3 will be lit during: 1, 9, 17...

This implies there could be moments when no garland is lit at certain seconds after they start. Therefore, the program doesn't handle the possibility of certain combinations where gaps exist, meaning there's a case where the output would be incorrect.

Thus, we find that the program might output "NO" inaccurately due to the reliance on the GCD solely. There are combinations with common GCDs greater than `1` which still allow for adequate coverage of time seconds.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly address all potential combinations required by the problem statement. It relies solely on the GCD check, which is not sufficient for guaranteeing at least one garland is lit at every second.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers, k1, k2, and k3, from user input, which are constrained to be within the range of 1 to 1500. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers. If the GCD of the three integers is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and it directly prints the outcome. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or numbers outside the specified range), which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, it assumes input as space-separated integers without error handling for improper formatting.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
