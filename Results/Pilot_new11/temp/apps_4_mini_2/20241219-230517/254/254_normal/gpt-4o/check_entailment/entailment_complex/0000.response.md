To determine the correctness of the annotated program, we need to compare its functionality with the requirements set in the problem description.

### Analyzing the Problem Description

1. **Input Requirements**: Three integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) where \( 1 \leq k_i \leq 1500 \).
2. **Output Requirements**: 
   - Print "YES" if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit for every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).
   - Print "NO" if it is not possible.

### Analyzing the Annotated Program

The program checks the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three integers:

1. It calculates the GCD of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \), and then calculates the GCD of that result with \( k_3 \). 
2. It returns "YES" if the GCD of all three values is 1, meaning the numbers are coprime (i.e., they do not share any factors other than 1), thus ensuring the coverage of all integers.
3. It returns "NO" if the GCD of the three numbers is greater than 1, indicating there would be intervals of time without any garland being lit. 

### Logical Connection to the Problem

The requirement that there should be a lit garland at every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) can indeed be derived from whether the \( k_i \)'s are coprime or not:

- If \( \text{gcd}(k_1, k_2, k_3) = 1 \), it means that there is a potential overlap in their lit periods, and as such, at least one garland will always be lit.
- If \( \text{gcd}(k_1, k_2, k_3) > 1 \), this means that they share a common factor, indicating there could be moments in time when no garland is lit.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem by utilizing the GCD to determine whether it is possible for the garlands to ensure at least one is lit during all the required seconds. Each condition whereby it prints "YES" or "NO" aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Hence, considering these points:

Correctness: **True**
