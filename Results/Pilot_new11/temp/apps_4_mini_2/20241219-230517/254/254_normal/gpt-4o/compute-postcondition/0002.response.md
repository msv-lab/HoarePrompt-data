In the given code snippet, `gcd_all` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `gcd_k1_k2` (which is the gcd of `k_1` and `k_2`) and `k_3`. The variables in the initial state are not directly affected, except for `gcd_all`. 

Since `gcd_k1_k2` is defined as the gcd of `k_1` and `k_2`, and knowing that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range 1 to 1500, we can determine that `gcd_all` will also be a valid integer. However, its specific value cannot be determined without knowing the actual values of `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3`.

The updated variable is `gcd_all`, which now holds the value of `math.gcd(math.gcd(k_1, k_2), k_3)`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range 1 to 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k_3)`**.
