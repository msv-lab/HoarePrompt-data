Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a hypothetical matrix. It checks the validity of a sequence of coordinates derived from a global list `a`. Specifically, it iterates through each value in the list `a`, converting each integer into matrix-like coordinates (`nx`, `ny`). The function verifies that the movement from one coordinate to the next (calculated from adjacent elements in `a`) is a valid step (specifically, a step to an adjacent cell in the matrix). If any step does not conform to this criterion, the function returns `False`. If all steps are valid, it returns `True`. Notably, the code lacks validation for the input list `a`, including checks for its length or whether all elements in `a` fall within the specified range. Additionally, the initial values of `px` and `py` are conditionally referenced but could be affected by the list `a`, which is assumed but not guaranteed to be defined within the scope. Therefore, there could be a risk of reference errors if `a` is not provided.**
