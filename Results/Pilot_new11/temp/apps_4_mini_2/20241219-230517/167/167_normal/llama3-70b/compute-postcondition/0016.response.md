The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. According to the initial state, `px` is now assigned the value of `nx`, and `py` is assigned the value of `ny`. Since these assignments do not affect the conditions or the computation of `nx` and `ny`, all other variable states remain unchanged. The state of `px` is updated to be equal to `nx`, and the state of `py` is updated to be equal to `ny`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element of the list `a`; `nx` equals (v - 1) // `y`; `ny` equals (v - 1) % `y`; `px` is now equal to `nx`; `py` is now equal to `ny`.**
