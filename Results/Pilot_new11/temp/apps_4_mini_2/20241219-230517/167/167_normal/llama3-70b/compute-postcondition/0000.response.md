The variables `px` and `py` are both assigned the value `0`. This directly modifies their previous values, but since their initial values were not defined, the relevant output state can indicate that they are now both `0`. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `y` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0**
