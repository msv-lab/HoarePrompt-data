The code assigns `True` to the entry of `visited` corresponding to `node`, marking the node as visited. The previous states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` represents the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing the directed edges, `visited` is a set of integers which now includes `node` marked as `True`, and `rec_stack` is a set of integers used to track the recursion stack of vertices.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing the directed edges, `visited` is a set of integers including `node` marked as `True`, `rec_stack` is a set of integers used to track the recursion stack of vertices.**
