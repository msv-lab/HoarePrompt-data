Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `visited` includes `node`, `rec_stack` includes `node`, and `visited[neighbor]` is true for every neighbor of `node`. The current value of `rec_stack` indicates that the `neighbor` is in the recursion stack.***
