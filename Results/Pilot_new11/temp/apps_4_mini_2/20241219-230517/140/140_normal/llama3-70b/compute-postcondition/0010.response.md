Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `visited` includes `node`, `rec_stack` includes `node`, and `visited[neighbor]` is true for every neighbor of `node`. Additionally, `rec_stack[neighbor]` is false for every neighbor of `node`.***
