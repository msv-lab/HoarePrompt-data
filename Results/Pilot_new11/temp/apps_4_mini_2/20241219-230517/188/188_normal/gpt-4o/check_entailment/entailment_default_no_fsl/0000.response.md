To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to closely analyze its logic against the problem description and examples given.

### Problem Description Recap
Petya and Vasya want to choose numbers from an even number of cards such that each player can choose a different number, and both can take an equal number of cards. The output should be "YES" if it's possible to achieve this and specify the two numbers; otherwise, it should print "NO".

### Program Logic Assessment
1. **Count Frequency**: The code uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each unique number on the cards.
2. **Check Unique Numbers**: If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it outputs "NO" as itâ€™s impossible to have two distinct choices.
3. **Check for Equal Distribution**:
   - It sorts unique numbers based on their frequency.
   - It checks if the two most frequent unique numbers appear exactly `n // 2` times.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by these two numbers; if not, it prints "NO".

### Key Edge Cases Analysis
1. **All Cards Same**: If all cards have the same value (e.g., [6, 6]), the output should be "NO". The program seems to handle this correctly.
2. **Different Frequencies**: If unique counts don't split evenly (e.g., [10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 20]), the output should be "NO". Again, the program handles this correctly.
3. **Exact Half Required**: If two numbers are present but do not have half each (e.g., [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]), the output should also be "NO". The code handles this scenario correctly.

### Existing Cases from the Problem
- The provided output hints suggest that if the two most frequent numbers do not both appear `n // 2` times or there are not at least two unique numbers, it results in "NO". This logic also appears accurately handled in the code.

### Conclusion on Code Correctness
Upon examination of the logic and the edge cases mentioned, all are covered accurately in the program. The core requirement of distributing the cards fairly according to the rules outlined in the problem statement is consistently checked.

### Final Assessment
Therefore, the program indeed matches the problem requirements for every potential case encountered based on the provided examples and situation logic outlined.

Correctness: **True**
