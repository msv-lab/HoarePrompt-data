The variable `unique_numbers` is assigned the value of the sorted list of unique keys from the `count` object, which represents the frequencies of the integers in the `cards` list. The keys are sorted based on their frequency in ascending order. The initial states of `n`, `cards`, and `count` remain valid as they do not change during this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency distribution of `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique keys from `count` based on their frequency.**
