You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27

Output
YES
11 27

3

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its logic in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Petya and Vasya have `n` cards (where `n` is even).
- Each card has a single integer.
- For the game to be fair:
  - Both players must choose distinct integers from the cards.
  - The total number of cards taken by both players must equal `n`.
  - Each player should take an equal number of cards.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads `n`, the number of cards, and the card values into a list.
  
2. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each number appears on the cards.

3. **Unique Numbers**:
   - It sorts the unique card numbers.

4. **Logic for Fairness**:
   - The first condition checks if there are at least two different card numbers: `len(unique_numbers) < 2`.
   - Then, it checks if the two most frequent numbers (last two in the sorted list) each have counts equal to `n // 2`. If so, it prints "YES" and those two numbers.

5. **Otherwise, it prints "NO"**.

### Critical Cases for Verification:

1. **Case with More Than Two Unique Numbers**:
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     1
     2
     3
     1
     2
     3
     ```
   - The program will print "NO", but it can have many valid selections (e.g., Petya chooses 1 and Vasya chooses 2). The counts for 1, 2, and 3 are equal, which could give fair distribution errors.

2. **All Cards the Same**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     5
     5
     5
     5
     ```
   - The program correctly detects only one unique number and outputs "NO".

3. **N is a valid even number but no fair configuration**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     10
     10
     20
     20
     ```
   - The program would output "YES", but actually with two distinct numbers (both have 2), they can’t take 4.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to accurately account for scenarios where there could be multiple unique numbers, leading to a situation where Petya and Vasya could still select a valid pair that allows them to split the cards evenly but is not being utilized correctly in its checks.

Thus, it is incorrect given these edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) from input, followed by `n` integers representing cards (each between 1 and 100 inclusive). It counts the frequency of each unique card and sorts them by their frequency. If there are fewer than two unique card values, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least two unique card values, it checks if the two most frequent cards both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by the two card values; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. In cases where the input does not follow the expected format (non-integer values, odd `n`, etc.), the function lacks error handling and will cause a runtime error instead of gracefully managing those scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
