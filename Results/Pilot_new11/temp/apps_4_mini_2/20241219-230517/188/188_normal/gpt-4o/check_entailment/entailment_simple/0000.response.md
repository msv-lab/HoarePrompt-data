To determine whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, let's analyze the functionality step-by-step.

### Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. There is an even number `n` of cards.
2. Each card has an integer value.
3. Petya and Vasya need to pick distinct integers to ensure:
   - All `n` cards can be accounted for.
   - Both players take an equal number of cards.

### Breakdown of the Provided Program:
- The program reads the integer `n`, and then reads `n` integers representing the card values.
- It utilizes the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each unique integer.
- The program retrieves the unique integers, sorts them by their frequency, and then checks the following conditions:
  - It first checks if there are at least two unique integers.
  - If there are at least two, it checks if the two most frequent numbers occur exactly `n / 2` times each. If they do, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Case Analysis:
1. If the input consists of more than two distinct integers but none of them occur `n/2` times, it would produce "NO", which is correct.
2. If there are exactly two distinct integers, it will check if they can balance out the cards correctly, also as needed.
3. If all cards are the same, the program correctly outputs "NO", as Vasya cannot pick a different number.
4. When there are not enough unique integers to choose from (less than 2), the program outputs "NO", in line with the requirements.

### Identified Issues:
However, the program has a flaw:
- It checks only the last two unique numbers' frequencies to see if they are both `n / 2`. This means if the card distribution is something like (e.g., 1,1,2,2,3) where the counts are not even for the last two numbers, it will output "NO" even if other combinations of numbers could allow for fair picks.

### Conclusion:
Because the program does not account for all potential valid distributions of card numbers that might allow a fair game (e.g., a situation where more than two distinct numbers exist), it may incorrectly conclude that it's impossible even when a fair game is possible.

Based on the flaws noted, particularly the incorrect condition checking when there can be multiple valid distributions, the output will not always match the requirements. It overlooks valid scenarios, thus violating the problem's description.

Correctness: **False**
