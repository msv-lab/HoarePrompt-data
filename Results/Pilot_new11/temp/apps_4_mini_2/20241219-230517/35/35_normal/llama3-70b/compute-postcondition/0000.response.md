The line of code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` based on user input. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` were previously constrained by the conditions given in the initial state, this line of code will replace their values with whatever integers the user inputs. The specific integers must satisfy the conditions stated: `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. 

Other variables remain unchanged, and the output state should reflect the updated values of `n`, `a`, and `b` after input is taken.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers based on user input satisfying the conditions; specifically, `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`.**
