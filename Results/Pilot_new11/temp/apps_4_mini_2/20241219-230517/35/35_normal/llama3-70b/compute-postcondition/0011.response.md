According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fact that it is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always continue executing as it has no exit condition. Thus, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time; it will always run indefinitely regardless of the current state.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`**
