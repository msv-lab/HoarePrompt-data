To determine the output state after the loop has executed all necessary times, consider that the loop continues decrementing `x` until the condition `a >= x` and `b >= x` and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is satisfied.

**Output State:**
`x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed until the condition was satisfied, `a - (min(n, a, b) - k) + (b - (min(n, a, b) - k)) >= (min(n, a, b) - k)` must remain true for all k iterations; `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. `x` must satisfy `x ≥ 0` upon loop termination.
