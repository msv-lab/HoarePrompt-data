Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely without any specified termination condition. Therefore, the loop is guaranteed to execute one more time. As such, there are no necessary adjustments needed for any of the variables for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 1**
