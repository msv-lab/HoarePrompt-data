Output State: **`x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed until the condition was satisfied; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, and `x` satisfies `x ≥ 0` upon loop termination.**
