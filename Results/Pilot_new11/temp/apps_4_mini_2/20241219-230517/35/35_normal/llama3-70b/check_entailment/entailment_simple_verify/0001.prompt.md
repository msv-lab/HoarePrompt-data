You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the specified problem description, we need to ensure that the program meets all the conditions given.

The problem states that:
1. Each piece of cake must be distributed.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece.
3. No plate should contain pieces from both cakes.
4. We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate.

The program attempts to find the maximum possible number \( x \) that satisfies these conditions through a decreasing loop from the minimum of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). 

However, let's examine the code closely:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)
```

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Logic for the While Loop**: 
   - The line `if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x)` checks if enough pieces can be distributed while ensuring all plates have at least \( x \) pieces. However, this doesn't adequately ensure that all plates are being served properly. The logic around `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is misleading because it doesn't guarantee all conditions are met when you decrease \( x \).

2. **Start Condition for \( x \)**: 
   - The initial value for \( x \) is set to the minimum of \( n, a, b \), which is incorrect when distributed incorrectly. This shouldn't be the sole limit; it should also respect the division of the pieces into plates satisfying all conditions.

3. **Example Testing**:
   - Consider the input `n = 3, a = 4, b = 4`. According to the requirements, the maximum \( x \) should be `2` since each of the three plates can get a minimum of two pieces, allocating in such a way that satisfies all constraints. However, the program starts from `3` and counts down. In this case, it would incorrectly output `1` instead of `2`.

### Conclusion

Given these issues, especially with how the global constraints and specific checks are handled in determining \( x \), the code does not cover all required conditions for potentially valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

There exist potential cases where the program would not produce the correct outputs, specifically for scenarios where the allocation of pieces across plates is not uniformly satisfied. For example, inputs like `3, 4, 4` should yield different outputs than those provided by the program. The logic fails to ensure that it can distribute the pieces correctly while maintaining the necessary conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake where 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake where 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after the loop has executed all necessary times, consider that the loop continues decrementing `x` until the condition `a >= x` and `b >= x` and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is satisfied.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #`x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed until the condition was satisfied, `a - (min(n, a, b) - k) + (b - (min(n, a, b) - k)) >= (min(n, a, b) - k)` must remain true for all k iterations; `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. `x` must satisfy `x ≥ 0` upon loop termination.
    print(x)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
