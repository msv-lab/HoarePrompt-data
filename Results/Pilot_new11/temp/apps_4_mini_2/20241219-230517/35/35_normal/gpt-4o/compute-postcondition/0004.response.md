The variable `low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(1 + high) // 2`, where `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, which means `mid` is calculated as the floor of half of `high`. As a consequence, `low` will now be greater than its previous value. The other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(1 + high) // 2`, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.**
