Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is updated to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is updated to `(1 + high) // 2`. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, then `low` remains 1, `high` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` is updated to `(1 + high) // 2`.***
