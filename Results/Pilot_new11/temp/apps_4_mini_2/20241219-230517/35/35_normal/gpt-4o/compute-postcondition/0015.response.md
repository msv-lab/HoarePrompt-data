The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `high` must be greater than `low`, after updating `low`, it ensures that `low` becomes greater than `mid`. Therefore, the output state captures the new value of `low` based on the calculation from the previous state. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`; `high` must be greater than `low`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `low` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
