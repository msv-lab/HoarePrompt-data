Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, which is the value where `can_distribute(low - 1)` returned false. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, with `a` being an integer where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100 and `b` being an integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `can_distribute(mid)` returned true during the iterations, then `mid` would reflect a successful condition of distribution up to the last tested midpoint. If executed in the loop, `low` was incremented until it reached the final value of `high`, which is `min(a, b) + 1` or less based on previous checks and updates. If the function `can_distribute(mid)` never returned true, `high` would eventually become `1` and `low` would remain `1`, thus concluding with `low` equaling `high`.**
