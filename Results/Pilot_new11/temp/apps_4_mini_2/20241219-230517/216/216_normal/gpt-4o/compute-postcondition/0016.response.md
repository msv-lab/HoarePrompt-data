According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue iterating through the characters of the string `s` as long as there are characters left to process. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the first character of `s`. As `char` represents the character currently being processed in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `char` to reflect the next character in the string `s`. 

Since `s` is not empty, after processing the first character (which is `char`), there must be more characters left in the string for the loop to iterate over. Hence, `char` will now become the second character of the string `s`, and the length of `s` will still be `n`. 

The updated states would be: `current_set` could potentially include the new `char` (if it is a lowercase letter), and `current_count` will need to be updated based on whether the new `char` satisfies the lowercase condition.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the relevant states should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` may contain `char`, and `current_count` is set to 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter, or 0 otherwise.**
