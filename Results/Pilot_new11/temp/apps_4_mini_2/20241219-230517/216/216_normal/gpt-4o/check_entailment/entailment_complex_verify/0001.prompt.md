You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify whether it accurately addresses the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. 

The program iterates over the string `s`, building a set of distinct lowercase letters and counting them until it encounters an uppercase letter, at which point it checks whether the previously counted distinct letters exceed the maximum recorded so far. The set is then cleared to start counting from the next segment of the string.

Let's review how the program handles several potential edge cases:

1. **All uppercases**: For an input like `ABC`, the expected output is `0`, and the program correctly outputs `0` since there are no lowercase letters.

2. **Single lowercase letter with uppercase before and after**: For an input like `AaA`, the expected output is `1` since only 'a' counts, and the program handles this correctly.

3. **Adjacent lowercase letters**: For an input like `aabAc`, the expected output is `2`, as it can take positions `1` and `3`. The program will end up counting both 'a's before it hits 'A' which resets the count to `0`. It correctly records the maximum for those segments too.

4. **Multiple segments of lowercase letters**: For an input like `aabbAaa`, the expected output is `2` since between segments determined by `A`, there are up to 2 distinct letters in both. The program checks and counts correctly.

5. **A mix of upper cases and lower cases**: If we take a more complex case like `zACaAbbaazzC`, we have distinct opportunities to pick segments. In this case, it correctly calculates a maximum of `3` for segments that can be `b`,`a`, and `z`.

However, the critical point of failure in the implementation can arise from how it handles repetition of letters in the segments:

Consider the input `aAaa`, where the expected result is `1` (because only one 'a' counts). The program counts `2` when it processes the last segment of lowercase letters (`a`, `a`) after the last uppercase letter (`A`), as it does not correctly handle multiple occurrences of the same character in a segment. Hence, it can fail to correctly identify the maximum distinct letters when there are repeats.

With this in mind, we can generate the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The failure case provided serves as a clarification that the implementation does not correctly manage segments with repeated lowercase letters, leading to an incorrect maximum count being reported.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string s, and s is a string consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length equal to n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is the maximum number of unique lowercase letters encountered consecutively in `s`, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0. If `s` contains no lowercase letters, `max_count` will be 0. If there are consecutive lowercase letters in `s`, `max_count` will be the largest number of distinct lowercase letters between non-lowercase characters.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It determines the maximum number of unique lowercase letters that appear consecutively in `s`, resetting the count whenever a non-lowercase character is encountered. After processing, it prints this maximum count. If the string consists solely of non-lowercase characters, the output will be `0`. Additionally, there is no handling for invalid input or cases where the string may be empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function does not accept parameters, it operates directly on user input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
