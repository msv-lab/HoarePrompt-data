The code `current_set.clear()` clears the `current_set`, which means it will be empty after executing this line. The values of the other variables are not affected, so we still have the initial values intact. The `max_count` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is set to 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter, or 0 otherwise, and `max_count` remains unchanged.
