To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the logic accurately adheres to the requirements specified.

The problem requires identifying the maximum number of distinct lowercase letter positions in a string (denoted as a pretty set) while ensuring that no uppercase letters exist between those positions. The given program attempts to do this by only collecting the indices of lowercase characters without considering the constraints involving uppercase letters.

Here are some cases to consider that demonstrate where the program fails:

1. **Case with Non-Contiguous Lowercase Letters:**
   Input: 
   ```
   7
   aAcaBc
   ```
   Expected Output: `2` (as we can take positions 0 and 2, or positions 2 and 4, but the program will output `4` because it counts all lowercase indices `[0, 2, 4]`). 

2. **Case with Multiple Uppercase Letters:**
   Input:
   ```
   10
   aBcDeFgHiJ
   ```
   Expected Output: `1` (only position 0). The program will incorrectly output `4` since it counts all lowercase letters without considering the uppercase letters present that separate them.

3. **Case where lowercase letters do not exist:**
   Input:
   ```
   5
   ABCDE
   ```
   Output: `0`. This case is correctly handled by the program but highlighting it shows that while it might handle this correctly, the presence of uppercase letters throughout other cases is not accounted for.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no uppercase letters exist between the positions of lowercase letters chosen nor does it count distinct lowercase letters properly in contiguous segments.

Thus, because the program fails in the examples above, the correctness is determined to be:

Correctness: **False**.
