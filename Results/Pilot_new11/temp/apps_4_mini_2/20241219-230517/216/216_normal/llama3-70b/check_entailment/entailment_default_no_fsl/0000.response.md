Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to count the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it fails to correctly solve the problem described. Based on the problem statement, a "pretty" set must consist of distinct lowercase letters that are not interrupted by any uppercase letters. The code does not check whether the lowercase letters are distinct or if they are separated by uppercase letters. 

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```
The output of the provided program would be `2`, since it simply counts the number of lowercase letters (`a` in this case appears four times), which is incorrect because the set must consist of distinct lowercase letters without interruptions of uppercase letters.

Another specific failure case is the input:
```
10
aAaaBbbC
```
Here, the program would return `4` as it counts `a` and `b` repeatedly without considering distinctiveness or interruptions, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program does not adequately address the criteria for determining a "pretty" set, leading to systematic errors in its output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is evaluated as false.
