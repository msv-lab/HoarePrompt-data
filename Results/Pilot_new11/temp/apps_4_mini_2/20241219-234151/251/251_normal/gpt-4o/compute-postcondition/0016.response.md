The statement `dp[i] = volumes[i]` indicates that the value of `dp[i]` is directly assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The precondition indicates that `dp[i]` was previously the maximum value of `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` from 0 to `i_prev` where `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.

Since `dp[i]` is now set to `volumes[i]`, this will overwrite whatever maximum value computed earlier. The variables `n`, `i`, and `dp` (specifically `dp[i]`) are affected. However, we don't change `n` and `i` in this operation.

The state after executing the code will show that `dp[i]` is now equal to `volumes[i]`, without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**.
