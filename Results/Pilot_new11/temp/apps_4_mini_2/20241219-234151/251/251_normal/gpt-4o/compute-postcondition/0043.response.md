The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cakes and must satisfy the condition 1 <= n <= 100000. It also accepts a parameter `cakes`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `r` and `h`, representing the radius and height of each cake, with the constraints 1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10000. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake considering all valid stackings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of cakes. It returns the maximum volume obtainable for stacking the cakes.**
