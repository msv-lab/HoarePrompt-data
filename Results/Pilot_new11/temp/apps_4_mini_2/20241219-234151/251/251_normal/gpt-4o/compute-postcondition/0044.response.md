Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` containing tuples of two integers (representing the radius `r` and height `h` of each cake). It calculates the volume of each cake and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum possible volume obtainable by stacking the cakes, ensuring that a cake can only be placed on top of another if its volume is greater. After iterating through all cakes, the function returns the maximum volume obtainable from the list `dp`, which holds the maximum volume for each cake considering all valid stackings. The function does not handle the case where `n` is zero explicitly, but given the constraints (1 â‰¤ n), this is not an edge case in practice. The function assumes all inputs follow the specified constraints.**
