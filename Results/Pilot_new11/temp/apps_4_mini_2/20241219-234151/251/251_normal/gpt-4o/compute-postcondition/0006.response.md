Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes input data to read the number of cakes and their respective dimensions (radius and height). It accepts input in a specific format, converts this data into a structured list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_1` with the number of cakes and the list of cake dimensions. The result from `func_1` is formatted as a floating-point number with six decimal places and printed. However, it does not handle potential issues related to invalid input formats or values outside the expected range. Additionally, the behavior of `func_1` is not specified, so the output of `func_2` depends on its implementation, which is not detailed here. There is also no error handling for cases where the input might not adhere to the expected structure, which could lead to runtime errors.**
