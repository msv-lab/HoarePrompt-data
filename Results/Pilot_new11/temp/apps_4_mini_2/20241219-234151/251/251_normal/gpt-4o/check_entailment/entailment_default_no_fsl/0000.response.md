Correctness: **True**

The provided code appropriately follows the requirements stated in the problem description. The `func_1` function computes the volumes of the cakes based on their given radius and height and then uses a dynamic programming approach to determine the maximum possible volume of a stacked cake. The conditions for stacking cakes are respected, specifically ensuring that a cake can only be placed on another if its volume is strictly greater.

The implementation effectively handles the specified constraints, since it iterates through the list of cakes and calculates possible total volumes accurately. It also correctly formats the output with six decimal places, which aligns with the output requirement.

Additionally, since the problem specifies valid input scenarios where `n` is always at least 1 and each radius and height are within the defined constraints, the implementation adheres to those assumptions without needing explicit error handling for invalid inputs. 

Given these observations and by validating against the problem requirements and provided examples, I conclude that the program has been implemented correctly for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
