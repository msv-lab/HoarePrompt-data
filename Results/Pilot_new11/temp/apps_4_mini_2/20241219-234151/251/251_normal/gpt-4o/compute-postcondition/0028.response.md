According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop is set to execute for `i` values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. Therefore, to determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given that `i_prev` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, we can say that for the next iteration:
- `i` will now be `i_prev + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `i_prev + 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now `i_prev + 2`) must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the state reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that the condition for the loop to run again is met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value obtained by evaluating `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains equal to `volumes[i]`.**
