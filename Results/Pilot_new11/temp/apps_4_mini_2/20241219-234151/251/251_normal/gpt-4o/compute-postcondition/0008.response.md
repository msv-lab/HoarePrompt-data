According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` in relation to `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 1. Additionally, `n` remains a positive integer and does not change.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.**
