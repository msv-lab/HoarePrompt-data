Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`; the remaining elements in the `dp` list are initialized to 0.0, and `j` is 0.***
