The operation appends a new tuple to the list `cakes`, where the tuple consists of three values: the volume of a cylinder calculated as `math.pi * r * r * h`, along with the values of `r` and `h`. Since `n` is an input positive integer, its value does not change with the append operation. The variable `cakes` is updated to include the new tuple representing the cylinder's volume and dimensions.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is a list containing the previous elements plus the new tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer.**
