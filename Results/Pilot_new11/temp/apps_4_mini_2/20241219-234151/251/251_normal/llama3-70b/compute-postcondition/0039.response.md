Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. When this condition holds, `i` becomes `k + 1` and `j` resets to `0`. If the condition does not hold, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, and the indices `i` and `j` are unaffected.***
