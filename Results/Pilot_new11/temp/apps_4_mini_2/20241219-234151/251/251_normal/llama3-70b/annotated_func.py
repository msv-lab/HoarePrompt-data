#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), and for each cake i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), r_i and h_i are integers representing the radius and height of the cake, respectively, where (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)` for each input pair of integers `r` and `h`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[i]` is the maximum value achievable by considering all previous `cakes[j]` for `j` in the range of [0, i-1] such that `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, initialized such that `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and all other `dp[j]` for `j` in the range [1, n-1] contain the best achievable values based on the comparisons; if no valid `j` exists for any `i`, `dp[i]` retains its initialized value `cakes[i][0]`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius `r_i` and height `h_i` of each cake. It computes the volume of each cake using the formula `math.pi * r_i^2 * h_i` and stores them in a list of tuples alongside their respective dimensions. The function then sorts this list by volume in descending order. It uses dynamic programming to compute a maximum cumulative volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes, subject to the constraint that a cake can only be placed on top of another if both its radius and height are smaller than those of the cake below it. Finally, the function prints the maximum achievable volume. If no cakes can be stacked, the output will be the volume of the largest cake alone. The function does not handle inputs that have invalid values, such as non-integer types or out-of-bounds values for `n`, `r`, or `h`, which could potentially lead to runtime errors.
