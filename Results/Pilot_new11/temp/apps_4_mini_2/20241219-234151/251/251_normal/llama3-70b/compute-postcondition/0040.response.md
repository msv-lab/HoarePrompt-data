Output State: **`dp` is a list where `dp[n-1]` holds the maximum sum of `cakes[k][0]` for valid `k` values (where `cakes[n-1][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[n-1][2] < cakes[k][2]`), and all other `dp[j]` for `j` in the range `0` to `n-2` remain either their original values or unchanged if no valid `j` was found; `i` is still `n-1`, and `j` is `0` after all iterations. If there are no indices `j` where the conditions hold for `j < i`, `dp[n-1]` will remain as its original value `cakes[n-1][0]`.**
