The code initializes `cakes` as an empty list. Since `n` is an input positive integer, its value remains unchanged by this operation. The state of other variables is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is an empty list**
