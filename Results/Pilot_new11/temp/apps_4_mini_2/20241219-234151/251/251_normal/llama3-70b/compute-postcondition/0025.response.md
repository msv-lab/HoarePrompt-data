The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. Since `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` hold true, the condition allows the update to `dp[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `dp`, and `j` remain unchanged, aside from the updated `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 1.**
