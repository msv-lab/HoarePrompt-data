According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must take values from `0` to `i-1`, meaning `i` must be greater than `0`. 

Since the last iteration finished, `i` is now incremented (let's say its previous value was `k`, then `i` is `k + 1`). Thus, `j` will take values from `0` up to `k`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again with the condition still valid, `i` must be at least `1`, which means `j` can take at least `0` as a valid value.

State: **`dp` is a list where if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j]` plus `cakes[i][0]`; `i` is now `k + 1`, and `j` resets to `0`.**
