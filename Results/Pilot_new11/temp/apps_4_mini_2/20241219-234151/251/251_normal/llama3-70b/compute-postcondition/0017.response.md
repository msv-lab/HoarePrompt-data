According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since the loop iterates `j` from 0 to `i-1`, for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 (which it is, as `i` is 1). Therefore, the loop will run a single iteration with `j` taking the value of 0.

The states do not need further adjustments since the provided state satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `dp` is a list containing `n` elements with `dp[0]` equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and the remaining elements initialized to 0.0, `j` is 0**
