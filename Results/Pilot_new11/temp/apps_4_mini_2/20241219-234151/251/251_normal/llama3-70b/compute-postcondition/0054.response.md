Output State: **`dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[i]` is the maximum value achievable by considering all previous `cakes[j]` for `j` in the range of [0, i-1] such that `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, initialized such that `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and all other `dp[j]` for `j` in the range [1, n-1] contain the best achievable values based on the comparisons; if no valid `j` exists for any `i`, `dp[i]` retains its initialized value `cakes[i][0]`.**
