`G_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'G' in the string `line`. The value of `line` consists of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', and since 'G' exists in the string, its index is defined. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.**
