Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is now equal to `T_pos`, `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos`. The current value of `G_pos` is less than the current value of `T_pos`.**
