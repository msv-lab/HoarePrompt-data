The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and an integer `k`, where `n` is constrained such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n - 1 \). Additionally, the second input is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' (representing the starting position) and 'T' (representing the target position) each appear exactly once in the string.

The function operates based on these inputs and returns a result. However, the specifics of the output were not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot detail the output beyond recognizing that it is based on these constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with a string of length `n` containing the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.**
