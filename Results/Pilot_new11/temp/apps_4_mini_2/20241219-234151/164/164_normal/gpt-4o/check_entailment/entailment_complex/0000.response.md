To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s walk through the logic of the program step-by-step, while referring back to the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The grasshopper can start at position 'G' and needs to reach position 'T' using jumps of length 'k'.
2. The characters in the string represent different states: 
   - '.' means an empty cell.
   - '#' means an obstacle that cannot be jumped over.
   - 'G' is the grasshopper's starting point.
   - 'T' is the target insect's position.
3. The output should be "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the insect, and "NO" otherwise.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two integers, `n` and `k`, followed by the string `line`. The input constraints are respected (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1).

2. **Finding Positions of G and T**: The program identifies the indices of 'G' and 'T' in the string using `line.index('G')` and `line.index('T')`.

3. **Order Correction**: It ensures that `G_pos` is always less than `T_pos` to simplify the logic for jumping toward 'T'.

4. **Jump Simulation**: The program iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos`, incrementing by `k`. For each jump:
   - It checks if the current position has an obstacle ('#'). If an obstacle is encountered, the loop breaks.
   - If the current position is 'T', it sets `reachable` to True and breaks the loop.

5. **Output Logic**: Finally, based on the value of `reachable`, it prints "YES" or "NO".

### Verifying Correctness:
- **Jump Logic**: The program correctly simulates jumping from 'G' to 'T', and it effectively handles obstacles, adhering to the requirements of the problem description.
- **Order Handling**: By ensuring `G_pos` is less than `T_pos`, the program methodically checks all possible landing spots in the correct direction.
- **Output Matching**: The outputs "YES" and "NO" are provided exactly as specified in the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
The program handles several scenarios:
- Direct jumps without obstacles.
- Scenarios where 'G' is unable to reach 'T' due to obstacles.
- It also implicitly handles situations where 'G' and 'T' are located close to each other.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and logically simulates the behavior of the grasshopper. It correctly identifies reachable paths based on the provided constraints and outputs the appropriate response.

Therefore, the final judgment is:

Correctness: **True**
