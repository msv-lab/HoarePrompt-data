To determine the states that need adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop is defined as `for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k)`. This means `pos` starts at `G_pos` and goes up to and including `T_pos`, incrementing by `k` in each iteration of the loop.

2. **State Specifics**:
   - The range for `pos` in the loop requires that `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
   - Given the earlier condition that if `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to `T_pos` and vice versa, this condition ensures that `G_pos` can never be greater than `T_pos` when the loop starts.

3. **Range Calculation**: For the loop to execute:
   - The starting value of `pos` (i.e., `G_pos`) must be less than or equal to the stopping point of the range (i.e., `T_pos`).
   - The step size `k` is guaranteed to be greater than 0 (since `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`), meaning it will always move forward.

4. **Initial States**:
   - We need to ensure that `G_pos` starts at a value that is less than or equal to `T_pos` when first entering the loop, otherwise the loop will not execute.

5. **Final Condition**:
   - Under the guidelines provided, if `G_pos` is updated to be less than `T_pos` before the loop starts, it satisfies the loop's range condition.

So the necessary states we need to list are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1, `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False**.
