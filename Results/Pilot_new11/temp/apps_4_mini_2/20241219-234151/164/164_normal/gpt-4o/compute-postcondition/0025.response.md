The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as no conditions or calculations directly affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; `pos` is `G_pos + 2k`; `reachable` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; `pos` is `G_pos + 2k`; `reachable` is True.**
