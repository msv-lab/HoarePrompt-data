Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; and `reachable` is False, indicating that `G_pos` cannot reach `T_pos` without hitting a '#'.***
