The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes a string input from the user. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is the second input integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `s` is an input string.**
