The value of `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and `t` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', `t` is 2**.
