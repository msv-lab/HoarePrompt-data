Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string. If `s[i]` is 'G', then `g` is set to 0 and `t` remains -1. Otherwise, `g` stays -1, `t` is either -1 or 0 depending on whether `s[i]` is 'T', and `i` remains at 0 with the character at index `i` of string `s` being not 'G'.***
