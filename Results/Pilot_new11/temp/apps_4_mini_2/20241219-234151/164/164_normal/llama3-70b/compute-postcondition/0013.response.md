In the provided code snippet, the value of `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The value of `i` is explicitly mentioned to be 1, and `t` can initially be -1 or 0 depending on the condition of `s[i]`. After the execution of the code, `t` will become 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `g`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', `g` is -1, `t` is 1.**
