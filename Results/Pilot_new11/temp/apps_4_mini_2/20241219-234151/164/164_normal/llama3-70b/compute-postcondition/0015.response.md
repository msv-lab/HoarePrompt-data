Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` becomes 1, and `t` remains -1 or 0 depending on `s[i]`. Otherwise, `g` is -1, and if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is updated to 1.***
