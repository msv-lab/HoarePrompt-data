The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables remain unchanged because this assignment does not affect them. The value of `g` will now be equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', `g` is now 1, and `t` is either -1 or 0 depending on whether `s[i]` is 'T'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', `g` is 1, `t` is either -1 or 0 depending on whether `s[i]` is 'T'**.
