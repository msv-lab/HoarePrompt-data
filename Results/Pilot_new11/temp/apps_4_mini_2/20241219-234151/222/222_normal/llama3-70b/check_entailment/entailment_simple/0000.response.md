To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description Requirements
1. **Input**: The function must read two integers `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned from each side when one skewer is turned).
2. **Output**:
   - The function must print the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers (`l`).
   - The function must print the indices of the skewers that need to be turned over in those actions.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program
1. **Input Handling**:  
   The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k`.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Actions**:  
   The program calculates `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This correctly computes the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Given that each action flips `k` skewers on each side plus the one skewer being turned, the effective range of each action is `2k + 1` skewers.

3. **Generating the Turn Indices**:
   The program generates the indices of skewers to be turned using:
   ```python
   res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
   ```
   - This formula generates the first skewer to turn in each action based on the number of skewers that can be turned in a single action. Starting from skewer 1, subsequent actions effectively jump `(k * 2 + 1)` indices.
   
4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `l` correctly.
   - It prints the skewer indices derived in the previous step.

### Checking for Conformance
- The program accurately calculates the number of actions required based on the effective range of turning skewers and provides the correct skewer indices to achieve this in a manner consistent with the problem requirements.
- **Edge Cases**: 
   - When `k = 0`, each action will turn exactly one skewer. The program still handles this case by producing results based on the formula. 
   - For larger values of `k`, it doesn't miss any skewers because it always covers `2k + 1` skewers in each action.

### Conclusion
Every condition specified in the problem description is met. The program accurately calculates the minimum number of actions and provides the correct list of skewers to flip within the defined constraints.

Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
