The given program attempts to solve the problem of turning over skewers with the specified number of adjacent skewers affected by each turn. 

Let's break down the problem and examine the code:

1. The function reads input values `n` (the total number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned on each side for each action).
2. It calculates the minimum number of turns required to turn over all skewers using the formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This correctly accounts for the total number of skewers that can be turned over in each action.
3. The result list `res` is constructed by appending skewer indices based on the value of `i` multiplied by `(k * 2 + 1)` plus 1, which represents the starting skewers for each turn.
4. Finally, the function prints the number of actions `l` and the indices of the skewers turned.

After evaluating how the turnings operate:
- If `k` is 0, only the skewer itself is turned. This means the number of operations needed will equal `n` since each skewer has to be turned individually.
- If `k` is large enough (greater than or equal to `n/2`), one action can turn over all the skewers together. The calculated values will still correctly yield an action for the first skewer if `n` is not zero.
- The skewer numbers added to `res` are indeed valid and will lead to all skewers being turned over.

Examples provided in the problem statement align with expected outputs produced from the code. 

The hints correctly identify that the function is indeed addressing edge cases consistent with range boundaries for k and n, ensuring that the logic applies without any omissions.

**Conclusion:** The logic in the program holds true for all potential cases derived from the problem. Every skewer is turned over correctly without any missed cases. 

Correctness: **True**.
