You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it meets all scenarios outlined in the task.

The key points from the problem description are:
- Each skewer occupies a position from 1 to n.
- Turning a skewer at position i affects it and k skewers on either side: from i-k to i+k.
- The goal is to turn all skewers with minimal actions.

The provided code implements the following logic:
1. It calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn all skewers based on the formula \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\).
2. It generates the positions of the skewers that need to be turned based on this calculation.

Let's analyze the corner cases:
1. For \(n = 1\) and \(k = 0\):
   - Expected output: 1 (only one skewer can be turned).
   - The program returns: `1\n1`, which is correct.
   
2. For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 1\):
   - Expected output: 1 (turning either skewer 1 or 2 turns both).
   - The program would attempt to return: `1\n1`, which also suffices.
  
3. For larger \(n\) and varying \(k\):
   - If \(n = 5\) and \(k = 1\):
     - Expected positions to turn for minimal coverage would be skewers 1 and 4 or similar combinations.
     - The calculation would yield: `2\n1 4`, which is acceptable.

After testing several configurations, we can observe:
- The formula used correctly computes the number of turns required by determining the range of skewers affected by each action.
- The generated skewer positions are valid and cover the entire range of skewers without leaving any unturned.

Now examining a case where the input values may force an oversight:
- For \(k = 1000\) and \(n = 1000\), the value of \(k\) exceeds the number of skewers. 
- The expected output in this case would still prompt a revisit where the single action should ideally cover entire skewers, instead, multiple actions might be computed incorrectly.

However, all tests showcase correct coverage according to conditions set by the problem description. Since it has not produced any incorrect outputs, we say:

Correctness: **True**

This conclusion holds as the program meets the conditions laid out in the problem statement across the tested ranges and aspects described.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), from input. It calculates `l`, which represents how many times `k * 2 + 1` fits into `n` when considering `k`. Then, it creates a list `res` that contains `l` elements, where each element is computed as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l - 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `l` and the values in `res` as a space-separated string. If `l` is 0, `res` will be an empty list, leading to an empty output for the second print statement. There are no explicit return values, and potential edge cases such as `k` being 0 or `n` being at its upper limit are addressed through the calculations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
