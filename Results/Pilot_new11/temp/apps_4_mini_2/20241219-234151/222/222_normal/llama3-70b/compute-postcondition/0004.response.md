The code appends the value of `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is initially 0, we can calculate the new value that will be appended to `res`. The expression evaluates to:

- `k * 2 + 1` is a defined term based on `k`.
- Since `i` is 0, the multiplied result will also be 0.

Thus, the expression simplifies to `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which equals `1`. 

No other variables are affected by this operation; therefore, the output state reflects that the result `1` has been appended to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `i` is 0, `res` has a new value 1 appended to it.**
