The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is an empty list**
