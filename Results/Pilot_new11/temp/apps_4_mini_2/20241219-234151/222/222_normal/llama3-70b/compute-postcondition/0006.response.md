Let's analyze the given code step by step. 

1. We know that `i` is 1 and `k` must be known to compute `k * 2 + 1`. However, 'k' is not explicitly given a value, but for the sake of calculating `res`, we will refer to it in its formula form.
2. The expression for the element being appended to `res` is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which further simplifies to `k * 2 + 1 + 1`, leading to `(k * 2 + 2)`.
3. The `res` list is modified by appending the computed value `(k * 2 + 2)` to it.

All other preconditions remain valid as they are not altered by the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the values for `n`, `l`, `i`, and `res` (now including the new appended value).

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1) which must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` has a new value `k * 2 + 2` appended to it**
