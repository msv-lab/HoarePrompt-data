Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the skewers turned per action. The function calculates and collects the positions of skewers based on the formula `(i = i + 2 * k + 1)`, starting from 1, until `i` exceeds `n`. After constructing a list of positions, the function prints the number of positions collected and the positions themselves. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the return postconditions as the function does not return any value in the code; it only prints the results. Furthermore, based on the posted conditions, there are some logical checks related to returning specific values based on `k`, which are not represented in the code. Consequently, the function effectively outputs the total skewers that can be positioned given `k`, but lacks the explicit return logic described in the postconditions. Therefore, it's important to note that the behavior outlined in the return postconditions is incomplete in the provided code.**
