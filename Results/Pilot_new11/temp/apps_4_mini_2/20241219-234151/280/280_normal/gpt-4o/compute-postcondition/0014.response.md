The function `func` accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. Here are their constraints: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `v_1`, `v_2` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10. However, the output is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` based on defined integer constraints, but the return value and the behavior of the function are not specified.**
