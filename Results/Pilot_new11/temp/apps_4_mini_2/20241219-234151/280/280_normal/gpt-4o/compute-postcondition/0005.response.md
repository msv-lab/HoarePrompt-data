To analyze the loop and understand the required states for its execution, we need to consider the range defined in the for loop: `range(1, t)`. This range means that the loop will execute for `i` values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 2.

Next, let's review the initial provided states:

1. **`v_1`** is the first input integer.
2. **`v_2`** is the second input integer.
3. **`t`** is an integer such that **2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100**.
4. **`d`** is an integer such that **0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**.
5. **`speeds`** is a list with `t` elements, where `speeds[0]` equals `v_1` and `speeds[-1]` equals `v_2`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `t` must be at least 2 for the loop to run, we have a valid condition already given.
- The value of `i` will start at 1 (the first iteration) and will end at `t-1`, which means `i` will take on the values from 1 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.

### Required Adjustments:
For the loop to execute:
- The variable `i` will start at 1.
- There are no further conditions that need to be adjusted because `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, and the constraints on `t` and `speeds` are already appropriately defined for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final states before the loop starts should incorporate the starting point of `i` and ensure that `t` is at least 2, as stated. 

### Final State:
State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`, `i` is 1.**
