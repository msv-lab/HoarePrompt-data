Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is the number of elements in `speeds` (which is at least 2), `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are calculated values based on previous speeds, `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v_2`, `total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds` and the value of `total_distance` has been printed.**
