Correctness: **False**

The provided code checks whether the directed graph contains a cycle and outputs "NO" if it does, indicating that it cannot be made acyclic by removing a single edge. However, the problem description states that we are allowed to remove at most one edge to make the graph acyclic.

The code does not consider the possibility of detecting cycles that could be eliminated by removing one specific edge. For example, if the graph has complex cycles, such as a cycle comprised of multiple edges connecting various vertices, simply detecting the existence of a cycle does not guarantee that removing one edge could resolve it.

This can be illustrated with a counterexample. Consider a graph represented as follows:

```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```

In this case, there is a cycle (2 → 3 → 4 → 2). However, by removing the edge from 4 to 2, the cycle can be eliminated, making the graph acyclic. The provided code would incorrectly output "NO" because it fails to evaluate the possibility of removing one edge to break the cycle. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
