You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False


```
Original Assessment: The program is designed to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. It does this by first checking if the graph already has a cycle using depth-first search (DFS). If a cycle is detected, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, there are issues with the logic of the program:

1. The program doesn't actually check whether removing just **one edge** can prevent a cycle. Instead, it only determines if a cycle exists at all. If a cycle is found, it will always print "NO" without considering whether removing a specific edge would break that cycle.

2. The function `func_1` correctly implements cycle detection but does not provide a mechanism to test removing edges one by one from a cycle found. For the problem statement requirement of removing at most one edge to break a cycle, the program fails as it does not evaluate any specific edges for removal.

3. A potential example where the program would fail is with a simple graph like:
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   1 2
   2 3
   3 1
   ```
   In this case, the program would detect a cycle and immediately print "NO", but in reality, removing any one of the edges (for example, 3 -> 1) would break the cycle and make the graph acyclic.

Given this analysis, we see that the program does not meet the problem's requirements adequately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function 'func_1' accepts a vertex identifier 'node', a directed graph represented as a list of lists 'graph', a list 'visited' indicating which vertices have been accessed, and a list 'rec_stack' to track the vertices in the current recursion stack during depth-first search. It performs a cycle detection operation in the directed graph starting from the specified node. After execution, if the function detects a cycle that includes the node, it returns True; otherwise, it completes the traversal of reachable vertices and returns False, indicating that no cycle has been found in that part of the graph. The lists 'visited' and 'rec_stack' are modified to reflect the updated visitation and recursion state of the vertices. Given the absence of certain checks, such as for out-of-bounds indices or empty graphs, it may encounter errors or unexpected behavior under such conditions, which are not addressed in the current implementation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
