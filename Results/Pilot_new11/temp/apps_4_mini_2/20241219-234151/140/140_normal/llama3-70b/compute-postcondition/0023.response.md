Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors. If `neighbor` has not been visited and the function `func_1` returns True, then the traversal successfully visits and processes `neighbor`. Otherwise, if `neighbor` is in the recursion stack, it indicates the presence of a cycle involving `node` and `neighbor`, and the function returns True.***
