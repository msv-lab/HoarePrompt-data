To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop finish executing, we analyze the information provided and apply the logic of the loop code.

Given the initial state:
- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph,
- `graph` is a list of lists of integers representing directed edges,
- `visited` has `visited[node]` set to `True`,
- `rec_stack[node]` is set to `True`.

The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute:
- `graph[node]` must not be empty, meaning there should be at least one neighbor.

The possible conditions for each `neighbor` in the loop are:
1. If `visited[neighbor]` is `False`, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` may return either `True` or `False`, depending on whether `neighbor` leads to a cycle. 
2. If `visited[neighbor]` is `True`, then `rec_stack[neighbor]` could either be `True` (indicating a cycle) or `False` (indicating it has been visited but not in the current recursion stack).

Considering the above, if the loop completes for all neighbors without returning `True`, it indicates that all neighbors either lead to nodes already fully processed (not in the recursion stack) or nodes that have already been visited without a cycle.

After all iterations of the loop:
- If the algorithm does not find any cycles involving the `node` it started from, the output confirms that no cycles exist in the traversal starting from `node`.
- It will also indicate that all neighbors of `node` have either been visited or were already processed in previous calls.

Output State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `visited` indicates all reachable nodes from `node` that were processed, and there is no cycle detected in neighbors of `node`.**
