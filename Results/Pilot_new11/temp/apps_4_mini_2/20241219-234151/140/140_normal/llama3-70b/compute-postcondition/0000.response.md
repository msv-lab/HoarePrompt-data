The value of `visited` at the index `node` is set to `True`, indicating that the vertex represented by `node` has now been marked as visited. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a list of lists of integers representing directed edges, `visited` now has `visited[node]` set to `True`, and `rec_stack` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a list of lists of integers representing directed edges, `visited` now has `visited[node]` set to `True`, and `rec_stack` remains unchanged.**
