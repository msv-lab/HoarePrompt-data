The code assigns `True` to the index `node` in the `rec_stack` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is updated only for `rec_stack`.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a list of lists of integers representing directed edges, `visited` has `visited[node]` set to `True`, and `rec_stack[node]` is set to `True`.**
