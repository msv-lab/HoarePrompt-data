The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the variable `neighbor` to the list `queue`. The initial state mentions that `in_degree[neighbor]` has just been decreased by 1, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, then `queue` includes `neighbor`. This implies that `neighbor` is being added to `queue` because its in-degree has reached 0 after the decrement.

The state of other variables, such as `n`, `graph`, `node`, and `in_degree`, remain unchanged; however, the `queue` variable is affected by the inclusion of `neighbor`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is 0; `n` is an integer between 2 and 500; `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys; `node` is a valid key in the graph where `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor left to process; `queue` now includes `neighbor`.**
