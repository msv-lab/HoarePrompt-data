According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` contains any elements (i.e., it is not empty), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must contain at least one node whose `in_degree` is zero. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted apart from ensuring that `queue` is not empty.

State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, and `queue` must not be empty.**
