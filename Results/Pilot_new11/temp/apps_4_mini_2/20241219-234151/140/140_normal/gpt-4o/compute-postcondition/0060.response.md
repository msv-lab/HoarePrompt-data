Postcondition: ***`in_degree` has at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `neighbor` is added to `queue`, `count` is the same or increased by 1 if another neighbor was processed, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.***
