Output State: **`in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all neighbors of `node`; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys; `queue` is updated to remove the first element, reflecting the neighbors of `node` whose in-degrees were reduced to zero; `node` is set to the value of the element removed from `queue`; `count` remains unchanged.**
