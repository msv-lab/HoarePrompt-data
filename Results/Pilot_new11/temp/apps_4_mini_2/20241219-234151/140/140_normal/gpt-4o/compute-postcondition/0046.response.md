The value of `node` is assigned the result of `queue.popleft()`, which removes and returns the first element from the `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `queue` contains one less element.

Output State: **`in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `queue` contains one less element; `node` is the element that was removed from `queue`.**
