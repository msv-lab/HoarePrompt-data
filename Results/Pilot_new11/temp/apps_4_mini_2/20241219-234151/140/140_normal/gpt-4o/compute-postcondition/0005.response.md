The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, we still have all the conditions regarding `graph`, `n`, `u`, and `v` unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least one key, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the first key in the graph, `graph[u]` has at least 2 elements, `v` is the second value in `graph[u]`, and `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1.**
