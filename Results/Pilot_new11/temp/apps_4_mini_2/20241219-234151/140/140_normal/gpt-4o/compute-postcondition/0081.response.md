The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where the keys are integers representing vertices (ranging from 1 to n), and the values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices. The function also considers `n`, which is an integer representing the total number of vertices in the graph, constrained between 2 and 500. 

The output of the function indicates whether the number of nodes processed from the original queue is not equal to the integer `n`. This suggests that if the function identifies a discrepancy between the processed nodes and `n`, it indicates the presence of a cycle in the graph.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph, and returns whether there is a cycle in the graph by checking if the number of processed nodes is not equal to n.**
