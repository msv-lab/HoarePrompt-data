The statement `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since the `neighbor` remains the same and the `node` remains the same, and we know that `in_degree[neighbor]` has at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0, the state of `count` could be the same or has increased by 1 depending on whether another neighbor was processed, and `in_degree[neighbor]` was decreased by 1.

The output state remains consistent with the preconditions with the only change being that `neighbor` is now included in `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree` has at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `neighbor` remains the same; `node` remains the same; `count` is the same or increased by 1 if another neighbor was processed; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1; `queue` now includes `neighbor`.**
