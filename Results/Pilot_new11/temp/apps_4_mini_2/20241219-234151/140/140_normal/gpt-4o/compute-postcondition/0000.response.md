The `in_degree` dictionary is created using a dictionary comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Each key in this dictionary corresponds to a vertex, and its value is initialized to `0`. The variable `n` determines the number of vertices, which could be any integer in the range of 2 to 500. The state of `graph` is unchanged, and only the new `in_degree` dictionary is introduced.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to n representing vertices and values are lists of integers representing directed edges; `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 500; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` has a value of 0.**
