Postcondition: ***`in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor` added, `node` is the element that was removed from `queue`, and `count` is increased by 1, while `in_degree[neighbor]` remains 0.***
