The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it will be one unit greater than its previous state. The states of `in_degree`, `n`, `graph`, and `queue` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, `queue` is not empty, and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, `queue` is not empty, and `count` is incremented by 1.**
