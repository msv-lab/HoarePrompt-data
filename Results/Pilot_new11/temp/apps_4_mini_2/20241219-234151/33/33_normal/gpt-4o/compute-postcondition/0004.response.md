The line `t, dir = input().split()` splits the input received into two variables, `t` and `dir`. The initial state of the program indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is 0, and `valid` is True. The new values of `t` and `dir` depend on user input and cannot be pre-determined. Therefore, the output state must capture these changes while keeping the other values intact.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**
