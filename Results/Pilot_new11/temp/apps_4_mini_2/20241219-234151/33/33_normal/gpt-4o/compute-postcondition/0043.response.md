Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `n` is greater than 1. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is updated to `position - t`; if `dir` is 'South' and `position + t` exceeds 20000, `valid` is set to False; otherwise, `position` is updated to `position + t`; if `dir` is 'West' or 'East' and `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False.***
