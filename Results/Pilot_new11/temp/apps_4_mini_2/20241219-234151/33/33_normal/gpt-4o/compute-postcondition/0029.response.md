The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from the input split into two parts. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but its previous constraints of being an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `n` must be greater than 1 still apply. The exact values of `t` and `dir` are unspecified since they depend on the user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `n` must be greater than 1; `t` is a string representing the first part of the input; `dir` is a string representing the second part of the input.**
