To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop finish executing, we consider the constraints and behavior of the variables throughout the loop:

1. The variable `n` specifies the number of iterations, constrained to be between 1 and 50.
2. The variable `position` can change based on the input direction (`dir`) and time (`t`). 
3. The variable `valid` remains `True` unless certain conditions are met that invalidate it:
   - If `position` goes below 0 or above 20000.
   - If a movement is made towards an invalid direction when `position` is 0 (for 'West') or 20000 (for 'East').
   - If moving 'North' would result in a negative position, or moving 'South' would exceed 20000.

Given these conditions, at the end of the loop:
- If the loop executes `n` times and depending on each iteration's inputs of `t` and `dir`, the following must hold:
  - The final value of `position` must be within the range `[0, 20000]` for `valid` to be `True`.
  - If any iteration caused `position` to go out of bounds or triggered the valid checks related to direction, then `valid` will be `False`.

Since the loop iterates based on `n`, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the final state will reflect these evaluations. Hence:

Output State: **`position` is the final position after all steps, `valid` indicates if the moves were all within permitted limits, `n` remains the initial input integer between 1 and 50, `t_i` and `dir_i` are the inputs received during the iterations, and if any invalidation conditions were met, `valid` will be `False`.**
