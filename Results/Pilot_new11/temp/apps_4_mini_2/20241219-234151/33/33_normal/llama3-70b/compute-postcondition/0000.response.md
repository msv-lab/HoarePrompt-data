The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which accepts an integer input where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`. Other variables maintain their precondition statuses, but the specific value for `n` will now be based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each journey part, t_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and dir_i is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", or "East".**
