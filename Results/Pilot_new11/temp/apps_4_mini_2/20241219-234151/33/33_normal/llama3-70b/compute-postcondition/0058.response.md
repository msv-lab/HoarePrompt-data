The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. No variables are altered or modified before the program ends. The initial state remains unchanged, and we simply note that execution has been terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input. Program execution has terminated.**
