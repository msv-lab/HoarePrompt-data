The code provided executes a print statement but does not modify the values of any variables. The conditional logic that may change `curr_lat` based on `dir` is not executed, as it is not included in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is unchanged.**
