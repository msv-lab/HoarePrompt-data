To execute the code snippet provided, I will analyze the initial state and impacts of the operation.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string representing direction. The current value of `dir` is 'North'.

The code `curr_lat += t / 111.195` indicates that `curr_lat` will be updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The exact effect on `curr_lat` depends on the value of `t`.

Since `t` is defined as an integer, the resulting changes to `curr_lat` due to the expression `t / 111.195` will depend on whether `t` is positive, negative, or zero:

- If `t` is positive, `curr_lat` will increase.
- If `t` is zero, `curr_lat` will remain 90.
- If `t` is negative, `curr_lat` will decrease.

In conclusion, we cannot specify exactly how `curr_lat` changes without knowing the specific value of `t`. However, we know that `curr_lat` will change based on the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output state includes the variable `curr_lat`, which is updated to reflect its new value after the operation, and summarizes that no other variables have been altered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is updated to 90 + t / 111.195; `t` is an integer; `dir` is 'North'**.
