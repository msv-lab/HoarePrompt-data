According to the code, the ability to execute the loop again depends on the integer `n`, which dictates how many times the loop can run. The loop has already executed once for the current value of `n`. The current iteration of the loop is defined by an underscore (`_`), which indicates that the loop variable is not used within the body of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. Since the loop has executed once, we'll decrease the count of iterations left by one. Assuming that the loop can execute again means there are still remaining iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
