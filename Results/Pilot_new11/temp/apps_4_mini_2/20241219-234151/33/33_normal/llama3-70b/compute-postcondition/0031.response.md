The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected either. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input.**
