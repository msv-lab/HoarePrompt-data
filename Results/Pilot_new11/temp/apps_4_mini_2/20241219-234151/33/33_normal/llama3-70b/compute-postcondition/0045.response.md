The value of `t` is reassigned as an integer conversion of its previous string value. The initial state indicates that `t` is a string assigned from input. After the execution of the code, `t` will have a numerical integer value that corresponds to its previous string representation. The states of other variables (`n`, `dir`, `curr_lat`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
