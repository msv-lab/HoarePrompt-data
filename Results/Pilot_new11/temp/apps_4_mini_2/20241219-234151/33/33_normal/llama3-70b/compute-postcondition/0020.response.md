The code executes the `exit()` function, which causes the program to terminate immediately without changing any variable values. The previous conditions remain unchanged, indicating that 'NO' has been printed and the program has exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is -90; `dir` is not 'North'; 'NO' has been printed and the program has exited.**
