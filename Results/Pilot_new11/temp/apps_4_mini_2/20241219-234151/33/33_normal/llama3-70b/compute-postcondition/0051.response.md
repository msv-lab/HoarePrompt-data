The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console but does not change any of the previous states or values of the variables. Therefore, the output state will include all the previous valid information without any modifications to the values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged. The output 'NO' has been printed.**
