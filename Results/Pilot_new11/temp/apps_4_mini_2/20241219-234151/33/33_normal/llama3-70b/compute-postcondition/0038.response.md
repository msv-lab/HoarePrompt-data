The code snippet `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. As a result, none of the variable values undergo any modifications or updates, and the program ends without returning any specific values or changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; execution terminated by exit().**
