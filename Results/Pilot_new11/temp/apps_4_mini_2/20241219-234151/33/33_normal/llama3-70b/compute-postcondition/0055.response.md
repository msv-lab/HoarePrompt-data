The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of any variables. The variables that were part of the initial state remain unchanged, but the program will stop running. 

The output state will include the unchanged variables and indicate that the program execution has ended. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; program execution has ended.**
