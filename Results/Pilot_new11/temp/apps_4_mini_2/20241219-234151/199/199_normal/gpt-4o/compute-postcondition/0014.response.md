In the given code snippet, `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given that both `a` and `b` are equal to 2, we can evaluate the expression for `rem`. 

The previous values are:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 2.

Calculating the value:
- Since `a` and `b` are both 2, we have: 
  \[
  rem = n - 2 * (2 + 2) = n - 2 * 4 = n - 8
  \]

Given that `rem` was previously defined as `n - 4`, we now have an updated value for `rem` which becomes `n - 8`.

Since `n` is at least 6, the new value of `rem` is still positive because:
- If `n = 6`, then `rem = 6 - 8 = -2`, and this would violate the original condition that `rem` is greater than 0. Therefore, the minimum value for `n` must be greater than 8 for `rem` to remain positive. 

Thus, the state after the execution will reflect that `rem` is now redefined as `n - 8`, assuming that initial condition (that `rem > 0`) still holds true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is set to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8`, remaining greater than 0 and even.**
