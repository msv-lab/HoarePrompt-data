The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`, which is 2. The previous value of `b` was 1, and it is updated to 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state now reflects the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is set to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 4`, remaining greater than 0 and even.**
