In this case, `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given that `a` and `b` are both 1, we can calculate `rem` as follows: 

1. Calculate `a + b`: \(1 + 1 = 2\).
2. Multiply the result by 2: \(2 * 2 = 4\).
3. Subtract from `n`: \(n - 4\).

Thus, the value of `rem` will be `n - 4`. 

The initial values of `n`, `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions; however, `rem` is now defined as `n - 4`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 0; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.**
