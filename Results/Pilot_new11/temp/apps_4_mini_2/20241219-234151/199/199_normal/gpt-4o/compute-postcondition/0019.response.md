The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`, which is currently 3. This updates the value of `b` from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 12; `rem` is a positive even integer such that `rem` (which is equal to `n - 8`) is greater than 0, `count` is 2, `a` is 3, and `b` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 12; `rem` is a positive even integer such that `rem` (which is equal to `n - 8`) is greater than 0, `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 3.**
