The function accepts a positive integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9`. It returns `0` if `n` is less than `6`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `6`, it computes and returns the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` takes values from `1` to `n // 4`, `b` is equal to `a`, and the remainder `rem`, calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, is even and positive. The function counts valid pairs where `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If no valid pairs exist or the conditions are not met, the count will be `0`. For values of `n` from `1` to `5`, the function returns `0`, covering crucial edge cases.
