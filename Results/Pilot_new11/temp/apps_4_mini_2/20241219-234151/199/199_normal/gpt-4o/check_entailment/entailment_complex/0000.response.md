To verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description, we must analyze the provided code against the requirements.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to count the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four positive integer parts such that:
1. It is possible to form a rectangle (i.e., two pairs of equal lengths).
2. It is impossible to form a square (i.e., all four parts being of equal length).

### Key Observations:
- Each valid way to cut the stick must produce pairs of lengths: `(a, a, b, b)` where `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a != b`.
- The length must satisfy the equation `n = 2a + 2b`, or simply `n = 2(a + b)`.
- We need both `a` and `b` to be positive integers. If we denote `b = rem // 2`, we can derive conditions from here as well.
- If `n` is less than `6`, we cannot have four positive parts, thus must return `0`.

### Code Analysis:
The program processes as follows:

1. **Initial Check**: 
   - `if (n < 6): return 0` correctly excludes cases where `n` cannot yield four positive integer parts.

2. **Loop Construction**:
   - The loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. This is appropriate since `2a` must not exceed `n` for there to be a valid configuration with `b`.

3. **Calculating the Remainder**:
   - The line `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)` simplifies to `rem = n - 4a` since `b = a`.
   - To ensure that `rem` can form valid lengths, the conditions `if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` ensure that `b` can be a valid positive integer. Additionally, including the condition `if a != rem // 2` ensures that we do not count configurations that lead to a square.

4. **Counting Valid Configurations**:
   - The program counts configurations only when the conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion on Correctness:
The program correctly implements all aspects described in the problem:
- It accounts for cases where `n < 6` (returns `0`).
- It iterates through possible lengths, checks for valid conditions to form a rectangle (and not a square).
- The logic aligns with the rules laid out in the problem description.

Given these observations, we conclude that the program meets the specifications of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
