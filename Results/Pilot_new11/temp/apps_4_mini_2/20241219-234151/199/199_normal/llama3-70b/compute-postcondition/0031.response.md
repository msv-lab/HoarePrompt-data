`ways` is incremented by 1, meaning that its previous value is now 1 unit greater. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the increase in `ways` while keeping the conditions of `n`, `a`, and `b` intact.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `a` is 3, `b` is a value such that `b` is at least 4 and at most `(n - 3) // 2`, `ways` has increased by 1.**
