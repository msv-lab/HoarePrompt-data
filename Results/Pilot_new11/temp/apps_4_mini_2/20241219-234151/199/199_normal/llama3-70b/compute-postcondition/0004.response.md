The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 0, so by adding 1, the new value becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3; `ways` is 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; and `a` is not equal to `b`, and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3; `ways` is 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; and `a` is not equal to `b`, and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n.**
