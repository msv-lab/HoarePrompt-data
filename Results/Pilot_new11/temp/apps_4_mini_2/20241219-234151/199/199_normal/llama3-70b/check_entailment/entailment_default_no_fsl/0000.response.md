Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but a square cannot. The expected splits must return distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that the lengths can form a rectangle; however, the program only checks for pairs `(a, b)` where `2 * (a + b) == n`, which does not necessarily meet the conditions given in the problem description.

For example, when `n = 8`, the correct combinations should allow (2, 2, 2, 2) which can form a square, so it must be excluded. The correct valid combinations such as (1, 1, 3, 3) exist but are not accounted for due to the programâ€™s logic. 

Additionally, when checking the output hints, if `n` is less than 4, the output will always be zero, which may not align with further expected splits for certain values of `n`. In fact, the logic fails to check if n can afford splits larger than halves properly.

Thus, the program does not handle every potential case, particularly when `n` allows more configuration than the current checks permit. 

Hence, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect, and cases exist where it will fail to produce the correct outputs as specified in the problem description.
