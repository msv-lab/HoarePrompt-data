Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect comparisons of the two golden system numbers. In particular, it fails to handle leading zeros in the input strings correctly. 

For instance, consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  000
  0
  ```

In this case, both represent the same number (which is 0), but due to the way the function `func_1` operates, it will interpret "000" as having three digits with a value of 0 each time the loop runs. This will lead to the same decimal value, but if the second number was just "0" (or further cases like "001" vs "1"), it could still introduce complications in counting the values.

A more complex case may arise such as:
- Input:
  ```
  00001
  1
  ```

Here the correct output should be "=" as both represent the same value in the golden system. However, if not properly handled, the function could misinterpret the contributions of the leading zeros and compare incorrectly.

Thus, since the function does not properly account for leading zeros and their effect on the value representation in the golden base, the program's logic leads to the potential for incorrect comparisons.
