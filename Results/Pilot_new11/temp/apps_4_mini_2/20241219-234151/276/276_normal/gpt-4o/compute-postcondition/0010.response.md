According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 2. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time.

For the loop to execute another time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. As the loop iterates again, it will check the condition of `i < n`. 

At this state, `i` reaches the value of 2, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1'; `q` is approximately 1.618033988; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2**
