#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting solely of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000 characters.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1'; `q` is approximately 1.618033988; `value` is determined by the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]` (if both are '1', then `value` is approximately `2.618033988`, if `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '0', then `value` is approximately `1.618033988`, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', then `value` is `1`, and if both are '0', then `value` stays `0`); `n` is 2.
    return value
    #The program returns the value determined by the values of s[0] and s[1], which are '0' and '1' respectively, resulting in value being 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `s` containing two binary strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates a weighted sum based on the positions of '1's in the concatenated binary strings. The weight increases as the index of '1' decreases (using the golden ratio as the base of the exponentiation). The function returns a `float` value computed from the positions of '1's in the input strings. Specifically, if both strings are '0', the returned value is `0`; if one is '1' and the other is '0', the returned value will either be close to `1.618033988` or `1`, and if both strings are '1', the return value will be approximately `2.618033988`. The implementation does not include any validation for the input tuple or its contents and assumes that the strings are properly formatted as per the initial condition.
