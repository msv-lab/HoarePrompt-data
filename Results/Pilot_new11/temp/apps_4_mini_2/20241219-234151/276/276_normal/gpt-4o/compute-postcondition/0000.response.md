The variable `q` is assigned the value of the expression \((5^{0.5} + 1) / 2\). This results in a specific value for `q` since the calculation can be done directly. The values of the tuple `s` remain unchanged, as `q` is the only variable being updated. 

Calculating \(5^{0.5}\) results in \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236067977\), so the entire expression evaluates to approximately \(3.236067977 / 2 \approx 1.618033988\). 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `q`.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1', `q` is approximately 1.618033988**
