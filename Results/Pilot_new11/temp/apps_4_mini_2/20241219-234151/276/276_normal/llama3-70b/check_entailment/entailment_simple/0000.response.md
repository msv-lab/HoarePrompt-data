Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program receives two non-empty binary strings ('0's and '1's) as input. The prompt assures that inputs will be valid, which aligns with the expectation in the problem description that each input line consists of a valid binary string.

2. **Conversion to Decimal Value**: The `func_1` function takes a string (single binary number) and computes its value in the golden system using the formula given in the problem description. It properly utilizes the mathematical constant \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) and calculates the sum \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \) correctly through a loop that processes the binary digits.

3. **Comparison of Values**: After obtaining the decimal values of both input numbers, the program compares these values using standard comparison operators. It correctly prints `>` for the first number being larger, `<` for the first number being smaller, and `=` for equality, fulfilling the output requirements.

4. **Efficiency**: Given the input constraints (length of strings does not exceed 100,000), the computation performed by the function is efficient and should handle the upper limits of input size without issues. Since Python supports large floating-point numbers, it can handle the calculations necessary for the given range.

Thus, there are no conditions or edge cases based on the problem description that the program does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program meets all requirements set forth in the problem description, confirming that it is implemented correctly.
