The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where the input will be two integers separated by a space. Since the precondition states that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, after the execution of the code, `a` and `b` will contain the values specified by the user input which must still satisfy the condition that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `b` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10**
