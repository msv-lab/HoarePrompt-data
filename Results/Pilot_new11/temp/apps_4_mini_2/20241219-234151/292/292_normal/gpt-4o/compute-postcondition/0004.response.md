The variable `b` is modified by multiplying it by 2. Since `b` is initially an integer satisfying the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the new value of `b` will range from `2` to `20` (i.e., the maximum value of `b` can be 10 multiplied by 2). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State retains the initial conditions for `a` and `years` but updates the value of `b` to `b * 2`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 30; `b` is an input integer satisfying 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 20; `years` is 0**.
