To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute again, we analyze the condition `a <= b` in the context of the provided state:

- At the end of the last iteration, we know `a` is a value between 3 and 90. This means that `a` can take any value from 4 to 90 inclusive, or 3. 
- `b` is at least `2 * a`. Therefore, if `a` is 3, `b` must be at least 6. If `a` is at its maximum value of 90, then `b` is at least 180.

Given that the loop needs `a` to be less than or equal to `b` for it to continue executing, we can infer:

1. Since `b` is defined as at least `2 * a`, `b` is always greater than or equal to `a` for any valid value of `a` within the specified range (3 to 90).
2. However, to ensure that the loop has the potential to execute again in the next iteration, we have to make sure that `a` does not reach or exceed the upper limit of `b`. This can be achieved by adjusting `b` to be more than the current value of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, since `years` does not influence our condition here, we primarily need to assure that after the last iteration, there exists a situation where `a` (if it were to increase by an internal increment during the loop) remains less than `b`.

Given the state `a` as a value between 3 and 90 and knowing `b` is always set to be `2 * a`, it ensures that as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can continue running.

### Adjustments Required 
Thus, the only adjustment needed is to recognize that while `b` is already established to be at least `2 * a`, we must ensure that `a` is at a certain value relative to `b` for future iterations:
- We can simply state that `b` must be adjusted to ensure that `a` remains less than or equal to it after adjustment (particularly since `b` must be a minimum of `2 * a`).

Therefore, we're prepared to conclude:

State: **`a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is at least `2 * a` and `b` must remain greater than or equal to `a` for the loop to execute one more time**
