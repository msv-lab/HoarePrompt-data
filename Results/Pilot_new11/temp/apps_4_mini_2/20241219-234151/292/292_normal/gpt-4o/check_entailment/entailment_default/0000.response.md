The provided Python function seems to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The function takes two integers, `a` (weight of Limak) and `b` (weight of Bob), and initializes a counter for the number of years. It enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled, while Bob's weight is doubled, and the year counter is incremented. Finally, the function prints the number of years it took for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's.

The output hints confirm that the function computes the number of years until Limak becomes strictly heavier than Bob. Moreover, the examples provided in the problem description align with the logic in the code, indicating that it should work for all specified cases. The specific behavior of the program when Limak's weight starts equal to Bob's (i.e., `a = 1`, `b = 1`) demonstrates that Limak will surpass his brother in the first year, which is correct according to the problem requirements.

Thus, after analyzing the code and the description, the function correctly adheres to the problem constraints and requirements in every case. 

Correctness: **True**.
