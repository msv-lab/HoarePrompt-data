Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement, accurately simulating the weight growth of Limak and Bob by tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year. The while loop checks if Limak's weight is still less than or equal to Bob's, ensuring that it continues until Limak becomes strictly heavier than Bob. The output hints clarify that the function adheres to the constraints provided (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and performs the necessary calculations within those bounds. 

The original assessment articulates this correctness well, as the program has been tested against the sample cases and behaves as expected. It meets the requirements laid out in the problem description, and there are no discrepancies highlighted in the output hints that would indicate a failure in functionality within the defined constraints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment as accurate is warranted, resulting in the final decision of correctness.
