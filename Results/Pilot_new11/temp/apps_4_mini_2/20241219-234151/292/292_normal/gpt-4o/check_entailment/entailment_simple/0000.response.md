To evaluate the given Python program against the problem description, we can analyze the key aspects of both.

### Problem Description Recap
1. The function should read two integers, `a` (weight of Limak) and `b` (weight of Bob), with the constraint that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`.
2. Limak's weight triples every year (`a *= 3`), while Bob's weight doubles every year (`b *= 2`).
3. The goal is to determine after how many full years Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `while a <= b` continues until Limak's weight `a` exceeds Bob's weight `b`.
3. **Weight Update**: Each iteration correctly updates Limak's weight to triple (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight to double (`b *= 2`).
4. **Counting Years**: The program maintains a counter `years` that increments each time through the loop, which correctly counts the number of years until Limak is strictly heavier than Bob.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of years, which fulfills the output requirement.

### Example Checks
- For an input of `(4, 7)`:
    - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14 (not greater)
    - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 (now Limak > Bob). Output should be `2`.
- For an input of `(4, 9)`:
    - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 (not greater)
    - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 (not greater)
    - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 (now Limak > Bob). Output should be `3`.
- For an input of `(1, 1)`:
    - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 (now Limak > Bob). Output should be `1`.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine how many years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob based on the specified weight changing rules.

Correctness: **True** 

The program adheres to the problem description, transforming the weights accurately and counting the years until the condition is met, regardless of the initial weights within the given constraints.
