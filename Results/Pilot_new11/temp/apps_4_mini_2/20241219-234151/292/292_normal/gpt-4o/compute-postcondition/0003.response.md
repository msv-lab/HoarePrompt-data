After executing the code, `a` is multiplied by 3. The previous value of `a` is an input integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be within the range 3 ≤ `a` ≤ 30, and `b` remains unchanged. The value of `years` is unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 30; `b` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `years` is 0**
