The values of `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on user input, where both `a` and `b` should remain integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. The previous values of `a` and `b` are now overwritten with the new integer values from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `b` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `b` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10.**
