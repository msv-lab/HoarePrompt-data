The variable `years` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `2` to `3`. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. The specific values are as follows: `a` is `3 * (3 * a)`, which remains unchanged, and `b` is `at least 6 * a`, also remaining unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`a` is now `3 * (3 * a)`, `b` is at least `6 * a`, `years` is 3**
