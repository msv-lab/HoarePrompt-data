The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers representing the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the scoop-net within the pond. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers that represent the dimensions of the pond, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000. The parameter `r` is an integer representing the size of the scoop-net, constrained by 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m). The function returns the area of the scoop-net in the pond, which is calculated based on the positions and dimensions provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y for the coordinates of the scoop-net, n and m for the pond dimensions, and r for the scoop-net size, returning the area of the scoop-net calculated based on these values.**
