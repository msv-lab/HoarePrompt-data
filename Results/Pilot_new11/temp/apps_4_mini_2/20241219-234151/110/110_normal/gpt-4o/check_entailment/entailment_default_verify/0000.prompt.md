You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We need to position `k` fishes into an `n x m` pond in such a way that when a scoop of size `r x r` is thrown randomly, the expected number of fishes caught is maximized.
2. The scoop can be positioned in `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` possible ways.
3. The output must be accurate to within an absolute or relative error of `10^(-9)` compared to the expected value.

### Program Analysis
- The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `coverage`.
- `func_1` computes the maximum expected number of fishes that can be caught based on their positioning using a max-heap to prioritize positions with the highest coverage.
- `coverage(x, y)` computes how many scoop positions can cover the position `(x, y)` based on the boundaries set by the pond and the size of the scoop.

### Potential Issues
1. **Coverage Calculation**: The calculation of coverage in `coverage(x, y)` has a flaw. The boundaries being computed for the scoop might not reflect the actual setting of the fishes, especially at the edges of the pond. The logic used for the min and max calculations seems off because the formula does not correctly encapsulate how to count the cells that a scoop can cover.
  
2. **Looping Through Grid Points**: The loop that iterates through every cell `(x, y)` for the heap could be inefficient, particularly when `n` and `m` are large, leading to performance issues, though this does not impact correctness directly.

3. **Heap Operations**: If `k` exceeds the number of positions that can be covered by the area defined by `r`, it could lead to taking more than the available positions which could skew the expected number.

### Identifying a Case for Incorrectness
Consider the case where:
- `n = 3, m = 3, r = 3, k = 1`
In this case:
- The entire pond is covered by the scoop if it starts in the only position `(0, 0)`.
- While one fish can be placed anywhere, the calculation might not define the average number of fishes caught accurately based on the boundary conditions in `coverage`.

If the `coverage` function does not give the correct number of valid positions, then the expected output could be incorrect as indicated by the formula used.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The coverage calculation used in the `coverage` function is flawed, leading to incorrect assessments of how many fishes can be caught based on their positions in varying pond dimensions and scoop sizes. This flaw means the program can return an incorrect expected value when compared to valid configurations within the pond.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `coverage` calculates the area of a scoop-net based on its coordinates `(x, y)` within a rectangular pond defined by dimensions `(n, m)`, and a size parameter `r`. It computes how much of the scoop-net fits within the boundaries of the pond, ensuring that it does not exceed the pond's dimensions. The function calculates this by determining the effective width and height that the scoop-net can occupy given the parameters, and returns the product of these dimensions. If the scoop-net is completely out of bounds, it could potentially return a negative or zero area due to the calculation method, indicating an edge case where the scoop-net does not fit at all. Overall, it assumes the parameters `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined globally or are present elsewhere in the code, as they are not passed as arguments and their states are essential for the calculation.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
