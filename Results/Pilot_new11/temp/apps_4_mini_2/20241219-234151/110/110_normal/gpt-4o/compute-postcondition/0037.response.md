`total_positions` is assigned the value of `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. Given that `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers, the calculation will determine the number of possible positions based on the given values of these variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m - 3 * k` elements, `total_coverage` is equal to `-sum of the first k cov values, and `total_positions` is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m - 3 * k` elements, `total_coverage` is equal to `-sum of the first k cov values, and `total_positions` is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**.
