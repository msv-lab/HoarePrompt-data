The variable `total_coverage` is decremented by the value of `cov`. The previous value of `total_coverage` is 0, and `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `total_coverage` becomes `0 - cov`, resulting in a negative value. The other variables remain unchanged as their values were not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m - 1` elements, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap, `total_coverage` is equal to `-cov`.**
