The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it works with the integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. The specified constraints ensure that `n` and `m` are integers within the range of 1 to 100,000, `r` is an integer between 1 and the minimum of `n` and `m`, and `k` is an integer between 1 and the minimum of `n * m` and 100,000. 

While the output details are not specified, understanding the role of these integers in a function that processes them is essential. Assuming the function involves logic based on these constraints, the output could potentially be focused on results derived from the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

However, without further context on the output, we will simply articulate the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` within specified ranges and processes them to produce an output according to its internal logic.**
