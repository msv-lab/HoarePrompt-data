The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are assigned based on the input provided via `input().split()`, which is then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. As a result, the original values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are updated based on the user's input. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `r` is the third input integer, `k` is the fourth input integer**
