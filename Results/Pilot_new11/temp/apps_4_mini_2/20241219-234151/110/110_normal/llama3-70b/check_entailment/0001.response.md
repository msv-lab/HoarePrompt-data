To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and calculations within the code.

```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n`: Number of rows in the pond.
   - `m`: Number of columns in the pond.
   - `r`: Size of the scoop (it is a square r x r).
   - `k`: Number of fishes to be placed.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - The program calculates the number of positions where the scoop can be placed, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This gives all possible top-left corners for the scoop.
   - `ans` takes the minimum of `k` and the number of scoop positions. This would represent the maximum number of fishes that can be effectively caught in any single scoop position given what the scoop can encompass versus how many fishes are placed.

3. **Expected Number of Caught Fishes:**
   - The number of fishes that can be caught with equal probability across all valid positions of the scoop is then output as `ans` divided by the number of possible scoop positions.

### Issues with the Code:
- The logic does not correctly place the fishes in a manner to maximize the expectation of being caught, which is the main requirement of the problem. It merely divides the number of fishes that can be present within the scoop by the total number of positions without ensuring those fishes are optimally placed.
- For example, consider the input `1 1 1 1`. The scoop can only be placed once and will always catch the fish. The output should be `1.0000000000`, but the program currently outputs `1.0000000000`, which is correct. However, as soon as the problem gets larger (e.g., `5 5 1 25`), the output may not align with an optimal placement effort.
  
### Test Input for Misalignment:
Letâ€™s consider a case where n=5, m=5, r=2, and k=8 (fishes placed).
```plaintext
Input: 5 5 2 8 
```
- The expected maximum number of fish caught when the scoop is used randomly could very likely be higher than the logic implemented (places fished out diluted across areas).
- The calculation does not provide optimal coverage and works with a too simplistic approach, leading to incorrect expectations.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not optimize the placement of fishes according to the conditions of the problem, and can thus yield incorrect results in various scenarios, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
