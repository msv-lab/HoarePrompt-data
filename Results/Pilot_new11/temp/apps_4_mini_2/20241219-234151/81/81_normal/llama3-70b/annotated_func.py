#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, where the loop executes until `b` becomes 0, and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which must be greater than or equal to 1. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, where it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` reaches 0. At the conclusion of the function, `a` holds the GCD, and `b` is guaranteed to be 0. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are less than 1, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, since the function does not check for inputs of `0`, it assumes the inputs will always meet the precondition of being at least 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b), where a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers greater than or equal to 1. It calculates the result of `a` multiplied by `b`, and then divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function returns this final value. The returned value will depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided, and could introduce edge cases related to its return value, such as division by zero if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0. Hence, the function's final output depends on both the inputs `a` and `b`, and the behavior of `func_1`.
