The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers and are greater than or equal to 1. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Since it specifically states that `b` is considered to be 0 in the context of computing the GCD, the function will return the GCD only when the original values of `a` and `b` are both at least 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, both integers greater than or equal to 1, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).**
