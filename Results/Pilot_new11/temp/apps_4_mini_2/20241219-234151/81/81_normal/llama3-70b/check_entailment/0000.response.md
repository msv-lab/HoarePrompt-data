To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code carefully.

The problem involves finding "good" pairs of integers (a, b) such that:
1. GCD(a, b) = x
2. LCM(a, b) = y
3. l ≤ a, b ≤ r

From the problem, we can derive that for pairs (a, b) to be good:
- The relationship between GCD and LCM gives us the equation: GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Hence, x * y = a * b.
- Since x divides y, we can consider the candidates for (a, b) as multiples of x. Specifically, we can rewrite the candidate pairs as:
  - Let a = k1 * x
  - Let b = k2 * x
- So the equation becomes: x * y = (k1 * x) * (k2 * x) => k1 * k2 = y / x
- Therefore, both k1 and k2 must be such that \( l/x ≤ k1, k2 ≤ r/x \).

Now let's evaluate the provided code and see if it addresses this properly.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the GCD of two numbers, which will be used to verify the GCD condition.
2. **Function `func_2`**: Computes the LCM of two numbers.
3. **Missing Logic**: The provided program lacks any mechanism to actually calculate all pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r] that satisfy the conditions for x and y. There is no implementation that counts these pairs, and thus it cannot provide any output related to the counting of pairs.

### Example Potential Cases that Reveal Failure
- If we take `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 1`, and `y = 10`, the valid pairs would involve checking conditions that the code does not handle. Specifically, while the code can compute GCD and LCM, it does not generate or check pairs of integers (a, b) from the specified range.

### Conclusion
Since the code does not correctly implement the necessary logic to find and count the valid pairs based on the input constraints of the problem description, it fails to meet the provided requirements entirely.

Correctness: **False**.
