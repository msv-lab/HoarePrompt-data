The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, it returns the result of the operation \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{func\_1}(a, b)} \), where `func_1(a, b)` is called within the operation. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and return the result of \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{func\_1}(a, b)} \).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, both integers greater than or equal to 1, and returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b).**
