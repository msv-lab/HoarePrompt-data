Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers greater than or equal to 1. It calculates the result of `a` multiplied by `b`, and then divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function returns this final value. The returned value will depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided, and could introduce edge cases related to its return value, such as division by zero if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0. Hence, the function's final output depends on both the inputs `a` and `b`, and the behavior of `func_1`.**
