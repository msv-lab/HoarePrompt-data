The statement `a, b = b, a % b` assigns the value of `b` to `a`, and assigns the value of `a % b` to `b`. Given the initial state of `a` as `b_original`, and `b` as `a_original % b_original`, we evaluate the result.

1. The new value of `a` will be `b`, which is `a_original % b_original`.
2. The new value of `b` will be `a % b`, which, since `a` has been updated to `b_original`, becomes `b_original % b`.

Here, since `a_original` is not a multiple of `b_original`, `b` will not be `0`, and `a_original % b_original` is defined.

Therefore, the output state becomes:
- `a` is now `a_original % b_original`.
- `b` is now `b_original % (a_original % b_original)`.

Output State: **`a` is `a_original % b_original`, `b` is `b_original % (a_original % b_original)`, where `a_original` must not be a multiple of `b_original`.**
