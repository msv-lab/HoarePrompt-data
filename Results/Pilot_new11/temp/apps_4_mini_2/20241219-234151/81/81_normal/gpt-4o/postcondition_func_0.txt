The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, with constraints that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9. It first checks if `y` is a multiple of `x`, returning 0 if it is not, indicating the absence of valid pairs. If `y` is a multiple of `x`, it computes `z` as the integer division of `y` by `x`, representing the scaling factor. The function then iterates to find divisors of `z`, constructing potential pairs `(a, b)` based on these divisors scaled by `x`. The function counts valid pairs that satisfy specified conditions regarding their range, greatest common divisor (gcd), and product. After completing the search, it returns the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`, which can be 0 if no pairs meet the criteria or a positive integer representing the number of such pairs. Edge cases include scenarios when `y` is not a multiple of `x` or when no valid pairs are found during iteration, with the final state reflecting either a pair count or zero based on these conditions.
