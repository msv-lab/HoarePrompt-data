You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code against possible edge cases and requirements specified in the description.

The key elements of the problem description are:
1. **Determine valid pairs (a, b)** such that the GCD of (a, b) is `x` and the LCM of (a, b) is `y`.
2. Both `a` and `b` must be between `l` and `r`, inclusive.
3. The pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered distinct unless a equals b.

Now, let’s break down the code:

1. The program first checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If not, it correctly returns `0`, as it's impossible for pairs (a, b) to have the given GCD and LCM.
  
2. The variable `z` is computed as `y // x`, and then the function iterates over possible values for one component of the pair `(a, b)` based on divisors of `z`.

3. For each divisor `i`, the potential values of `a` and `b` are computed as:
   - `a = i * x`
   - `b = (z // i) * x`

4. The code then checks if both `a` and `b` fall within the specified range `[l, r]`.

5. Additionally, the GCD and LCM checks are accurately preserved:
   - GCD check: `math.gcd(a, b) == x`
   - LCM check (derived from GCD): `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`

6. The counting mechanism ensures that if `a` equals `b`, it counts once, otherwise it counts twice for distinct pairs.

Now, let's consider edge cases:
- **Case where `x` and `y` are equal**: This implies that the only valid pair would be `(x, x)`, which must be checked if it falls within `[l, r]`. However, if `x` does not lie within this range, it would produce an incorrect result.
  
- **Case where `l = 1, r = 10^9**: A stress test for the range and might produce output that should be explicitly checked against the constraints.
  
- **Case where `y < x` which cannot occur due to `1 ≤ x ≤ y`**: A theoretical validity would imply the code handles inputs that shouldn't logically exist.

However, crucially, checking with valid inputs and confirming the outputs against the problem description becomes essential, particularly the checks on the defined pairs. 

A specific potential failure case can be constructed:
- For input `(1, 10, 4, 4)`, the program should yield `1`, which represents the valid pair `(4, 4)`. In contrast, my initial instinct indicates the way pairs are summed could misconstrue simple input assessments involving single number pairs returning greater counts.
  
In another edge case `(1, 5, 1, 5)`, the valid pairs would yield checks while doubling on `(1, 5)` and `(5, 1)` potentially going unnoticed.

However, upon aggregated consideration of different cases:
After scrutinizing the mechanics, no evident failure point could be managed without contravening the logical flow laid in the problem description.

Thus, since I cannot find a specific failing input case that the code does not handle correctly against the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if (y % x != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9. The value of `y` is a multiple of `x` (i.e., `y % x = 0`).
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b
                ) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `count` is equal to the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found in the loop, retaining `z` equal to `y // x`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of valid pairs (a, b) found in the loop, denoted by 'count'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
