To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the described problem, let's analyze the implementation of `func_1`.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function is required to find the number of "good" pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that:
1. \( l \leq a, b \leq r \)
2. \( GCD(a, b) = x \)
3. \( LCM(a, b) = y \)
4. \( y \) must be a multiple of \( x \) (i.e., \( y \% x = 0 \)).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers \( l, r, x, y \).

2. **Condition Check**: 
   ```python
   if (y % x != 0):
       return 0
   ```
   This check is necessary because if \( y \) is not a multiple of \( x \), it's impossible for there to be any good pairs since \( LCM(a, b) \) must be greater than or equal to \( GCD(a, b) \) and a multiple of it.

3. **Calculating Pairs**:
   - The variable \( z \) is calculated as \( z = y // x \).
   - The program iterates through all divisors of \( z \) using `range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1)` to find pairs \( (a, b) \).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - \( a = i \cdot x \)
     - \( b = (z // i) \cdot x \)

4. **Validating Pairs**:
   - It checks if \( l \leq a \leq r \) and \( l \leq b \leq r \).
   - It verifies the conditions \( GCD(a, b) = x \) and \( LCM(a, b) = y \) correctly using:
     ```python
     if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
     ```
   - If \( a \) equals \( b \), it counts one, otherwise counts both \( (a, b) \) and \( (b, a) \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the count of good pairs based on the defined rules. All conditions stipulated in the problem description are appropriately checked and handled. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the program behaves according to the requirements given.

Correctness: **True**
