Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `count` are integers. If `a` equals `b`, then `count` is increased by 1, `z` remains equal to `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` is equal to `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x` with `i` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2, `z` still equals `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` continues to be `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x`, with `i` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.***
