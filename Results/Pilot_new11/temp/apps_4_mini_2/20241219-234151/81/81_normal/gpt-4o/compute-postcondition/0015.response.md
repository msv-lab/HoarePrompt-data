Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `count`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9`, and `z` is equal to `y // x`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is set to 1, and the values satisfy the conditions that `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `count` is set to 2, and the same conditions on `a` and `b` hold, including `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` being equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor being equal to `y`.***
