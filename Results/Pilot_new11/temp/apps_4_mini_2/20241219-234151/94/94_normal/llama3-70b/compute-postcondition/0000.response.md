To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the provided pre-loop state information.

The loop iterates `i` over a range of 4, meaning it will execute 4 times, with `i` taking the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 in sequential iterations. 

The crucial factors here do not necessarily depend on conditions or values outside the iteration structure since the loop has a defined range. However, itâ€™s important to note the initial values of `i` at the beginning of the loop. 

Since we want to represent the state at the beginning of the first loop iteration:

1. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, since that's the starting value when each loop begins.
2. The other variables, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, are not directly affecting the iteration mechanics of the loop but describe the context (the 2D lists).

Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, the following adjustments or statements can be made about the state:

- The index `i` starts at 0.
- The two puzzles contain elements as stated (these statements help to contextualize but don't impact whether the loop runs or not).

Thus, the necessary states are encapsulated as follows:

State: **`puzzle1` is a 2D list representing a 2x2 grid containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `puzzle2` is a 2D list representing a 2x2 grid containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 0**
