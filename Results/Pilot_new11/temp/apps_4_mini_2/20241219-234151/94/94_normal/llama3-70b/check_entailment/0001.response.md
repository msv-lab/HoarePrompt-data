To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's consider the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and the requirements of the problem.

The problem states that Bessie and Elsie can slide tiles in their respective 2x2 puzzles and we need to determine if they can reach the same configuration.

The provided code does the following:

1. It reads the input puzzles and stores them as strings.
2. It identifies the position of the empty space ('X') in both puzzles.
3. It then attempts to "swap" the positions of the empty tiles in both puzzles, although this direct swap logic does not actually represent a valid move in the context of sliding the tiles.
4. Finally, it checks if the sorted tiles of each puzzle are the same to conclude whether they can be configured the same way.

Now, let's analyze potential edge cases that the program might not handle correctly:

- The core issue is that the program swaps the positions of the empty slots and checks if the sorted version of the puzzles are equal. However, the sorted comparison approach does not consider the actual sliding moves. For example, certain configurations may require specific sequences of moves that cannot be achieved just by sorting the tiles or swapping empty positions.

For instance, consider the following inputs, which the program would incorrectly evaluate:
```
Input for Puzzle 1:
AB
XC
Input for Puzzle 2:
AC
BX
```
In the above input, the second puzzle cannot reach the same configuration as the first one under the allowed sliding moves; however, after swapping empty spaces and sorting, the tiles appear similar, which leads to a false positive "YES".

Due to this discrepancy in logic, we can conclude that there are configurations where the answer would be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
