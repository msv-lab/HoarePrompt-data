#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are 2D lists representing 2x2 grids containing exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists representing 2x2 grids containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is the row index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the row index of 'X' in `puzzle2`. Both `x1` and `x2` will have values in the range of 0 to 1, indicating where 'X' is located in the respective grids.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted elements of `puzzle1` are equal to the sorted elements of `puzzle2`, after considering that `puzzle1` contains swapped elements of `puzzle2` at indices `x1` and `x2` (both within the range of 0 to 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2D lists, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each representing a 2x2 grid that contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. It identifies the row indices of 'X' in both puzzles, swaps the rows containing 'X' between the two puzzles, and then checks if the sorted contents of `puzzle1` are equal to the sorted contents of `puzzle2`. The function returns a boolean value indicating the equality of the sorted lists after the swap operation. It is important to note that the function assumes the input lists always contain valid elements and may not handle cases where 'X' is not present, duplicates exist, or the lists are not in 2x2 format, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.
