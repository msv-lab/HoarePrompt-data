According to the code, the loop will iterate over the `directions`, which means it will execute for each element in the `directions` list. To execute one more time, we need to look at the values of `dr` and `dc`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `start` is a string with some specific characters, and we also have the conditions for `new_row`, `new_col`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, and `new_state`. We need to adjust the state for the next iteration based on how `directions` are organized.

Since we do not know how many elements are in `directions` but can infer that the loop relies on iterating through them, we will need to increase the index or position that we are accessing in `directions`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop index moves to the next pair of `(dr, dc)`. Therefore, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', `dr` is the next direction's row change, `dc` is the next direction's column change.**
