The line of code swaps the elements at the indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The initial conditions state that `new_state` is a copy of `current` and that `empty_pos` represents the index of 'X' in `current`.

Therefore:

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` (which is the position of 'X') will now hold the value that was originally at `new_pos`.
2. `new_state[new_pos]` will now hold the value that was originally at `empty_pos`, effectively swapping the two characters.

The values of `start`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col` will not be affected by this operation, but the indices involved will change the specific characters in `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is calculated as (r + dr) * 2 + (c + dc); `new_state` reflects the swap between characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
