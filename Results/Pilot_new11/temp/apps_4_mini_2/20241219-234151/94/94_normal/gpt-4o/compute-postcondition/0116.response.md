The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', representing the initial configuration of the sliding puzzle on a 2 Ã— 2 grid. After executing the function body, the program returns the set of all unique states formed by valid sequences of swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters, as stored in 'visited'. If no valid moves were possible, 'visited' contains only the initial state `start`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept a string `start` representing a sliding puzzle arrangement and return the unique configurations that can be achieved through legal moves involving 'X'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start, representing the initial configuration of a sliding puzzle, and returns the set of all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with adjacent characters. If no valid moves are possible, it returns a set containing only the initial state.**
