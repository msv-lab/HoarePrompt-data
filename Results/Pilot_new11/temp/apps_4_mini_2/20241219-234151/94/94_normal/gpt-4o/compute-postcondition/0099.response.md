The code snippet involves adding a new string representation of a state, `new_state_str`, to a set called `visited`. This action impacts the state by including `new_state_str` into the `visited` set. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Since `visited` is a set, it will now contain the string `new_state_str`, which is derived from joining elements of a `new_state`. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from joining `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
