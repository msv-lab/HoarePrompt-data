The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. The variable `new_state` remains defined from the previous state, and `new_state_str` will represent this concatenated string resulting from the elements of `new_state`. 

The initial conditions remain intact except for the new addition of `new_state_str`. The `new_state` variable was derived from a swap operation based on the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the result of concatenating the elements of `new_state` into a single string.**
