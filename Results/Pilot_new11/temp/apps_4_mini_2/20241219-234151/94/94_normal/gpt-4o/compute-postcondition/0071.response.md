The variable `new_state` is an array of characters where the characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped. The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` converts this array back into a string format by concatenating all the characters in `new_state`. The variable `new_state_str` is now assigned the string representation of `new_state`. 

The initial state of `start` being a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X' indicates that swapping characters will still result in a string of similar character composition, as only positions change.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has the values swapped at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string formed from `new_state`.**
