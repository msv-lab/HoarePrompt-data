Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states obtained by swapping 'X' with its adjacent characters in the grid, `queue` contains the states that are reachable from `start` by valid moves. If no moves were possible, `visited` will contain only `start` and `queue` will be empty.**
