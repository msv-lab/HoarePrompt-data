In the provided code snippet, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are being swapped. 

1. `new_state` is a list of characters derived from `current`, which is not directly affected.
2. The variables `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, `dr`, and `dc` influence which elements of `new_state` are swapped. 
3. The elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state` are exchanged.

Given that `new_pos` is calculated as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, it suggests that `new_pos` is determined based on the changes represented by `dr` and `dc`. 

Since the exact values of `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide specific numerical or positional results for these variables. Still, we can indicate the presence of the swap operation and its implications.

After executing the code, the output state will indicate that `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have exchanged their values based on the swap.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` has exchanged the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
