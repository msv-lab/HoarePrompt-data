To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the provided code.

The problem requires determining if two 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through a series of moves. The moves consist of sliding a tile (either 'A', 'B', or 'C') into an adjacent empty space (labeled 'X').

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function simply concatenates the two rows of the puzzle grids into one string, which is likely meant to represent the puzzle state. However, this function is defined but never used in the code.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore all reachable states from the initial configuration given as `start`. It enqueues all unique configurations into a set called `visited`.
   - The current state is checked for possible moves based on the position of 'X' (the empty space). For each move, it generates a new state and adds it to the queue if it has not been visited.
   - The return value is the set of all visited states.

### Missing Logic

The code does not seem to provide a final comparison between Bessie's and Elsie's configurations. It prepares to explore states for one puzzle but does not include logic to apply this exploration to both puzzles and determine if they can reach the same configuration.

**Potential Case Where It Fails:**
- If we call `func_2` for both Bessie's and Elsie's configurations separately, we would miss the final step of checking if both puzzles have at least one common state in their visited states.
- This means that even if one puzzle can reach multiple configurations, if those configurations do not match the other puzzle's configurations, we cannot deduce that they can reach the same configuration. 

### Conclusion

Since the provided code does not complete the required task as per the problem description by lacking the comparison between the two configurations, it is not correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not satisfy the problem's requirements as it fails to determine whether both puzzles can reach the same configuration.
