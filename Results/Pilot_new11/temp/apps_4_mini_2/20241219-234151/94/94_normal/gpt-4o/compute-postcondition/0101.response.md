Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from joining `new_state`; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and appended to `queue`.***
