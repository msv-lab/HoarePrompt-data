The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The values of `visited` are updated to include this new string representation of the state. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the result of concatenating the elements of `new_state` into a single string; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
