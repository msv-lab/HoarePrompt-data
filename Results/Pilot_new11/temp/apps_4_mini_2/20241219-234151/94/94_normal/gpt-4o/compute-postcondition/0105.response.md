The variable `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The previous values of `new_row` and `new_col` are known because they are updated from `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. 

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are not explicitly provided with their values in the initial state, we keep them as expressions involving `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`. 

Thus, the output state can be expressed as follows:

`new_pos` is assigned the value `new_row * 2 + new_col`, where `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
