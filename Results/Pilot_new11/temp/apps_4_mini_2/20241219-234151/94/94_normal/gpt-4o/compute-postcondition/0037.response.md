Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` has elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped to create `new_state_str`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` and `queue` includes `new_state_str`. Otherwise, if `new_state_str` is already visited, there are no changes to `visited` or `queue`.***
