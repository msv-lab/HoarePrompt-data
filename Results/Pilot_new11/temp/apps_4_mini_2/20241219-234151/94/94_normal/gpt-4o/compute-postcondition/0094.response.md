The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned the values of `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not provided, but we know that `dr` and `dc` are changes in row and column. Therefore, after execution, `new_row` will be the sum of the current `empty_row` and `dr`, and `new_col` will be the sum of the current `empty_col` and `dc`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
