The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` determine the position of 'X' in a 2x2 grid based on `empty_pos`. The values of `dr` and `dc` represent the changes in the row and column indices, respectively, to calculate the new position of 'X'. 

`new_row` is then assigned the value of `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`. The states of `start`, `directions`, and `current` remain unaffected. 

Assuming the previous values are specifically:
- `empty_row` = r
- `empty_col` = c
- `dr` and `dc` are known offsets.

The new values will be:
- `new_row` = r + dr
- `new_col` = c + dc

Therefore, based on the computations:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process, `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is r, `empty_col` is c, `new_row` is r + dr, `new_col` is c + dc.**
