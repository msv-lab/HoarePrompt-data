The variable `empty_row` is assigned the value of `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` is assigned the value of `empty_pos % 2`. The variable `empty_pos` represents the index of the character 'X' in the string `start`, which has a length of 4. The `divmod` function is used to perform this division and modulo operation, effectively giving the row and column indices based on a 2x2 grid representation of the `start` string.

Given that `start` contains one 'X' and three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'}, `empty_pos` will range from 0 to 3. The value of `empty_row` will be determined by integer division of `empty_pos` by 2, and `empty_col` will be determined by the remainder when `empty_pos` is divided by 2.

The values of `directions`, `current`, and `visited` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is determined by the calculation of `empty_row` and `empty_col` based on the value of `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` contains the value of `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.**
