Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid sequences of swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` is empty as all reachable unique states from `start` have been explored; `current` is the last state processed before `queue` became empty; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which no longer changes; `empty_row` and `empty_col` represent the final coordinates of 'X' at the end of the iterations; if no valid moves were possible, `visited` will contain only `start` and `queue` will be empty.**
