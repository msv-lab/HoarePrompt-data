The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. Since `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, its inclusion will change the contents of `visited`, but the other variables remain unaffected. The initial state specifies that `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, which is not present in `visited` before this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_state`, `current`, and `visited` are updated with `new_state_str` added to `visited`.**
