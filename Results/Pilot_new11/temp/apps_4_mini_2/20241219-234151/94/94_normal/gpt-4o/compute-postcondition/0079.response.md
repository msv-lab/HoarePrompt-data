`empty_pos` is assigned the value of the index of character 'X' in the `current` string. The variable `current` is not affected; however, the value of `empty_pos` will reflect the position of 'X' within `current`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` has one less reachable unique state than it had before; `current` is the last state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
