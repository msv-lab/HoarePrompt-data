To generate `new_pos`, we consider the existing values of `new_row` and `new_col`. `new_row` is the sum of `empty_row` and `dr`, and `new_col` is the sum of `empty_col` and `dc`. Thus, the formula for `new_pos` becomes:

```
new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)
```

The impacts of this code on the program involve updating `new_pos` based on the provided calculations. Other variables, such as `start`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, are not directly changed by this line of code; they will retain their existing values. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.**
