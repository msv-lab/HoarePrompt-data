The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are computed as the sum of `empty_row` and `dr`, and `empty_col` and `dc`, respectively. The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`, which is the index of 'X' in `start`. 

Given that `empty_pos` is defined as the index of 'X', `empty_row` would be `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` would be `empty_pos % 2`. The values of `dr` and `dc` will come from the list `directions`, which consists of tuples representing directional movements.

The changes occur in the variables `new_row` and `new_col` based on the selected `dr` and `dc`. However, since `dr` and `dc` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values.

Thus, the output state will note that `new_row` and `new_col` will hold values based on the current `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the chosen direction.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` contains the value of `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**.
