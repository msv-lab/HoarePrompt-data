The function accepts a string parameter `start`, representing the initial configuration of a sliding puzzle on a 2 Ã— 2 grid, containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. It performs a breadth-first search to explore all unique states that can be reached by swapping the position of 'X' with its adjacent characters (up, down, left, right). It maintains a set called `visited` to track all unique configurations encountered during this exploration. The function ultimately returns the `visited` set, which includes all valid unique states formed by these swaps. If no valid swaps are possible, the `visited` set will only contain the original state `start`. The function does not account for scenarios where the input string is not valid or does not meet the length requirement.
