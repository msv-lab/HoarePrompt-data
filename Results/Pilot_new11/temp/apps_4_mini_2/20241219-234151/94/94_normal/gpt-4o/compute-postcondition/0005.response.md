The variable `empty_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'X' in `current`, which is equal to `start`. Since `start` is a string of length 4 containing one character 'X' and three other characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'}, `empty_pos` will be an integer representing the position of 'X' in that string. The other variables retain their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` contains the value of `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `start`.
