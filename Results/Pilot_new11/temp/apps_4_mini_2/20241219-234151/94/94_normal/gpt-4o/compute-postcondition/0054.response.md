Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited`, and `queue` now contains at least one reachable state from `start` along with `new_state_str`. `directions` is defined and contains at least one direction; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; and `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, where `new_state_str` represents the list resulting from swapping the 'X' with its adjacent character.***
