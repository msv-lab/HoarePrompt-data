The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends `new_state_str` to the existing `queue`. Since other variables are not changed by this operation, we will keep their previous states intact. The output state focuses on stating that `new_state_str` has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from joining `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.**
