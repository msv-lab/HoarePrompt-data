Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, a new state string `new_state_str` is formed by joining `new_state`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, it is added to `visited` and appended to `queue`.***
