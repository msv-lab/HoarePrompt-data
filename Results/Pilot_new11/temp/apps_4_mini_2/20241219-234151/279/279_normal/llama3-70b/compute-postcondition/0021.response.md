Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`; `ans` is the count of elements in `p` that do not match their index (i.e., `p[i] != i + 1`) plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is 0; `i` is `n - 1` after the final iteration.**
