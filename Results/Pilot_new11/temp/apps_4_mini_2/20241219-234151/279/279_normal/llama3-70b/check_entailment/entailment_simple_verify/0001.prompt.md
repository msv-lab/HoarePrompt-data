You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the described problem, we need to analyze what the program does and identify if it correctly calculates how many changes are required for the permutation `p` and the sequence `b`.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

The logic in the function:
1. It first determines the number of elements in the permutation `p` that are not in their "natural" position (i.e., `p[i] != i + 1`). This addition is done via `ans += 1`.
2. Secondly, it adds to the answer a value for each occurrence of `0` in `b` (`if b[i] == 0: ans += 1`).

However, there are significant issues with this logic:

1. The way the program checks for the incorrect positioning in `p` is not sufficient. The goal is to ensure that the permutation allows each skewer to visit all positions correctly, and merely counting how many are not in their natural position does not guarantee that. For example, if `p` represents a cycle or improperly structured pairing, that could lead to an incorrect movement that prevents achieving the required placements in `2n` moves.

2. The program doesn't consider combinations of `p` and `b` that might yield a valid configuration despite disparities in the individual elements. It fails to assess whether the direction defined by `b` appropriately complements the intended usage of `p`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input below which should return a count greater than `2`:
```
Input:
3
1 2 3
1 0 1
```
In this case:
- The permutation `p` is already correct.
- The sequence `b` indicates that only the second skewer is not being reversed, which is acceptable.

However, since the current logic simply adds `1` for not being in place and for every `0` in `b`, this results in an answer of `1 (from b1) + 0 (from b) = 1`. But logically, some elements need to be reassessed, and this simplistic counting isn't adequate to ensure both sets of conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion
Since the implemented code does not align with the requirements of the problem description and fails under certain input conditions, the correctness verdict is:

Correctness: **False** 

This program does not consider crucial interactions between `p` and `b` that may invalidate the expected outcomes. Therefore, it cannot be deemed correct overall.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and b is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with a length of n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`; `ans` is the count of elements in `p` that do not match their index (i.e., `p[i] != i + 1`) plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is 0; `i` is `n - 1` after the final iteration.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
