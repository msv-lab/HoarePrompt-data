Postcondition: ***`visited` is a list of n True values, `cycles` contains all unique cycles detected in the permutation defined by `p`, `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean conditions for all cycles in `cycles`. If `len(cycles)` is equal to 1, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `no_reverse_components` is greater than 0, the printed value is `no_reverse_components`.***
