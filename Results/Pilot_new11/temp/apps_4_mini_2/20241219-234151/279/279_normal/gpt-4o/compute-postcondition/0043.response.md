Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1. If `visited[i]` is False, `visited` is updated to mark all indices visited during the loop as True, and `cycle` will contain the values of `x` encountered throughout the iterations. On the last iteration, `x` is set to the value of `p[x] - 1`, and `cycles` will contain all previous cycles plus the current `cycle`. If `visited[i]` is True, no updates are performed.***
