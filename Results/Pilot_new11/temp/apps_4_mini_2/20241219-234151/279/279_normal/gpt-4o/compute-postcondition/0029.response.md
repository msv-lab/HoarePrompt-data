According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `visited[x]`. The loop will execute as long as `visited[x]` is `False`. Right before the loop, `x` is 1, and `visited` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `visited[1]` is `False` so that the loop can execute. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, `i` and `cycle` are not directly relevant to the loop execution condition. Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `visited[1]` must be `False`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list, visited[1] must be False**
