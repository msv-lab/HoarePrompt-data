The variable `cycle` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cycle` is an empty list**.
