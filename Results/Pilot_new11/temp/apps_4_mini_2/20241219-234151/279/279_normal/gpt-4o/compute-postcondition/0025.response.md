Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0. If `visited[i]` is False, then the sequence of indices marked as True is updated according to the values accessed through `p`, `cycle` captures all unique indices visited starting from 0 up to the first repeated index, `x` takes the value of the first index for which `visited[x]` is True, causing the loop to terminate, and `cycles` is updated to include the new `cycle`.***
