You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
    no_reverse_components = sum((all((b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)) for cycle in cycles))
    if len(cycles) == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

### Code Analysis

1. **Inputs and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` and two sequences `p` (permutation) and `b` (sequence of zeros and ones).
   - It initializes a list `visited` to track which positions have been visited while identifying cycles.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses a loop to find cycles in the permutation `p`. Each time it finds an unvisited position `i`, it traces the cycle starting from `i` and adds the cycle to the `cycles` list.

3. **Counting No-Reverse Components**:
   - After finding all the cycles, it counts how many cycles consist entirely of indices where `b` is zero.

4. **Output**:
   - If there is only one cycle, it prints `0`, implying no changes are needed.
   - If there are multiple cycles, it checks if there are cycles that have no reversing operations (i.e., all `b[x] == 0`). If there are such cycles, it prints the count. If there are no such cycles, it defaults to printing `1`.

### Problem Interpretation

Pavel requires the permutation and sequence to allow every skewer to visit each position (1 to n in both original and reversed directions) at least twice. Specifically, we need to count how many elements need to be changed to achieve this.

### Test Cases

Let's check some edge cases:

1. **Single Element Case**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     1
     1
     0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `1` (change `b[1]` to `1`).
   - The program prints `1`. This seems correct.

2. **Two Elements with Reverse**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     1 2
     0 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0` (since the cycle visits are adequate).
   - The program prints `0`. This seems correct.

3. **Three Elements with All 0s**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     2 3 1
     0 0 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `1` (any `b[i]` should be changed to `1`).
   - The program prints `1`. This seems correct.

4. **Complex Case**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     4 3 2 1
     0 1 1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2` (two need reversing).
   - The program outputs `2`, which matches the expectation.

### Checking for Missing Logic

However, we need to check for potential missing edge cases. The code simply counts cycles without detailed error handling or cases for non-cyclic permutations or permutations that do not allow for complete reversibility based on `b`.

**Potential Case Not Handled**:
- If we have a permutation like:
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 5 4
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
  Even though all positions might have 1s, the cycles must also be completely reversible paths, meaning the checks against having cycles with only 0s aren't sufficient. The logic fails to ensure that the permutation structure allows reversibility based on inputs fully.

### Conclusion

Since there can be scenarios where all skewers cannot visit either all positions or have incomplete reversibility based on `p` and `b`, it appears there are cases unaccounted for in the logic provided. Thus, the code could produce incorrect results for some permutations and sequences.

Correctness: **False**


Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a permutation of integers `p` from 1 to `n` and a corresponding list `b` of zeros and ones. It identifies cycles in the permutation, determining how many of these cycles consist entirely of indices with a value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one unique cycle across the entire permutation, it prints `0`. If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of cycles that do not have any indices marked with `1` in the `b` list, unless this count is zero, in which case it prints `1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints results based on the cycle analysis. The input constraints and potential edge cases, such as handling all `1`s or mixed values in `b`, are considered, ensuring the function is robust for the specified input limits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
