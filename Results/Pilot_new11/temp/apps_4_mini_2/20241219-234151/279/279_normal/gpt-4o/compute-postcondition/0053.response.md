The value of `cycle` is updated by appending `x` to the existing list, which was initially `[2]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `cycle` will become `[2, x]`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `visited[x]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cycle` is [2, x], `visited[x]` is True**
