The code initializes an empty list `cycle`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and the value of `visited[i]` is not True; `cycle` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, the value of `visited[i]` is not True, `cycle` is an empty list**.
