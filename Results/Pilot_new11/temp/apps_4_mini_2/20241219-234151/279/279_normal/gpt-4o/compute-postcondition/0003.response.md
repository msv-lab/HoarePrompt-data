The variable `p` is assigned the value obtained by mapping the integers in `data[1:n + 1]` to `int`. Since `data` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the input string and `n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` will now contain a list of integers consisting of the elements from `data[1]` to `data[n]`. The states of the other variables `n`, `b`, and `data` are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n, `data` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the input string, and `p` is a list of integers obtained from the integer conversion of the elements from `data[1]` to `data[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n; `data` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the input string; `p` is a list of integers composed of `int(data[1])`, `int(data[2])`, ..., `int(data[n])`.**
