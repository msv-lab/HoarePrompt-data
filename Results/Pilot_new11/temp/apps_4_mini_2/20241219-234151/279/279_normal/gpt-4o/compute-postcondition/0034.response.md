The code assigns `True` to `visited[x]`. Since `visited[1]` is already `True`, the state of `visited` is updated such that `visited[x] = True`, where `x` is defined properly such that `visited[x]` was previously `False`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing the value of `x`, `visited[1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True**.
