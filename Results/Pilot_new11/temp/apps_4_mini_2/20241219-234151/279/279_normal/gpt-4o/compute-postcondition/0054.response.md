To analyze the code snippet, we first identify that `x` is updated to be `p[x] - 1`. The initial state specifies that `visited[x]` is `True`, but `p[x]` is not specified. However, given the context that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is starting at 2, we focus on how this operation affects `x`.

The variable `x` will be assigned the value `p[x] - 1`, which means `x` will change based on its previous value in the `p` list or array.

Since we don't know the current value of `p[x]`, we cannot determine a specific new value for `x`. We can only express that `x` is updated based on `p[x]`.

Given that `n` remains unchanged (n is still a positive integer greater than 2), `i` also remains unchanged (still 2), and the list `cycle` remains [2, x] but with the updated value of `x`, the significant change that we can note is in `x`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `cycle` is [2, p[x] - 1]; `visited[x]` is True**.
