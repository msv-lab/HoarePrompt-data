The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Since `cycle` initially contains two occurrences of `x`, after the operation, it will contain three occurrences of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing three occurrences of `x`, `visited[1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True and `visited[x]` remains True.**
