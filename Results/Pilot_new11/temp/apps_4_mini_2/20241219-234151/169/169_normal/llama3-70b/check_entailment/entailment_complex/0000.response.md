The provided program defines a function that processes a sequence of operations represented as a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, which corresponds to adding and removing stones from a pile. The goal is to determine the minimal number of stones that can remain after performing all operations, given that the pile starts non-empty.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description:

1. **Count of Operations**: The function correctly counts occurrences of "-" and "+" characters in the string `s`. This matches the requirement to know how many stones were added and removed.

2. **Condition Evaluation**: The function checks if the count of "-" (which means stones were taken) is greater than the count of "+" (stones added). This is a crucial check because if there are more removals than additions, Vasya could not have started with fewer stones than required to fulfill the removals. Thus, if the removals exceed the additions, it is correct to output 0.

3. **Correct Output Calculation**: If the removals do not exceed the additions, it calculates the difference (`plus_count - minus_count`) as the output. This represents the net gain of stones after performing the operations, which is also correct because it accounts for the initial scenario where we can assume that Vasya started with enough stones to withstand the removals.

4. **Output Handling**: The function prints the result directly, as required by the problem description.

Considering these points, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all potential valid scenarios provided by the input constraints, including edge cases with maximal and minimal counts of operations.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
