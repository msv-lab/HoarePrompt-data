Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimal possible number of stones after performing the specified operations. As indicated in the assessment, the program fails in scenarios where the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations. The program's logic incorrectly asserts that if there are more "-" than "+", the output should be 0, without fully accounting for the requirement that there must be enough stones to perform each operation.

For example, with an input of `3` and the string `"-++"`, the program will output 1, due to its calculation of `plus_count - minus_count` being `2 - 1` which is not correct. The correct output should consider the implications of starting with stones: if there is a sequence of operations starting with zero stones that would necessitate a requirement for more stones than what is accounted for in a simplistic count of operations. Therefore, the program's logic leads to incorrect results in some cases, supporting the original assessment of correctness as **False**.
