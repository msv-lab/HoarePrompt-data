The code assigns `stones` the value of `max(0, stones - 1)`. Since the initial value of `stones` is `0`, we compute the expression:

- `stones - 1` results in `0 - 1`, which equals `-1`.
- `max(0, -1)` yields `0` because it is the greater of the two values.

Thus, the value of `stones` remains `0`. The state of the other variables stays the same, as they are unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+', `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in `s`, `operation` is equal to '-'**.
