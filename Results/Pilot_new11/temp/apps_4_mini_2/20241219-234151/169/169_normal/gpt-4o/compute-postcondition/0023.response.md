The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, where each character is either `'-'` or `'+'`. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the characters in the string `s`. 

Although the specific output behavior is not provided, we can summarize the expected use case based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `'-'` and `'+'` characters, and it returns a result based on the evaluation of these characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string s consisting of n characters, each being '-' or '+', and returns a result based on the evaluation of the string.**
