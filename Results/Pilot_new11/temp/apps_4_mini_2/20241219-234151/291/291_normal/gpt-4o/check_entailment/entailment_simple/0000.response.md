To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the problem statement and the program's logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
Sofia needs to draw `n` squares in a specific way. Each square requires 4 segments. However, since segments can rely on previously drawn segments, we want to minimize the number of segments she draws with a ruler (without a guide). 

The first square will require 2 segments drawn with a ruler; after that, she can use the segments drawn for the first square as guides for additional squares. The following explains how to compute the minimum segments required based on `n` squares logically. The goal is to find a way to compute how many segments are needed without guides based on how squares are arranged.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program uses a square root approach to determine possible dimensions `(a, b)` that could form the squares when arranged in some rectangle.
2. For each dimension of rectangles `(a, b)`, it computes the total segments needed to draw `n` squares.
3. The formula used in the code: `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)` calculates the total segments drawn based on the perimeter of the rectangle made by these segments.
4. The program then keeps track of the minimum found for these segments through the loop iterating from `1` to `sqrt(n)`.

### Specific Points:
- The formula `b = (n + a - 1) // a` is a way to compute how many rows of squares are needed if vertical sections are considered as having width varying by rectangle width, minimizing how she needs to draw.
- The return value is the minimum segments derived from all possible combinations where `a` runs from `1` to `sqrt(n)`.

### Verification of Correctness:
1. For `n = 1`, the program gives `2`, which is correct.
2. For `n = 2`, it gives `3`, which is correct.
3. For `n = 4`, it provides `4`, which aligns again.
4. For larger `n`, it finds the smallest perimeter based on derived rectangle area formulations.

### Final Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler, adhering to the problem description and constraints provided. 

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements detailed in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
