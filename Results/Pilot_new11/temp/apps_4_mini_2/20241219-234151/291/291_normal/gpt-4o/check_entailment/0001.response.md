Correctness: **True**

The program correctly computes the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler for given squares, according to the description provided in the problem. 

### Explanation:
1. Sofia needs `n` squares, and each square requires 4 segments. To minimize the number of segments drawn without a guide, the algorithm computes the dimensions of a rectangle (a, b) such that `a * b >= n`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle formed by the squares.
2. The program iterates over potential values of `a`, calculates `b`, and uses these values to compute the total number of segments needed. The total segments required is calculated as `2 * (a + b)`.
3. It keeps track of the minimum number of segments across all potential rectangles defined by values of `a` and corresponding `b`.

### Edge Case Handling:
- The input constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) are handled because the loop runs only until the square root of `n`, making it efficient for large inputs.
- The program correctly handles the condition for achieving `n` squares by ensuring that `a * b` is at least `n`.
  
Since the strategy used by the program ensures that the minimum is calculated considering all possible configurations (both in width and height), it captures all potential edge cases and is, therefore, confirmed to be correct.
