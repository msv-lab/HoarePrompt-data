The variable `n` is assigned a new value from the input, which is converted to an integer. Since the problem states that `n` is already a single integer representing the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw, and the input will be an integer that adheres to the restrictions given (1 <= n <= 10^9), the output state will reflect that `n` now holds the value of that input integer. 

The other variable states remain unaffected as no additional variables are manipulated in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw, where 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
