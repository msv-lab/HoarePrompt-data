Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` starts as 0 for first iteration, `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value, which is the total count of occurrences of `(row == x and col == y)`, `max_questions` equals the initial `max_questions`, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `remaining_questions` will be greater than or equal to 1, and the current values satisfy the condition that `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`.**
