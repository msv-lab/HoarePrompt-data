Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1; if `direction` is 1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` remains equal to `y`, `direction` is changed to -1, and `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0. If `direction` is 1 and `row` is not equal to `n`, then `row` remains equal to `x + direction`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and all other defined variables retain their previously defined values. If `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to `x + 3`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and `direction` is equal to 1, with all other variables remaining unchanged. If `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is not equal to -1, then `row` remains equal to `x + direction`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and all other defined variables remain unchanged.***
