Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1, and `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`. If `direction == 1`, `max_questions` is one greater than its previous value, and if `row` was equal to `n`, then `row` is now two less than its previous value but remains greater than or equal to its previous value plus -1. Otherwise, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, and if `row` is -1, `row` is increased by 2 and `direction` is set to 1.***
