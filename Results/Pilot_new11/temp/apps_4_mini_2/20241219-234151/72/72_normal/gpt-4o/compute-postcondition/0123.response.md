Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` starts as 0 for the first iteration, `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value, `max_questions` equals the initial `max_questions`, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `remaining_questions` will be greater than or equal to 1, and `direction` is equal to 1. If `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise there is no change to these values.***
