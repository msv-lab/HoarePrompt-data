Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 0, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `direction` is not equal to 1 (hence `direction` is -1). If `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1.***
