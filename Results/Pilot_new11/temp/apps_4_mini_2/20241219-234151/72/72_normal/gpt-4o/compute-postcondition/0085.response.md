The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`, changing it from its previous value of `-1`. All other variables in the program remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1; `remaining_questions` is greater than 1; `col` is 0; `row` is -1; `direction` is 1; and `max_questions` is at least 0 (decreased by 1).
