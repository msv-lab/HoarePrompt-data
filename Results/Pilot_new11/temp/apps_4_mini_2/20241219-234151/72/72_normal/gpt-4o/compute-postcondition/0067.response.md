Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, and `col` is equal to `m`. If `direction == 1`, then `max_questions` is increased by 1; if `row` was originally equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 2`. If `row` is greater than or equal to its previous value, then `direction` is set to -1. If `direction` is not 1, and if `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `direction` is set to 1. In addition, if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
