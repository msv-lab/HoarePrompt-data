In the given code snippet, the variable `full_cycle_length` is assigned a value based on the condition of `n`. Specifically, if `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is calculated as `(2 * n - 2) * m`. If `n` is not greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` simply takes the value of `m`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (could be any integer)
- `m` is an integer (could be any integer)
- `k` is a positive integer
- `x` is an integer decreased by 1 (which means x might be less than or equal to 1)
- `y` is `y - 1` (which implies y has a new value but its original state isn't provided)

The impact of the code on the program would be:
1. The value of `full_cycle_length` depends on the value of `n`.
2. If `n > 1`, then `full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m`.
3. If `n <= 1`, then `full_cycle_length = m`.

Therefore, the output state must reflect the computation of `full_cycle_length` depending on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `k` is a positive integer; `x` is an integer decreased by 1; `y` is `y - 1`; `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`.**
