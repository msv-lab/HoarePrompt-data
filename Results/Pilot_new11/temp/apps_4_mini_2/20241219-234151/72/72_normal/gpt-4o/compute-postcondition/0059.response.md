The code snippet assigns the value of `-1` to the variable `direction`. The existing values of `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `row`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is equal to `m`; `row` is greater than or equal to its previous value; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `direction` is -1.**
