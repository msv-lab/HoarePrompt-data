The variable `max_questions` is decremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is equal to `m`, `row` remains unchanged, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is equal to `m`, `row` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
