Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.***
