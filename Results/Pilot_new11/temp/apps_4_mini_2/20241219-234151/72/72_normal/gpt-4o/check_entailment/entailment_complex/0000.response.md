The provided program is intended to meet the requirements of the problem description, which involves calculating how frequently students are asked questions in a specific polling order. Let's assess whether the function correctly implements this logic.

### Key Components of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of five integers: `n` (the number of rows), `m` (the number of pupils per row), `k` (total questions asked), `x` (the specific row Sergei is in), and `y` (the specific seat of Sergei in that row). The program implements adjustments to convert `x` and `y` to zero-based indexing.

2. **Cycle Calculation**: The total number of questions asked in a complete cycle of polling all students (in both directions) is computed correctly. If there's only one row, it's handled appropriately.

3. **Full Cycle Counting**: The program counts how many full cycles of questions can happen within `k` and computes how many remaining questions are left after completely full cycles.

4. **Minimum and Maximum Questions**: The program correctly derives the minimum and maximum number of questions a student can get based on the full cycles. The adjustments made for the edges of the row (first and last) are also logically sound.

5. **Remaining Questions Processing**: A nested loop processes the remaining questions, checking if each pupil is being asked. The logic correctly tracks how many times Sergei is asked and updates the maximum count accordingly.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum number of questions asked to any pupil, the minimum number of questions asked to any pupil, and the exact number of times Sergei is asked.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description:
- The program adheres to all constraints given in the problem description. The calculations consider scenarios where `n` is 1, where `k` is very large, and how that impacts `remaining_questions`.
- It properly tracks how the looping through rows occurs directionally, ensuring that it simulates the asking order described correctly.
- The edge cases about being in the first or last row are handled diligently by adjusting the counts based on the current cycle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented according to the problem description. It logically accounts for all specified conditions and variations, and it processes the input through suitable calculations to produce the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
