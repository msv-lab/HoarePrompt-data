Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)` and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. Otherwise, `x` is greater than 0 and less than `n - 1`, `sergei_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`, while `max_questions` remains as `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)` and `min_questions` is still equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`.***
