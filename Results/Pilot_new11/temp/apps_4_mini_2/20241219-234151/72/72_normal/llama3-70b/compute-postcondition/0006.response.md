Functionality: **The function calculates and prints three values based on the number of rows (n), pupils per row (m), the total number of questions asked (k), and Sergei's position in the classroom defined by row (x) and position (y). Specifically, it computes: 
1. max_asked: The maximum number of questions that could have been asked per pupil using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.
2. min_asked: The minimum number of questions a pupil might have answered, which is computed as `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, ensuring it is at least 1.
3. sergei_asked: The total number of questions Sergei has asked, calculated as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. 

The output reflects these computed values. It is important to note that while y is provided as an input, it is not utilized in any calculations, so its relevance is currently neglected. The function assumes the input values are always within the defined positive integer limits. The final state includes the printed values of max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked that inform about the distribution of questions among pupils and Sergei specifically.**
