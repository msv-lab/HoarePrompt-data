Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the calculation for the maximum and minimum number of questions asked per pupil. The formula used for `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which only accounts for the total number of rows but does not fully reflect the distribution of questions among all pupils. For example, in cases with `k` greater than `m * n`, some pupils might receive more questions than calculated, or others may receive fewer than assumed. 

Additionally, the `min_asked` logic does not correctly account for scenarios where the total question count might fall short of allowing every pupil a minimum count based on the number of times the questioning cycle runs through the rows. 

Moreover, the position `y`, which indicates Sergei's position in the row, is not used in any calculations, leading to an incomplete assessment of the problem.

To demonstrate a specific failure case:
For an input like `5 5 49 3 3`, the expected distribution of questions should reflect that not every pupil received the same number of questions. Yet, the calculations produce results that imply a uniform distribution based on flawed logic. 

Given these inconsistencies, it's clear that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
