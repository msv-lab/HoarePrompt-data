You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's carefully analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Code Analysis
To break down the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:** It reads five integers \( n, m, k, x, y \).
2. **Maximum Questions Asked:** 
   - It calculates `max_asked` as \( (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) \). This formula attempts to find the average number of questions each student is asked after completing full rounds.
3. **Minimum Questions Asked:** 
   - The `min_asked` is calculated as \( \text{max}(1, \text{max_asked} - (n - 1)) \). This tries to ensure that students who might have been less frequently asked still have at least one question considered.
4. **Sergei's Questions:**
   - `sergei_asked` is calculated as \( (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) \% (2 * n) >= n - x + 1) \). This calculation tracks how many questions were asked to Sergei specifically, adjusting based on his position \( x \).

### Edge Cases
We need to check if there are any edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output:

1. **Single Row Case (n = 1):**
   - For example, input \( 1, 5, 10, 1, 1 \):
     - Sergei is the only student. We expect each student to be asked uniformly for 10 questions; hence the output should be `10 10 10`.

2. **Maximum Capacity Case:**
   - When \( n \) or \( m \) is at maximum with significant \( k \):
     - Input \( 100, 100, 1000000000000000000, 100, 100 \):
       - We anticipate it to correctly output maximum, minimum, and Sergei's asking counts according to the defined logic.
  
3. **Asking Beyond Bounds:**
   - Investigate inputs where \( k \) exceeds reasonable asking limits (e.g., \( n, m = 1, 1 \)). Test \( k = 5 \) for input \( 1, 1, 5, 1, 1 \). Expected output is `5 5 5`, revealing if `max_asked` and `min_asked` adheres to logic.

### Testing Example
Let's examine input \( 4, 2, 9, 4, 2 \):
- The sequence of questions gives:
  1. Row 1 -> 1, 2
  2. Row 2 -> 1, 2
  3. Row 3 -> 1, 2
  4. Row 4 -> 1, 2 (Sergei).
  
After 9 questions, after correctly tallying asked questions:
- Maximum should evaluate correctly relative to \( m \) & \( k \).

### Conclusion
Although the formulas for computing `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` seem to stem logically from how queries alternate with bounds of rows and the total number of questions, there are potential precision issues specifically dealing with maximum integer operations and how they yield results beyond 100.

### Correctness Conclusion
After analyzing the functionality and logical boundaries:
- I am unable to identify an input case where the program fails based on the given examples and derived scenarios. Thus:

Correctness: **True**

The program maintains logic fidelity and correctly calculates the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's ask counts according to the outlined behavior of question ordering among pupils.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints three values based on the number of rows (n), pupils per row (m), the total number of questions asked (k), and Sergei's position in the classroom defined by row (x) and position (y). Specifically, it computes: 
1. max_asked: The maximum number of questions that could have been asked per pupil using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.
2. min_asked: The minimum number of questions a pupil might have answered, which is computed as `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, ensuring it is at least 1.
3. sergei_asked: The total number of questions Sergei has asked, calculated as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. 

The output reflects these computed values. It is important to note that while y is provided as an input, it is not utilized in any calculations, so its relevance is currently neglected. The function assumes the input values are always within the defined positive integer limits. The final state includes the printed values of max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked that inform about the distribution of questions among pupils and Sergei specifically.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
