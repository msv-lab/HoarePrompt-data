You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3 8 1 1

Output
3 2 3

Output
101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051


-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and consider edge cases based on the provided inputs:

1. **Understanding the logic of the program**:
   - `max_asked`: The maximum number of questions a student can be asked is determined by calculating how many complete rounds (which ask every student in the classroom) fit into `k` questions.
   - `min_asked`: This value determines the minimum number of times a student can be asked questions, based on the maximum calculated and the total number of students.
   - `sergei_asked`: This counts how many times Sergei (who is located at a specific seat) is asked questions, considering both complete rounds and any extra questions that might fall into his seating.

2. **Potential edge cases**:
   - **Single Row, Multiple Students (n=1)**: The program should handle the case when there is only one row with multiple students correctly. For instance, if `n=1`, `m=3`, and `k=8` (like in the first example), the output should correctly reflect how many times Sergei is asked questions, and the same for the maximum and minimum questions asked by any student.
   - **Max Boundaries of k**: Since `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), we need to consider how the calculations handle large values without causing overflow or incorrect ceiling calculations.

3. **Testing edge cases**:
   - Let's take the input `1 3 8 1 1`. According to the problem description:
     - Students in one row are asked cyclically; everyone should be queried 3 times since \( \left\lfloor \frac{8}{3} \right\rfloor = 2\) full cycles (that covers 6 questions), plus 2 leftover questions.
     - The program output is `3 2 3`, which matches expected.
   - For the input `2 3 5 1 1`:
     - The total number of students would be 6, and in 5 questions, the first student can only be asked 2 times, while others get either 1 or 2.
     - However, the current logic does not explicitly define how errors should be caught when trying to apply the same formula since (2 * n) rounds are not fully utilized.

In conclusion, the program does not appear to account for all configurations explicitly, especially with varying values of `k` that don’t fill a full cycle of asking all students. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could give incorrect outputs for edge cases where `k` does not deliver questions precisely filling the `2*n` cycles. For example, input `2 3 5 1 1` could return incorrect numbers which would not sit true to the problem’s requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints three values based on the number of rows (n), pupils per row (m), the total number of questions asked (k), and Sergei's position in the classroom defined by row (x) and position (y). Specifically, it computes: 
1. max_asked: The maximum number of questions that could have been asked per pupil using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.
2. min_asked: The minimum number of questions a pupil might have answered, which is computed as `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, ensuring it is at least 1.
3. sergei_asked: The total number of questions Sergei has asked, calculated as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. 

The output reflects these computed values. It is important to note that while y is provided as an input, it is not utilized in any calculations, so its relevance is currently neglected. The function assumes the input values are always within the defined positive integer limits. The final state includes the printed values of max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked that inform about the distribution of questions among pupils and Sergei specifically.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
