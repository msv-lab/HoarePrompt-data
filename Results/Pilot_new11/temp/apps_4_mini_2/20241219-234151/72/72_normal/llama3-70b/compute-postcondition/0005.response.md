The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on the positive integer inputs: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` represents the number of rows, `m` the number of pupils per row, `k` the number of questions asked, while `x` and `y` represent Sergei's row and position in that row respectively. The function is expected to return a value based on these inputs. 

Given the defined constraints, the functionality of the function can be described as follows: 

Functionality: **The function operates based on the positive integers n, m, k, x, and y, and returns a result related to the configuration of pupils and questions in a classroom context.**
