Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately captures the functionality and logic of the program based on the problem description. The program correctly calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked of pupils, as well as the specific count for Sergei, adhering to the rules established in the problem prompt. The logic in computing these values is further supported by the annotated version, which clarifies that the input is always within the specified limits and that the outputs are computed correctly in context.

The annotations confirm that:
1. The program computes `max_asked` using a formula that correctly considers the total number of questions (`k`) distributed across all pupils per round.
2. The calculation for `min_asked` guarantees that no pupil is asked fewer than once, adhering to the described expectations.
3. The formula for `sergei_asked` effectively tracks questions directed specifically at Sergei based on his position (`x`).

Thus, overall, the assessment remains intact as the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations substantiate the correctness of its logic and output.
