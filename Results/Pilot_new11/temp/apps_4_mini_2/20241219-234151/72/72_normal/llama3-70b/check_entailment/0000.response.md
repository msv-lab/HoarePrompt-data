To verify the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and consider edge cases based on the provided inputs:

1. **Understanding the logic of the program**:
   - `max_asked`: The maximum number of questions a student can be asked is determined by calculating how many complete rounds (which ask every student in the classroom) fit into `k` questions.
   - `min_asked`: This value determines the minimum number of times a student can be asked questions, based on the maximum calculated and the total number of students.
   - `sergei_asked`: This counts how many times Sergei (who is located at a specific seat) is asked questions, considering both complete rounds and any extra questions that might fall into his seating.

2. **Potential edge cases**:
   - **Single Row, Multiple Students (n=1)**: The program should handle the case when there is only one row with multiple students correctly. For instance, if `n=1`, `m=3`, and `k=8` (like in the first example), the output should correctly reflect how many times Sergei is asked questions, and the same for the maximum and minimum questions asked by any student.
   - **Max Boundaries of k**: Since `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), we need to consider how the calculations handle large values without causing overflow or incorrect ceiling calculations.

3. **Testing edge cases**:
   - Let's take the input `1 3 8 1 1`. According to the problem description:
     - Students in one row are asked cyclically; everyone should be queried 3 times since \( \left\lfloor \frac{8}{3} \right\rfloor = 2\) full cycles (that covers 6 questions), plus 2 leftover questions.
     - The program output is `3 2 3`, which matches expected.
   - For the input `2 3 5 1 1`:
     - The total number of students would be 6, and in 5 questions, the first student can only be asked 2 times, while others get either 1 or 2.
     - However, the current logic does not explicitly define how errors should be caught when trying to apply the same formula since (2 * n) rounds are not fully utilized.

In conclusion, the program does not appear to account for all configurations explicitly, especially with varying values of `k` that don’t fill a full cycle of asking all students. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could give incorrect outputs for edge cases where `k` does not deliver questions precisely filling the `2*n` cycles. For example, input `2 3 5 1 1` could return incorrect numbers which would not sit true to the problem’s requirements.
