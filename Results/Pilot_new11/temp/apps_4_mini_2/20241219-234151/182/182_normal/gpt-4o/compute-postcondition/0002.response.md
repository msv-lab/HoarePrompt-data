The variable `normalized_angle` is calculated as `x % 360`. The expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` computes how many 90-degree turns can be made from the current `normalized_angle`, where `normalized_angle` is guaranteed to be a value between 0 and 359 inclusive (since it's the result of `x % 360`). 

The intermediate step calculates `360 - normalized_angle`, which is the amount needed to reach the next full circle (360 degrees) from the current angle. This result is then integer-divided by 90 to find out how many complete 90-degree turns can be made. Lastly, taking this result modulo 4 ensures that it remains within the bounds (0, 1, 2, 3) which correspond to the direction of the turns.

Given that no other variables are affected by this computation, the output state should clearly reflect the final value of `turns` depending on the value of `x`. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`; `turns` is `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.**
