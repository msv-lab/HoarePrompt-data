To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic behind the implementation.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The camera rotation is given as an integer `x` which can be both positive (clockwise) and negative (counter-clockwise).
2. The goal is to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to minimize the deviation from vertical.
3. Valid inputs include any integer between -10^18 and 10^18, and the result must be the number of 90-degree clockwise turns.

### Program Logic:
The program uses the following logic:

- First, it normalizes the input angle `x` to a value between 0 and 359 using `x % 360`.
- Then it calculates how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed by negating the normalized angle, calculating the effective total needed rotation, and determining how many 90-degree segments fit into that using integer division.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the input angle is exactly 0, the output should be 0 turns, which seems correct.
2. For negative angles, the program should correctly handle the logic of rotation and return the appropriate number of turns.

### Potential Cases to Test:
- **Input: 60**
    - Normalized: 60 -> 1 turn (Correct)
- **Input: -60**
    - Normalized: -60 -> 300 (3 turns)
- **Input: 0**
    - Normalized: 0 -> 0 turns (Correct)
- **Input: -90**
    - Normalized: -90 -> 270 -> needs 6 turns (Correct)
- **Input: 90**
    - Normalized: 90 -> needs 3 turns (Correct)
- **Input: -720**
    - Normalized: 0 -> 0 turns (Correct)
- **Input: 720**
    - Normalized: 0 -> 0 turns (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program logic correctly implements the requirement described in the problem statement. All tested cases return the expected results according to the defined logic of determining the least number of 90-degree rotations.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The program correctly normalizes any integer input angle `x` to a rotating context within the 360 degrees circle, ensuring no information is lost through undivisible turns. It handles both positive and negative angles efficiently while ensuring the output is always in terms of 90-degree rotations. Thus, it fulfills all the requirements outlined in the problem description.
