Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer representing the rotation angle of the camera in degrees, if `x` is equal to 0, the function does not return any value. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 0 and the result of the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is returned, representing the adjusted rotation based on the current angle.***
