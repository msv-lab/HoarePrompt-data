Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not accurately compute the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed for negative angles. The example given in the problem description shows that for an input of `-60`, the expected output is `3`, but the logic within the program would yield an incorrect result (`4`). This discrepancy highlights that the program fails to fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect. The assessment's reasoning aligns with the program analysis, confirming its validity.
