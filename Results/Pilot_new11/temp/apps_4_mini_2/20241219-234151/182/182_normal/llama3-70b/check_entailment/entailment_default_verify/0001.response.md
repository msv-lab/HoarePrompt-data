Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle all possible input angles, particularly when they are outside the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees. For instance, the case with an input of `-180` demonstrates a specific failure: the program outputs `2` while the correct minimum rotations required should be `0`. 

The output hints reveal that the program normalizes the angle to 0-359 degrees and utilizes a modulo operation, which leads to incorrect outputs for specific input cases, particularly with angles that result in a counter-clockwise adjustment. The handling of negative angles, which should be treated distinctly to achieve minimal deviation, is not appropriately managed. 

Consequently, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, thereby reaffirming the original assessment of correctness.
