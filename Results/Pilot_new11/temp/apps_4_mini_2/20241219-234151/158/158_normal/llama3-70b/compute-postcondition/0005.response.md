The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. However, since the provided function definition does not include parameters in its signature, it suggests that the function might not directly take these parameters but rather relies on implicit or global values, or there may be a misunderstanding in the initial presentation. Assuming the parameters are indeed represented in some manner, the exact return value is unspecified based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can simply be described as accepting positive integers constrained between 1 and 1000.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: positive integers a, b, and c within the range of 1 to 1000.**
