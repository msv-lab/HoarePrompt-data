To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression in the code snippet provided. The variable `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

We know that:
- `a` is a positive integer in the range from 1 to 1000.
- `b` and `c` are input integers, but their specific values are unknown.

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```
min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
```
This can be simplified to:
```
min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7
```

Since the output of the `print` function does not alter the variables, we only need to specify any changes or assignments that result from evaluating the code.

The impact of the code is:
- The variable `min_lemon` is defined, representing the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- The output will be `min_lemon * 7`.

Thus, the output state can be expressed as:
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output will be `min_lemon * 7`.**
