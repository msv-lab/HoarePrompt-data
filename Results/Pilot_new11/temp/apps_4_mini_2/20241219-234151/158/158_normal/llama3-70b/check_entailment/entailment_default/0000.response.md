The provided program calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use for his compote based on a specific ratio of 1:2:4. The program reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c), and then computes the maximum number of complete sets of the fruits adhering to the required ratio using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The final output is computed by adding this minimum value to its double and quadruple.

The output hints explain that the function bases its calculation on the minimum of the current number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. Also mentioned in the hints is the lack of error handling for input values, but since the problem statement does not suggest any invalid or edge cases related to the ranges of values (all inputs are required to be positive integers), this does not affect the overall correctness of the solution.

However, to verify the correctness of the program, we should evaluate it against the aforementioned problem description and provided examples:

1. For the inputs `2, 5, 7`:
   - `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`.
   - The output will be `1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.

2. For inputs `4, 7, 13`:
   - `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`.
   - The output will be `3 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is correct.

3. For `2, 3, 2`:
   - `min_lemon = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`.
   - The output will be `0 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 = 0`, which is correct, as Nikolay can't make any compote without sufficient pears.

Since the program handles the required ratio logic correctly and outputs the right values for all provided examples, and given the assumption that input is always valid as stipulated, we can conclude that the program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
