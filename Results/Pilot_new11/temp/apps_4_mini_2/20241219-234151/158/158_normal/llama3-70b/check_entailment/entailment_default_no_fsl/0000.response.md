Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. An example where it fails is when Nikolay has a sufficient quantity of lemons and apples but lacks the required number of pears to satisfy the 1:2:4 ratio. 

For instance:
- If the input is:
  ```
  2
  5
  2
  ```
  The expected output is **0** because there are not enough pears to make any compote (at least 4 pears needed for 1 lemon). However, the program will output:
  ```
  0 + 0 + 0 = 0
  ```
  This is indeed the correct output, but the explanation in the output implies that since there is 1 lemon possible (`2//1`), it will compute the total based on that lemon, but since there aren't enough pears it ultimately leads to a correct output due to the computation.

In another case:
- With input:
  ```
  4
  7
  12
  ```
  The program correctly computes:
  - Minimum based on conditions: `min(4, 7//2, 12//4) -> min(4, 3, 3) -> 3`
  - Computes total: `3 + 3*2 + 3*4 = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is also correct.

Itâ€™s also worth noting the absence of provisions for inputs outside of the specified ranges (1 to 1000), although we assume valid inputs will be provided. However, since there are cases where it misses out on outputs not linked directly to fruit constraints, this indicates the solution does not fully encompass the problem's requirements, hence yielding the verdict of false.

Conclusively, while the outputs might be correctly derived for specified inputs in typical scenarios, the lack of clear handling for cases with potential fruit shortages indicates a flaw, thus making it incorrect.
