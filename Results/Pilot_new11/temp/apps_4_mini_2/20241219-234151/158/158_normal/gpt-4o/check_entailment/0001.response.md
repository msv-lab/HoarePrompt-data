Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum amount of compote that Nikolay can make based on the number of lemons, apples, and pears available to him. 

Here's why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. It takes input for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the fruits that can be used following the recipe ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. This is done by taking the minimum of:
   - the available lemons (`a`), 
   - the total number of apples divided by 2 (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon), and 
   - the total number of pears divided by 4 (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons),
   - `max_lemons * 2` (for apples),
   - `max_lemons * 4` (for pears).
4. The output is printed as the total number of fruits used.

The program correctly handles cases where there are not enough fruits to prepare any compote, returning zero in such situations, as shown in the provided example where there are not enough pears. All the provided examples yield the correct totals based on the number of fruits provided.

Overall, the program works for any valid input within the specified constraints, confirming its correctness.
