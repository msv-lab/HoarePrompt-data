To find the output state, we first identify how the provided code snippet affects the initial variables:

1. `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value of three expressions: 
   - `a`: an input integer,
   - `b // 2`: half of the value of `b`,
   - `c // 4`: a quarter of the value of `c`.

The value of `c` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, making `c // 4` a value between 0 and 250. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as they are, with `max_lemons` being determined by the minimum of the three calculations.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
