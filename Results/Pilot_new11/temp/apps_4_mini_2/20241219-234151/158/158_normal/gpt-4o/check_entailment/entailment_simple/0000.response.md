Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's how it aligns with the task requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers, which represent the quantities of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c), as specified.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio of fruits: 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The correct approach to determine the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used is by calculating:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   This ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the available lemons, the number of apples is exactly double the lemons, and the number of pears is exactly quadruple the lemons.

3. **Total Calculation**: The program then computes the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote with:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`
   This accounts for the contributions of lemons, apples, and pears based on the calculated `max_lemons`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, which is the expected output of the program.

The program handles all edge cases described in the problem statement, such as when one type of fruit is insufficient to meet the ratio requirements. For example, if there are not enough pears to match the required ratio, `max_lemons` will be zero, leading to a total of zero fruits used, which is expected behavior according to the problem description.

In summary, the logic correctly follows the requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that the program will always produce a valid output in accordance with the ratios specified. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
