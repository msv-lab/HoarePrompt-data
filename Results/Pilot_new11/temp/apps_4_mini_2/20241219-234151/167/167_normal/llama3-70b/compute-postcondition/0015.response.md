Postcondition: ***`n` is in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `v` is `a[2]`, `nx` is (a[2] - 1) // y, and `ny` is (a[2] - 1) % y. If the condition abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) is not equal to 1, the function returns False. In case the condition holds true, there is no return value specified for the else part.***
