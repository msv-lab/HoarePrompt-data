Initial State: `n` is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, which is a[0]

Now, `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `v` and an assumed fixed integer `y`. The calculations involve determining how many complete groups of size `y` fit into `v - 1`, and what remains afterwards.

The value of `v` is equal to `a[0]`. Therefore, we can define `nx` and `ny` as follows:
- `nx = (a[0] - 1) // y` which represents the integer division of `v - 1` by `y`.
- `ny = (a[0] - 1) % y` which represents the remainder when `v - 1` is divided by `y`.

The initial state of other variables (`n`, `px`, `py`, and the contents of the list `a`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `v` is `a[0]`, `nx` is `(a[0] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[0] - 1) % y`**.
