The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold an integer value that is provided as input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged because the code only affects `n`. The value of `n` must be within the range of 1 to 10,000,000 as initially stated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000**.
