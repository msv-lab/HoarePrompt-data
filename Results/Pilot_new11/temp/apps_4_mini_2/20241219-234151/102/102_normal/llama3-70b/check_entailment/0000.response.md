Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the logic to check if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It iterates over all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles `x`, calculating the corresponding number of Bars bars `y` that can be purchased with the remaining money. If it finds a combination that satisfies the equation \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\), it outputs "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`. 

The loop continues until `x` reaches the maximum number of bottles that could be bought with `n`, ensuring it accounts for all possibilities. If no valid combination is found, the program correctly outputs "NO".

Given the constraints and the method employed, all edge cases are handled well, which confirms the correctness of the program for the provided problem description.
