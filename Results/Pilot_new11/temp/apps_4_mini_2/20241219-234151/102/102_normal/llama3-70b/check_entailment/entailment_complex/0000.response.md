Correctness: **True** 

The provided program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading:** The program reads three integers (n, a, b) from input. It correctly adheres to the input constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Finding Non-Negative Integers x and y:** The program uses a for loop to iterate through all possible values of x, where x represents the number of Ber-Cola bottles that Vasya can buy. The loop runs from 0 to `n // a`, which is the maximum number of bottles he can afford with `n` burles.

3. **Calculating y:** For each value of x, the program computes y, the number of Bars bars, using the formula `y = (n - x * a) // b`. This calculates how many Bars bars can be bought with the remaining money after buying x bottles of Ber-Cola. The program ensures that both x and y are non-negative integers.

4. **Checking the Condition:** The condition `if x * a + y * b == n:` checks if the current combination (x, y) can indeed spend all n burles. If a valid combination is found, the program outputs "YES" along with the values of x and y, then exits.

5. **Final Case Check:** If no valid combinations are found after completing the loop, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly n burles with the given prices.

6. **Correctness for All Cases:** The program effectively explores all possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the spending equation x * a + y * b = n. The boundaries and checks in the loop ensure that no valid case is missed. This means that, as long as there are combinations within the provided constraints, the program will find them.

By implementing these steps, the program follows the logic needed to determine whether Vasya can spend his money in the way described in the problem statement. It produces the correct output based on the conditions given, ensuring its correctness.
