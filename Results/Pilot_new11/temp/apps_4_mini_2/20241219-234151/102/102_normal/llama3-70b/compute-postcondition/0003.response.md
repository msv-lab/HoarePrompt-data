To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run.

The loop is defined as:
```
for x in range(n // a + 1):
```

1. The loop's effectiveness depends on the value of `n // a + 1`. For the loop to execute, we need the result of `n // a + 1` to be at least 1.
2. The expression `n // a` performs integer division. Therefore, for the loop to run at all, we need `n // a` to be non-negative. This happens only if `n` is non-negative and `a` is positive.
3. When `n // a` is zero, that means that `n` is less than `a`, and the loop will execute exactly once (as `range(1)` will yield one iteration with `x` equal to 0).
4. If `n` is zero or more, and `a` is positive, the loop can execute. If `a` is zero, this leads to a division-by-zero scenario, which is invalid.
5. The variable `x` will start at 0 in its first iteration.

Therefore, we can conclude what the states need to be:

- `n` should be non-negative (zero or positive) for the loop to run,
- `a` must be greater than 0 to ensure there is no division by zero,
- and during the loop's first iteration, `x` will be 0.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0**
