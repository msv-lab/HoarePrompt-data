The code `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` assigns to `max_count` the greater of its current value and `current_count`. The initial state indicates that `max_count` is `0` and `current_count` is `0`. Since both are equal, `max_count` will remain `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and the character `char` is not a lowercase letter.**
