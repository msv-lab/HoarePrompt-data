The statement `current_set = set()` initializes a new empty set and assigns it to the variable `current_set`. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `max_count` are not affected by this statement. The variable `current_set` now holds an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set.**
