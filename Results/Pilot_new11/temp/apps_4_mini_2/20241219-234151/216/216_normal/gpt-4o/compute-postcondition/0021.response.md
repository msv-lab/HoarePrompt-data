Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is either 0 or 1 depending on `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 1 if the second character in `s` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` remains 0, and `char` is the second character in `s`.**
