The statement `current_set.clear()` removes all items from the `current_set`, which was initially an empty set. Since the set is empty, clearing it does not change its state; it remains an empty set. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and the character `char` is not a lowercase letter**.
