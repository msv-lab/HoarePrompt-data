You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, let's analyze the logic in the function.

The key requirements from the problem description are:
1. Identify the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in segments of the string separated by uppercase letters.
2. Consider segments of lowercase letters that are not interrupted by uppercase letters.

Now, looking at the program, we can break down what it does:
1. It iterates through each character of the string.
2. If the character is lowercase and not already in the `current_set`, it adds it to the set and increments the current count.
3. If an uppercase letter is encountered, it checks if the current count is the maximum found so far, clears the set, and resets the count for the next segment.
4. After finishing the loop, it checks again to see if the current count is the maximum (in case the string ends with a segment of lowercase letters).

However, there is a potential flaw here in how it calculates the maximum set of distinct lowercase letters when encountering uppercase letters. Specifically, if the same lowercase letter appears multiple times within the segment between two uppercase letters, it needs only to be counted once. The program does handle this correctly by using a set, but it does not handle cases where the same set of lowercase letters might repeat.

To find a potential case where the program might not perform as expected, consider the input:
```
Input
6
aAaAbB
```
According to this input:
- It has two segments of lowercase letters "a" before the first 'A' and "a" before the second 'B'. However, it fails to count 'a' properly since the current logic resets upon encountering 'A' and does not yield a proper count for characters before 'B' after letter 'A'.

In this case, the expected output would be the maximum of 1, counting only 'a' once, but the program would calculate a maximum from separated counts, leading to an incorrect understanding from such inputs.

Therefore, we find that:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_count` is the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in any contiguous segment of lowercase letters in `s`; `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0 after the last character has been processed. If `s` contains no lowercase letters, `max_count` will be 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of letters in a case-sensitive manner. It calculates and prints the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in any contiguous segment of `s` consisting solely of lowercase letters. If no lowercase letters are present in `s`, it will return 0. The function maintains a count of unique lowercase letters and resets this count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered, thus only counting segments of lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count found across all segments processed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
