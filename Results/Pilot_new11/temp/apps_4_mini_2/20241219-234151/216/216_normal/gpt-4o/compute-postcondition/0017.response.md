The `current_set` is updated to include the `char`, which is the second character in the string `s`. The value of `current_count` may be affected based on whether the new `char` is a lowercase letter that was not already in `current_set`. Since we are only adding `char` to `current_set`, we must update the state accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` includes `char`; `current_count` is 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, otherwise it remains 0; `char` is the second character in `s`.**
