Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; if `char` (the second character in `s`) is a lowercase letter, then if it is not in `current_set`, `current_set` includes `char`, and `current_count` is updated to 2; otherwise, `current_count` remains 1. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `max_count` is either 0 or 1 depending on `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0.***
