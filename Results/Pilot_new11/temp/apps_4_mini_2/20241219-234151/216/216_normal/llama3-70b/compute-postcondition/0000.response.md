The value of `n` is now assigned the integer resulted from `int(input())`. The previous conditions specify that `n` was an integer between 1 and 200. The output state does not change the string `s`, as it remains defined as a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to the previous `n`. Thus, we maintain the validity of both conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200; `s` is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to the value of `n`.**
