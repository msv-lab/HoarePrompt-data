Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, without taking into account the conditions that must be met for a set of positions to be considered "pretty". 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aAbAb
```
The expected output should be `1`, since the only lowercase letter 'a' at position 0 can be included without any uppercase letters between positions. However, the program would output `3`, counting all lowercase letters without considering the uppercase letters that separate them.

This indicates that the logic for determining positions that can be included in a "pretty" set is missing, leading to an incorrect implementation. Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem statement for all potential cases.
