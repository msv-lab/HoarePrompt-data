The `print(len(lowercase))` statement outputs the length of the `lowercase` list, which contains the indices of all lowercase characters in the input string `s`. The variable `lowercase` remains unchanged, only its length is printed. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, and `s` is a string of that length consisting of both lowercase and uppercase letters. The updated output does not change the initial preconditions but specifies the length of the `lowercase` list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and uppercase letters; `lowercase` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are lowercase, and `len(lowercase)` has been printed.**
