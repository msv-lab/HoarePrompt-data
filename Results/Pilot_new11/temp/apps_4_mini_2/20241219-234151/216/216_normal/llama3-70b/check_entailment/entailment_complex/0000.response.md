The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Requirement**: The problem's goal is to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in a string `s`, where these letters must not have any uppercase letters between their respective positions in the string.

2. **Program Functionality**: The function `func()` reads the input string and counts the number of lowercase letters but does not consider the distinctness of those letters or whether they are separated by uppercase letters as required by the problem statement.

3. **Failure to Meet Requirements**:
   - The program simply counts how many lowercase letters exist in the string without any regard for whether they are distinct and whether there are uppercase letters in between them. 
   - For instance, in the case of the input `aaaaBaabAbA`, the output produced by the program would incorrectly suggest there are 8 lowercase letters, while the correct maximum pretty set is only 2.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not implement the necessary logic to satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description (distinctness and absence of uppercase letters in between), it fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
