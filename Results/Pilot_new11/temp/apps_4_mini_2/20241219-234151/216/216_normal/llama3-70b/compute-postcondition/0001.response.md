The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input of length equal to `n`. The initial state indicates that `s` is precisely this input string and that it must consist only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to the value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged; however, `s` now holds the new string provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`.**
