To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The program attempts to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
2. \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

We analyze a potential issue with the logic for determining valid points based on the area.

1. **Calculating Area**: The area is first calculated by the formula `area = n * m / k`. The program then checks if this area is an integer.
   - If \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer, it is correctly outputting "NO".

2. **Checking Area is Zero**: If the area turns out to be 0 (which should never happen due to the constraints \(n, m \geq 1\)), it outputs "NO". 

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The algorithm tries to find the coordinates based on specific checks for \(2 \times \text{area}\) and uses fixed coordinates for points like (0, 0) and attempted points like \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) or \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\).

### Potential Issues:

1. **Area Calculation**: The area must be computed accurately, and integral checks must take into account whether \(k\) divides \(nm\) precisely. If \(nm\) is not divisible by \(k\) and the output is being computed through double the area, the triangle might not actually exist.

2. **Point Validity**: The choices of points \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \) or \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \) are based on certain assumptions about the relation between `area` and `n` or `m`. For high values of `k` resulting in very small area, this could yield invalid coordinates exceeding \(n\) or \(m\).

3. **Corner Cases**: For input values \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), the area becomes \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer, hence outputting "NO" rightly. However, increasing \(k\) while keeping \(n\) and \(m\) small can lead to premature output without exploring possible integer point configurations.

4. **No Output for Certain Cases**: Some cases may yield no valid outputs if they fall through the checks without being handled. For instance, if \( nm < k \) or odd \( \frac{nm}{k} \) where points cannot be chosen appropriately might be overlooked.

### Conclusion:

Due to the above potential issues, the program is flawed in some scenarios and can lead to incorrect outputs. Certain numerical configurations, especially where the relations don't hold for \(x, y\) bounds, are not handled explicitly.

Correctness: **False**. 

In particular, consider input values like \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 8\). The area is \(\frac{16}{8} = 2\), but the point selection logic could yield negative coordinates or exceed bounds, leading to an inability to create a triangle satisfying the area condition due to not establishing a true triangle structure within valid bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
