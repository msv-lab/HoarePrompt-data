To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Area Calculation**: It calculates the area required for the triangle using `area = n * m / k`.
3. **Integer Area Check**: The program checks if the area is an integer. If not, it prints "NO".
4. **Non-zero Area Check**: If the area is zero (which could theoretically happen depending on `n`, `m`, and `k`), it again prints "NO".
5. **Output of Points**:
   - When `2 * area <= n`, it prints points `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.
   - When `2 * area <= m`, it prints points `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it defaults to using `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.

### Points of Interest
- The area is computed as `n * m / k`. It's crucial that this results in an integer. If any non-integer area is possible with the given constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`, the program should print "NO".
- The program lacks checks on the validity of the points produced. The points should not only be valid integer coordinates but also must form a triangle that actually achieves the calculated area.

### Edge Cases
To check if the program is correct, I can think of potential edge cases:
1. **When `k` is equal to `nm`**: This leads to an area of 1 (if `k` divides without a remainder). The chosen points might not form a valid triangle or might extend beyond the bounds defined by `n` and `m`.
  
   Input:  
   ```
   1 1 1
   ```
   
   Expected Output:  
   ```
   NO
   ```

   The area being `1 * 1 / 1 = 1` is valid, but the program outputs “YES” and the points `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,0)` which do not form a valid triangle since all three points are collinear.

2. **When the area is a non-integer**: This is already covered in the program; however, the area being non-integer, or boundary cases where `n` or `m` is minimal could produce unexpected outputs.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not consistently meet the requirements laid out in the original problem description because there can be valid configurations where it outputs points that do not form a valid triangle:

Thus, in terms of the problem statement specifications and correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The specific failures identified indicate that there exist inputs that yield incorrect results per the problem's requirements regarding forming valid triangles with the specified area.
