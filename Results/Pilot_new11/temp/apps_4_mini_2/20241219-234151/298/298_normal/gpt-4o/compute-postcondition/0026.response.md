Functionality: **The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, calculates the value of `area` as `(n * m) / k`, and checks specific conditions to determine the output. If `area` is not an integer or if it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by two pairs of integers that represent coordinates, which depend on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. The potential outputs are coordinates that signify different positions based on these conditions. This function does not return any values; it solely prints the results based on the calculations and checks performed.**
