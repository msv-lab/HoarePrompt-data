Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer input between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer input between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k` which remains an integer, and the program outputs 'YES'. The current value of `area` multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to `n`.***
