The value of `area` is assigned the result of the expression `n * m / k`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, the values of `area` will depend on their input values. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as input integers, while `area` becomes the result of the multiplication of `n` and `m`, divided by `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.**
