Correctness: **False**

The given program does not implement any logic that directly matches the problem description. The problem requires finding three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the provided code contains only three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that seem to be concerned with finding the greatest common divisor and possibly with calculating the coefficients of the linear combination, but they do not address the problem at hand of calculating triangle coordinates or checking if such coordinates exist.

Moreover, the program lacks the main logic to determine whether the desired triangle can be formed with the specified area, and it does not handle input or produce the required output based on the problem's conditions.

Considering these points, the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description, and it cannot handle any cases where valid points might be present or absent. Therefore, it is incorrect.
