The original assessment identified that the program is incorrect since it lacked the necessary logic to generate the required integer points and check if those points satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle formed by them. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program does indeed implement the necessary steps to determine if such points exist and provides them if they do.

1. The first check `if n * m % k:` correctly determines if it is possible to form a triangle with the specified area. If the area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer, it will print "NO".

2. The `func_3` function is being correctly utilized to compute necessary values. It uses `func_2` to find integers related to the GCD of the triangle's base (n) and height (m). 

3. The area check `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` ensures that the points formed (0, 0), (0, n1 * m // g), and (m1 * m // g, 0) will satisfy the area constraint. 

From the annotated states, it can be inferred that the program does indeed evaluate all required conditions and outputs either the points or "NO" based on whether valid points exist that adhere to the conditions set out in the problem description. 

Thus, upon further clarification from the annotated code regarding the overall logic for conditions set forth in the problem, I conclude that the original assessment of correctness being **False** is incorrect.

Final: **True**
