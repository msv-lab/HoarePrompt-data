Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Below are the key issues:

1. **Area Calculation**: The goal is to find three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the program only checks if \(n \cdot m \mod k\) is zero to determine whether a triangle can be formed. This condition alone does not guarantee that a triangle with the required area exists.

2. **Triangle Area Representation**: While the area of a triangle can be calculated using the vertices' coordinates, the program does not compute the area correctly based on its output points. Specifically, it outputs points derived from functions but does not validate the resultant points to ensure the area calculation is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

3. **Points Generation**: The program aims to generate points using the function `func_3`, but the logic for generating valid triangle points lacks validation that ensures they fall within the boundaries imposed by \(n\) and \(m\). The outputs given in the example may not necessarily yield an area of \(\frac{nm}{k}\) due to undefined dependencies on the values returned by the function.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program should handle scenarios where \(n\) or \(m\) leads to invalid triangle configurations (like when \(k\) is large relative to \(n\) and \(m\)). 

In summary, the program does not comprehensively check for valid point generation nor does it guarantee the required area, thus failing to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
