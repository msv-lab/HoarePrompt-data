Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the provided program does not contain any logic to determine if points form a triangle of the required area. 

The lack of any implementation related to point generation or area calculation for given points signifies that the program is incomplete and will not yield valid results for determining whether such points exist or not.

For instance, even with input \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\), there could be potential scenarios where the resultant area is achievable but the program will simply not produce valid triples of points or will output "NO" due to lack of logic. 

Thus, since the necessary functionality to check for triangle area and to return appropriate coordinates based on the input conditions is missing, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement.
