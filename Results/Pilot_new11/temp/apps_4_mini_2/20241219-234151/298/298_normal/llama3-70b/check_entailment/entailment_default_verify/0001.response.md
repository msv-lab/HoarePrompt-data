Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not implement any logic relevant to the problem description. The problem requires finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specified area, while the provided code consists solely of helper functions focused on computing the greatest common divisor and linear combinations, which do not address the task of checking for potentially valid triangle coordinates. The functions do not process the input or derive the coordinates needed to meet the specified area requirement, leading to the conclusion that the program cannot fulfill the stated goals of the problem. Hence, the program's correctness is definitively false.
