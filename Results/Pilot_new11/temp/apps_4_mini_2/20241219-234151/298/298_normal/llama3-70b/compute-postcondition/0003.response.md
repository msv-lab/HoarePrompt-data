Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, constrained to the range 1 to 10^9. It calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function then returns a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. The function's final output encapsulates both the results from `func_2` and a computed value that is dependent on the inputs `a` and `b`. There are no checks or exception handling for potential invalid states or ranges beyond the provided constraints in the comments, but the code assumes `func_2` will return valid outputs.
