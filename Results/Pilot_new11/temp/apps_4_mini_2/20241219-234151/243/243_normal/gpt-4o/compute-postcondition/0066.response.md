According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` and its comparison to the value `m`. The loop can execute if the result of `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. 

Right before the loop, we know that:
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000),
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`,
- `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

However, we do not have information about the current value of `left` or the outcome of `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute one time, it is necessary for `func_1(left)` to be exactly equal to `m`. Since we do not know the output of `func_1(left)`, we need to ensure that it is able to equal `m`.

To ensure that this condition is satisfied, we can adjust the state by specifying that `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; func_1(left) must be equal to m**
