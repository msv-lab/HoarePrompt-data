Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`. Otherwise, `left` is determined as the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `right` is set to `mid + k` for some integer k greater than 1, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.***
