The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `right` is `mid + 1`, so the new value of `right` becomes `mid + 2`. The values of `left`, `m`, `low`, and `high` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m.
