The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Prior to this line, `right` was equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. After the increment, `right` will be equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 2`; `func_1(right) must equal m`**.
