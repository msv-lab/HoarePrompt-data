The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The initial state specifies that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and consequently, it is guaranteed to be an integer within the range defined by `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, and `result`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid**.
