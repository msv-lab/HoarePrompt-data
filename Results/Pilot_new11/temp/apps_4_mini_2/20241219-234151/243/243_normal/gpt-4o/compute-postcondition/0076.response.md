To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition, which is `func_1(right) == m`. This condition requires that the result of `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 2`.
- The function call `func_1(right)` must return `m` for the loop to execute again.

Since this condition is already in place (i.e., `func_1(right)` must equal `m`), no adjustments are needed to either `right` or `m` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Thus, the state remains unchanged for the loop to proceed in the next iteration.

State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 2`; `func_1(right) must equal m`**
