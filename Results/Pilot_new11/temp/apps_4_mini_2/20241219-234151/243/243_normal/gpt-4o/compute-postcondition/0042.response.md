According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the function `func_1(left)` returning the value `m`. The loop will continue as long as this condition holds true.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `left` has been adjusted to be one less than its previous value. This means that after the last iteration, `left` is now at a value that is lower than before. Since `m` is a positive integer and bounded between 1 and 100,000, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` still returns `m` for the loop to execute one more time.

In order for the loop to execute again, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` still returns `m`. Given that `left` has been adjusted down by 1, we need to at least ensure that `func_1(left - 1)` remains equal to `m`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the condition to ensure that the output from `func_1(left)` can still be equal to `m` after `left` has been decreased. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `left` is adjusted to be such that func_1(left) must still equal m**
