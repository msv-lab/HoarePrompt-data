According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`. The left variable is currently `left_prev - 1`. In order for `func_1(left)` to return `m` in the next iteration, the condition must be satisfied that `func_1(left_prev - 1)` equals `m`. 

Since the state mentions that `left` is `left_prev - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(left_prev - 1)` equals `m`. Since `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, we have no information denying `func_1(left)` from potentially equalling `m` if the value of `left` is adjusted to match the required input scenario for the function.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to specify that `left` must be set such that it allows `func_1(left)` to equal to `m`, without changing other states than `left`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` is set to the value that satisfies func_1(left) == m; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m**
