According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the function call `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must return exactly `m`. 

Given that `zeroes` is defined as `func_1(mid)` and that `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, it does not provide direct information about `func_1(left)`. It is possible that the function could return a value less than `m` for the current value of `left`, which would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to either adjust the value of `left` such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`, or ensure that `left` is set to a value that hasn't been evaluated (which we cannot assume).

As `m` is a positive integer and `zeroes` (the output of `func_1(mid)`) is less than or equal to `m`, we can't confirm that `func_1(left) == m` without additional information about how the function `func_1` behaves at `left`. Since we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, we can conclude that we need to modify `left` appropriately or we need to analyze the function further.

To facilitate the loop executing once, we can set `left` to a new value that can ensure `func_1(left)` returns `m`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` must be adjusted so that func_1(left) equals m; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m**
